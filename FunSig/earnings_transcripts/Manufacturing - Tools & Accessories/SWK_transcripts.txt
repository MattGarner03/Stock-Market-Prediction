===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2025 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis M. Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2025 first quarter webcast. Here today, in addition to myself is Don Allan, President and CEO; Chris Nelson, COO, EVP, and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning, Don, Chris and Pat will review our 2025 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results today may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing. Additionally, we may also reference non-GAAP financial measures during the call. For applicable reconciliations to the related GAAP financial measures and additional information, please refer to the appendix of the supplemental presentation and the corresponding press release, which are available on our website under the IR section. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Thank you, Dennis and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by recognizing that our transformation is working, and we are focused on seeing it through to completion to drive sustainable market share gains. With operations excellence at our core, we believe the actions we are taking improve our ability to seize the long-term opportunities within the attractive markets that we serve. As I've said many times, Stanley Black & Decker has incredibly talented people, powerful brands, and an amazing innovation machine. These foundational traits have made us an industry leader for many years. Over the past three years, we have built strong capabilities in our supply chain, which we intend to draw upon as we continue to navigate this moment. We also have been investing significantly in our end users and channel customers to provide the best innovation, service, and experience. We intend to continue investing in growth and innovation, even in this dynamic period. We've been planning for some time for the possibility that U.S. trade policy would change significantly and outlined a three-pronged execution plan of supply chain mitigation, price increases, and partnering with the U.S. administration. While the magnitude and frequency of these changes has exceeded our expectations, we have been and remain prepared to address this dynamic trade environment, and we are responding. As you will hear from the team today, we have a plan for tariffs and have been executing on key elements that will help us mitigate the impact on our business. Over the past several years, we have substantially reduced our China manufacturing footprint, which serves the U.S. market. We believe we have the most flexible supply chain footprint in the industry, as we now have significant hubs in the U.S., Mexico, and Southeast Asia that serve the U.S. market. As we navigate these shifts in trade policy, we are starting from a strong position due to these existing hubs. We intend to build upon them to minimize the impact of higher input costs from tariffs over the next 12 to 24 months. Prices increases will be necessary in the U.S. market due to the current tariffs, and we have implemented a substantial increase in April. We have and plan to continue to invest time with the U.S. administration as they work to achieve the President's trade goals. Now I want to focus on our performance this quarter. I'm pleased to report that the company's first quarter represented another step forward against our transformation. We delivered a solid start to the year with organic revenue growth and year-over-year gross margin expansion, both key measures of continued progress towards our strategic objectives. Organic growth was up 1% led by solid outdoor performance. Our powerhouse and professionally focused to all brand extended its streak of year-over-year revenue growth with power tools, hand tools, accessories and storage and outdoor all contributing. These organic growth drivers were more than offset by two points of pressure from the final quarter of lapping the infrastructure business divestiture and two points of currency pressure. Take it together, this resulted in total revenue of $3.7 billion, consistent with our plans. North American and end market demand, as measured by our retail POS, in the first quarter was generally consistent with the stable trends we observed exiting 2024. The year started slow, but March improved and April looked solid as well. Adjusted gross margin continued to improve on a year-over-year basis. The first quarter adjusted rate of 30.4% was up 140 basis points versus last year. Supply chain efficiencies and positive mixed benefits from new innovation launches were partially offset by freight inflation and the initial impact from China and Mexico tariffs initiated in February. We are firmly executing against our strategic objectives and are on track with our transformation plan. We intend to successfully complete our transformation in 2025 and meet our $2 billion savings target. The organic growth we delivered in the first quarter, along with the year-over-year gross margin expansion, translated to solid adjusted EBITDA performance. Net of growth investments, adjusted EBITDA margin approached 10%, an increase of approximately 80 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.75, up 34% versus last year. First quarter free cash outflow was $485 million, relatively consistent with both the prior year and typical historical seasonality. And impressive results considering we pursued targeted inventory investments to navigate the current trade situation. Overall a solid quarter as we continue to make meaningful progress on what is within our control. I want to thank the organization for staying focused on execution and making forward progress once again. We clearly are entering a dynamic period with reduced visibility albeit with relatively stable demand based on what we are seeing in the market and across the business. While we don't know the full picture of how tariffs will impact the U.S. economy or demand in our categories, we are preparing ourselves for multiple demand scenarios this year. And even though it's too early to predict all the different direct and indirect impacts, as I mentioned earlier, we do believe the current trade policies will prompt significant price increases for companies in our industry and many others. We will continue to monitor these evolving policies as well as project the potential effects on the operating and demand environments to remain agile and responsive to evolving market conditions. Over the past few years we have strengthened our execution capability and have consistently delivered results in an overall weak market backdrop. Our strategic decisions are aimed at navigating the immediate challenges while positioning the company for sustained long-term success. Our top priorities remain clear and intact. We are accelerating our growth culture and placing a priority on serving our end-users and customers. We expect to control costs while prioritizing growth investments as we continue our journey to sustainable share gains. We also expect commercial opportunities to emerge for our businesses, particularly as we further leverage our North American footprint to serve local markets. We remain focused on generating cash and strengthening our balance sheet. Long-term we intend to mitigate the cost burden of tariffs through supply chain adjustments and other cost controls, some of which are already in flight while some will take time to fully implement. As such, pricing is a necessary initial response to protect our cash flow so that we have time for the full effect of our supply chain strategies to hit our P&L and we can continue to fuel innovation. In this context, as I mentioned earlier, we implemented an initial U.S. tools and outdoor price increase in April and notified our customers that further price action is likely required if existing tariffs stay at current levels. To summarize, even in the current circumstances, we believe we are decisively advancing towards the successful completion of our strategic transformation, building a sustainable productivity engine to fund growth investments and support our long-term margin journey. The capabilities we've built during this process will aid in accelerating adjustments to adapt to the new economic backdrop. Chris will share more about the near-term opportunities that we are pursuing in just a moment. Pat then will share more detail on financial planning. Given the fluid environment, today we are providing our latest thoughts on 2025 with sensitivities to help model different scenarios. We have our sights set on share gain and long-term value creation and are committed to making the necessary decisions along the way to achieve our long-term financial objectives. I will now pass it to Chris Nelson, who will review the business segment performance and provide more context on how we successfully execute our strategy in a volatile trade environment.
Christopher J. Nelson: Thank you, Don and good morning, everyone. I will start with the tools and outdoor first quarter operating performance. Revenue was approximately $3.3 billion flat versus the first quarter 2024. Organic revenue grew 1% driven by volume. DEWALT was a key contributor to this performance in the quarter with revenue up mid-single digits. Driven by professional demand, the brand achieved its eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth. In addition, we had strong outdoor product shipments ahead of the season. These positive factors were partially offset by a cautious consumer and continued softness in the DIY market. Adjusted segment margin was 9.6%, a 110 basis point improvement as compared to the first quarter of last year. This was largely attributable to supply chain efficiencies and new innovation benefits. Partially offsetting this was freight inflation, the initial impacts from incremental tariffs announced during the first quarter, and targeted investments in growth initiatives. Turning to performance by product line, Power Tools experienced a 2% organic revenue decline as the consumer DIY category remained pressured. Hand Tools achieved 1% organic revenue growth supported by strong reception from customers of new products designed with an end-user-centric mindset to improve their productivity. A couple of examples include the DEWALT Construction Jack, which offers hands-free lift assistance, and the DEWALT TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL Modular Workstation System. Outdoor posted 6% organic growth, led by a return to normal seasonal load-ins with our channel partners, as well as new listings and expanded spring promotional placements at our retail partners. Focusing on tools and outdoor performance by region, North America recorded a 2% organic revenue increase, reflecting the overall segment's growth factors. As Don stated, total quarter U.S. POS demand was stable, and that continued into April. We are tracking demand closely and looking for signs of change in consumer behaviors, especially as our first round of price increases begin to hit the shelf. Europe organic growth was flat, as our investments in Eastern Europe are yielding results, which counteracted a generally weak market backdrop due to macro factors. Rest of world organic revenue was down 3%, as Latin America was comping robust growth last year. Based on current underlying market demand, we expect to return to growth in the coming quarters. In summary, the growth and margin performance was a solid start to 2025 and was in line with our plan for the segment. Now, let's transition to engineered fastening, which was our former industrial segment. We made this name change to reflect the segment's more focused portfolio. On a reported basis, first quarter revenue for engineered fastening was down 21% versus prior year. 16 points of the decline was attributable to the final quarter of lapping the infrastructure business divestiture. Other factors impacting revenue included a one-point increase in price, two points of volume pressure, two points of currency pressure, and a two-point decline due to a product line transfer to the tools and outdoor segment. All told, there was a slight organic revenue decline of 1%. The automotive business faced a high single-digit organic decline, primarily due to OEMs reducing light vehicle production schedules and tightening capital expenditures. The aerospace business generated robust mid-teens organic growth driven by strong performance in fasteners and fittings. This business has a multi-year backlog and growth outlook reinforced by new content wins and a high booking rate. General industrial fasteners achieved low single-digit organic growth reflecting steady demand. The Engineered Fastening adjusted segment margin rate was 10.1% for the quarter. This is a decline from the previous year largely due to softness in high margin automotive products. Successfully completing our transformation in 2025 remains a top priority and is core to improving our cost structure, advancing customer-focused innovation, and driving our growth initiatives with the underlying objective of generating profitable and sustainable market share gains. As it relates to costs, we continue actively implementing our series of initiatives which are projected to yield approximately $2 billion of pre-tax run rate cost savings, of which $1.5 billion is coming from the supply chain. We have identified the key sources of savings this year and are progressing down the path towards our 2025 full-year target of $500 million of savings. In the first quarter, we achieved approximately $130 million in pre-tax run rate cost savings, bringing our total savings to approximately $1.7 billion since the program's inception. We continue to enhance our strong culture of operational excellence and build a sustainable productivity engine, both of which we believe are critical to funding growth investments and achieving our long-term 35% plus adjusted gross margin goal. Accelerating our growth culture is also key. Our teams are focused on further enhancing service for our end users and customers as we continuously improve our supply chain. The right side of the page highlights two examples of how we are seizing opportunities with priority end users in attractive markets and concentrating investments behind our core brands. One key initiative is increasing DEWALT penetration in Saudi Arabia, a market in which we've historically been underweight. We are taking a local and focused market activation approach to serve our customers and gain market share in a region that is experiencing robust construction growth. One strategy we're pursuing to drive growth is portable jobsite containers that operate as mobile service stations. These containers offer a range of efficiency driving solutions, including training, tool repair, and loan and purchase options to reduce downtime on the job site. This quarter, we also launched DEWALT TOUGHWIRE, a versatile cable hanger system revolutionizing HVAC, sheet metal, electrical, and plumbing trade applications with customizable suspension solutions. Informed and inspired by our professional end users, this system is designed to improve efficiency and simplify installations. These are just two examples of many across our portfolio to illustrate how we are innovating with purpose and addressing unique challenges of tradespeople with safe, productivity enhancing, and durable solutions. We believe we are taking the right actions to thoughtfully and aggressively prioritize resources to deliver consistent profitable share gain. Like many companies with global supply chains, we are currently navigating a frequently changing and complex operating environment. As we take decisive actions, our goal is to position the business for success with focus on achieving our long-term financial objectives. It is crucial that we balance meeting the near-term needs of the business with preserving and maximizing long-term value, all while maintaining our customer-first mindset. Our business teams are continuously assessing the evolving trade policies and diligently evaluating their impacts on our global supply chain and our business. In October of last year, we outlined how we were enhancing our preparations to mitigate the potential impact of higher tariffs, and we have continued to stay true to our plans and the four guiding principles behind them. First and foremost, we are committed to serving our customers and end-users during this dynamic period. Our end-users' core needs don't change with changes in the macroeconomic environment. They still demand solutions that deliver high performance, safety, and productivity. We intend to be here for them and to continue to invest responsibly in growth and innovation, even in this dynamic period. Second, we are working to minimize the impact of higher input costs from tariffs by accelerating the repositioning of our supply chain. We estimate this to be a 12 to 24-month process, and we believe there are adjustments that could begin to contribute to reducing the impact this year. Today, approximately 15% of our supply chain for the U.S. comes from China. Through our mitigation efforts, we're focused on effectively being out of China supply for the U.S. business in the 12 to 24-month time period. This is a high priority and will remain a key focus even if China tariffs go to lower levels. We also have plans to increase our USMCA compliance from where it stands today at just below one-third of Mexico's supply for the U.S. Third, we are moving with speed on price increases. We are taking a judicious approach, maintaining a long-term perspective as we make the adjustments necessary to protect our cash flow, EBITDA, and margin structure. Finally, we continue to engage with the U.S. administration as they work to achieve their trade-related goals. Turning to the current situation, you can see our production mix from the U.S., Mexico, and China that we've previously disclosed to help size the potential impact of changes in policy. It's important to note that we have developed a flexible footprint to leverage as trade policy evolves. Of the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in supply from the rest of the world, 75% of that is comprised of four countries, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand. Additionally, our long-held local-for-local manufacturing and distribution strategy strongly resonates today with greater than 60% of our costs located in North America. We believe we have created a flexible and industry-leading footprint for global tools and outdoor companies that can be a competitive advantage in this environment. A few updates on the mitigation actions. First on price. In April, we successfully implemented a high single-digit average price increase across our United States retail partners. Given the magnitude of the current tariff rates, we are actively engaged with our channel partners about a second price increase, targeting implementation at the beginning of the third quarter. As it relates to our supply chain moves, the teams are actively prioritizing projects that we believe deliver the highest value at the quickest pace. For example, we have opportunities in our supply chain to move dual-sourced SKUs out of China and into Mexico. Additionally, we are pursuing relatively straightforward supply adjustments to increase the amount of USMCA-qualified product coming from Mexico. With all that in mind, based on our understanding of trade policy as it stands today, our current estimated 2025 headwind net of mitigation is approximately $0.75 on an adjusted EPS basis. In addition to pursuing mitigation actions, we are also evaluating new commercial opportunities which leverage our U.S. plants. We manufacture a significant amount of outdoor hand tools, storage, and engineered fasteners in America. We will remain agile as the policy landscape evolves. And in a moment, Pat will outline more details for scenario planning purposes. When presented with an environment like this current one, it requires strong coordination across our enterprise to ensure our response is well orchestrated and timely. And I'm proud of how our teams are coming together to find creative, impactful solutions. We are thoughtfully and aggressively navigating the path forward as we focus on serving our customers, optimizing our cost structure, and protecting cash flow as we position the business to achieve its long-term potential. These environments present as many opportunities as there are challenges, and we are squarely focused on both. Thank you, and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.
Patrick D. Hallinan: Thank you, Chris and greetings to everyone on the call today. I am going to devote the majority of my prepared remarks to discussing how we are approaching the current environment. Before I do, I just want to reiterate that we are encouraged by the progress we achieved in the first quarter, marked by organic revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and continued advancement towards our strategic financial objectives. Now, turning to the balance of the year. As is well covered at this point in the earnings cycle, many companies are navigating the uncertainty stemming from rapidly evolving trade policies. In response, Stanley Black & Decker intends to remain nimble and strive to counter the effect of tariffs with measures within our control, such as supply chain adjustments and price. We will leverage the internal team we assembled during 2024 to enable our organization to address tariffs while keeping our strategic objectives in focus. Our teams have conducted extensive internal planning to prepare for a range of scenarios during 2025 and beyond, and to facilitate our response. Today, we'll present the scenario against which we are executing. To note, we are not macro forecasters and we have not endeavored to formulate a holistic macro forecast or call a U.S. recession, though our scenario planning does contemplate a continuation of the persistently soft DIY landscape and considers tactical adjustments retailers may make as they navigate tariffs. We believe we are prepared to adapt to changes in the economy and in our end markets if such events come to pass. Our planning assumptions incorporate the current in effect policy as of April 29th, which includes 145% incremental tariffs on China, 25% on non-USMCA compliant goods from Mexico, 10% for the rest of the world, and the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum. Our commercial and operational mitigation strategies, we believe are designed to protect both cash generation and margins in response to the anticipated approximately 1.7 billion of estimated gross annualized tariffs. To be clear, this amount is not what we expect to hit our P&L this year or even next year after taking into account cost mitigation and price. We estimate the 2025 net earnings per share headwind after supply chain adjustments and price increases to be $0.75. The impact to 2025 is primarily due to the time required to activate pricing with our customers and the P&L costs of tariffs, the timing of which is impacted by inventory accounting. Our ultimate goal is to strive to mitigate fully headwinds. Since supply chain adjustments require time to implement, pricing actions are the quickest counter measure at our disposal. In addition to supply chain and price actions, we anticipate capturing cost savings in the core business from the final phase of our transformation, plus incremental SG&A cost containment. Our intent is to protect growth investments that we believe will drive long-term share gains and generate positive returns. By remaining agile and pulling levers primarily within our control, we remain focused on delivering our long term margin journey. Turning to our planning assumptions for 2025. We entered this period in a relatively stable demand environment characterized by consistent pro demand and DIY softness and with aggregate U.S. tools and outdoor customer inventory levels consistent with historic norms. It is of paramount importance to uphold our service levels to customers while we take the necessary actions we've discussed to protect the business as the trade environment evolves. Our 2025 GAAP earnings per share planning scenario is $3.30 plus or minus $0.15 which translates to adjusted earnings per share of approximately $4.50. Full year GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from 195 million to 260 million. Adjusted earnings per share within our current planning assumption is $0.75 lower compared to the February pre-tariff view. The main factor is the aforementioned net headwinds from tariffs. Additionally, the negative impact from volume is fully offset by incremental SG&A cost containment, favorable currency, and a modest benefit to below the line items. We are managing capital spending and working capital to be responsive to the underlying environment with a plan for free cash flow to meet or exceed $500 million assuming the operational characteristics of this planning framework. In our planning scenario, total company sales is forecasted to increase low single digits and organic revenue growth is planned for low to mid single digit expansion driven by an assumption for mid-single-digit price, which is partially offset by a low single digit decline in volume. Currency and the infrastructure business divestiture combined are expected to be a low single digit headwind to sales versus the prior year. When looking at the segment level, global tools and outdoor organic revenue is forecasted to expand low to mid-single-digits now driven by price rather than volume. Note, U.S. Tools and Outdoor carries the greatest magnitude of price and volume tariff impacts from mid second quarter through December. And therefore the percentage magnitude of price and volume impacts within the U.S. business is expected to be greater than that for the overall segment during the second half. Engineered Fastening is expected to contribute low single-digit organic revenue growth. We believe these are prudent assumptions, taking into account the impact of higher interest rates on housing and the soft DIY consumer, our price increases and the potential short-term tactical decisions that customers may make as they respond to tariffs. To help those who want to model volume or cost sensitivities against our playing assumptions, we have provided additional context. It is our expectation that a 1 percentage point change in U.S. volume would result in roughly a $0.13 impact to adjusted earnings per share. This assumption contains decrementals to 20% to 25% with cost control or similar incremental net of growth investment. Our intent is to contain the profit downside to these levels, depending on the magnitude of any volume shifts. In the event of tariff reductions, the benefit would be from the release date through the duration period when these mitigations are assumed to be an impact. Regarding our cost savings strategy, we anticipate achieving $500 million in supply chain cost savings in 2025, in addition to an assumption for savings from tariff mitigation actions. Additionally, we are striving to reduce SG&A, while protecting the priority growth investments contemplated in our 2025 plan. Under these assumptions, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA margin rate to expand year-over-year. As it relates to the second quarter, we are planning for flat to low single-digit organic revenue decline and an expectation for positive adjusted pretax earnings. The second quarter will carry a heavy tariff burden due to LIFO. In an environment characterized by reduced visibility and frequent changes, our top priorities are unchanged. We are committed to advancing towards our long-term strategic and financial goals and do not believe policy changes impact our ability to achieve those over time. Our effort to successfully finish the supply chain transformation in 2025 is pivotal in supporting gross margins and we are now pivoting to growth and striving to accelerate the company's share gain capabilities. Finally, robust cash conversion and strengthening our balance sheet remain top priorities as we work to achieve our multiyear deleveraging goal. While tariffs present a considerable challenge in the near term, they do not detract from our long-term shareholder value creation opportunity. We believe we are making the right adjustments to the company that are strategically designed to position us for sustained long-term growth, margin expansion, and value creation. With that, I will now return the call to Don.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Thank you, Pat. As you heard this morning, we are committed to continuing to make meaningful progress across our top priorities. Accelerating our growth culture to serve our end users and customers, generating cash and strengthening our balance sheet, and progressing the transformation to support our long-term margin journey. While we don't know the ultimate trade policy outcome, by thoughtfully preparing and being pragmatic in our decision-making, we believe we can successfully manage through the changing environment. We believe the actions we are taking today are positioning the company to deliver sustainable long-term shareholder returns. We are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis M. Lange: Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Sprague: Hey, thank you. Good morning. Hey Don, Chris, a little surprising actually, fairly surprising that Mexico is only one third USMCA compliant. I wonder if you could kind of go through why that is, how quickly you can rectify that, and the rest of world tariffs at 10% seems a little low relative to my quick check, but maybe you could touch on that also why you only have 10% on that other bucket?
Donald Allan, Jr.: Okay. So, good morning Jeff, and I'll let Chris take the first part. And Pat, you want to take the second part.
Christopher J. Nelson: Good morning Jeff. So as far as USMCA compliance, as we stated in the call, we're a little bit below one third right now. And what I'd say is that as we transitioned from the original NAFTA to USMCA, there were nuances in qualification that at the time, weren't worth the cost-benefit trade-off. They're fairly straightforward, and we're operationalizing plans to get a much higher percentage of those revenues or imports USMCA qualified. So it's an ongoing project. It's not overly operationally complex to complete.
Patrick D. Hallinan: Yes, Jeff, and on the other, what I'd say is what we try to do in the planning assumption for the balance of the year is kind of stick with the policy as we know it today instead of making a bunch of different permutations on policy. And right now, for us the rest of world, which is about $1.5 billion-ish of U.S. COGS is predominantly four Southeast Asian countries make up about 75% of that $1.5 billion. And right now, the tariff rate on those specific countries and all the others in that bucket is 10%. So we're kind of just sticking with existing policy. Obviously, policy may shift and as it does, we'll shift some of our priorities at merited. But right now, that's the current policy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open.
Timothy Wojs: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for all the details. I guess my question, just as you think about the $1.7 billion of gross kind of tariff impacts. How would you bucket what you expect to kind of offset with price, SG&A cost reductions, and then facility moves, and I guess, how did you think about kind of that low single-digit kind of volume decline from a demand kind of sensitivity or elasticity perspective?
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yes, Tim. So what I would say is there's a near term and then there's the long term. I'd say, for 2025, we're expecting tariff expense in 2025 to hit our P&L kind of in the $1 billion-ish plus or minus $100 million. And the near-term mitigation just with the magnitude and the pace at which things have come at us, the near-term mitigation is dominated by price and price will make up the majority of the mitigation. As our script and the deck that came out with it, there's about $140 million delta between the tariff expense this year and the netted amount, and that $140 million is the $0.75. In terms of how we expect to offset the volume hit, that's going to be mostly through SG&A expense management. We're going to have incremental SG&A expense management that it's probably in the $125 million, plus or minus $25 million this year. As we go forward from this year, obviously, be working to drive the tariff expense out of our P&L to the greatest extent possible as quickly as possible with supply chain moves. And we think we can get away from COGS -- China COGS for the U.S., mostly most of that done within about two years' time. In terms of volume, as you mentioned, the planning assumption does have a full year enterprise-wide volume hit that's a little bit more than 2% or around U.S. $400 million, which might sound like, but that's a full year global volume. When you put that in the U.S., that's 4% plus, kind of 4% to 5%, probably closer to 4% for the full year in the U.S., but on a back half basis, you're getting to high single-digit volume hit in the U.S. And what I would tell you is, I'm not quite sure we have a model that tells us with precision elasticity under these circumstances. What we tried to bake in was some of the early year DIY softness we've seen and an expectation that under the current circumstances, that's going to continue. Anticipate a little bit of the weight of a higher 10-year treasury bond on the U.S. housing market. And then some of the disruption that's certain to arise as retailers decide in these very early days, how to navigate tariffs and whether to take full shipments of China goods right now. And so that's really what that volume assumes, it's pretty considerable volume. But I wouldn't peg it to a precise elasticity model or a strong form macro conclusion that presumes a recession.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to home in a little bit on the sort of the phasing through the year, I suppose, of that $140 million net headwind from tariffs that you just mentioned that dialed into the guide. How does that differ maybe from the phasing of that $1 billion gross headwind in the P&L? And maybe, Pat, sort of allied to that, from the outside, it's a little bit confusing of sort of the flows of LIFO accounting plus the fact you had a lot of low-cost inventory pre the tariff hikes. So kind of how are those playing out and what does that mean for your free cash flow phasing, I think you're guiding for about $1 billion of free cash generation in Q2 to Q4 this year? Thank you.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yes, Julian, there's definitely going to be some unusual pressure to the second and the third quarter, in particular, the second quarter. I think, again, we're going to be focused on serving our customers and our customers are navigating this in real time as well. But as best we can tell, we do expect some shipment softness in the back part of the second quarter. And we do expect because of LIFO accounting, a pretty heavy tariff expense burden in the P&L in the second quarter. And so our likely our second quarter on a pretax operating earnings basis is probably positive, but only slightly so. And that would be our expectation. As we go through the year, even in a normal year, our cash flow is heavily weighted towards the latter third of the year, and I expect that to be roughly the same just in the sense that, that will be about the point in time when price increases fully catch up the tariff expense. What will be happening in a cash flow perspective, is by about mid-May, plus or minus a couple of weeks, we'll be at kind of the full monthly cash expense of those tariffs to kind of monthly run rate of that $1.7 billion will be fully upon us by about mid-May. And pricing in total anticipated to be fully in place by the early part of the third quarter. So from a cash flow perspective, it probably takes us until the early days of the third quarter to have pricing matching tariff expense. But I would expect that the back part of the year, in particular the fourth quarter to be from this point forward in the year, the strongest EPS in cash quarter by far.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Joseph Ritchie: Hey, good morning guys. So you mentioned putting through high single-digit pricing increases at this point with your retail partners. The math implies that you need roughly, call it, $850 million or so in pricing for the year just to offset and get to that net tariff impact. So how much -- what is high single digit to your retail partners, how much pricing has actually come through? And then maybe just give us a little bit more color on how those conversations are going and your confidence in your ability to get the additional pricing as we progress through the year?
Christopher J. Nelson: Hey Joe, this is Chris. So I'll start with the first price increase, which, as we mentioned is live and is in -- it's showing up on the shelves as we speak. And that was and across the board, high single-digit price increase and would be expected to be that way for the balance of the year, obviously. So that's going to completely flow through. But as I would transition to the second part of the conversation, which is what next is that I think it's important to take a step back and understand that this is -- the -- as Pat mentioned, the speed and magnitude of the change is based on trade policy makes pricing something that we have to do out of the gate. As we look at the industry dynamics, certainly, it's not -- we're not alone. And actually, as we take a look at our current footprint and our 60% of our volume being North America based and only 15% coming from China with the highest tariff burdens, we feel that we are in an advantaged position, and we will continue to extend that advantage as we further mitigate. Along those lines, we're in the early stages of conversations with our customers. And our collective goal is to make sure that we work together to have an optimal selection for our end users through this whole thing. And given the flexibility and footprint that we have right now, we feel that we're in a very good position to do that with the lowest tariff burden possible. So we're working not only on kind of the ways that we can set up our selection for our customers, the ways that we can mitigate effectively and quickly, but then also keeping an eye on what we need to do for our end users and as Pat said, being judicious about the long term. Our retailers understand that this has been something that has taken all of us by storm, if you will, with the speed of it. And we're working certainly with them hand-in-hand and want to make sure that we collectively in front of us, keep the end user and the purchaser of those products in front of us to make sure that they have what they need for their applications because this is -- at the end of the day, it is part of the beauty of this business and why it's such a great business. We serve great markets, and we know that our end users need those products for the applications that they execute every day, and we're going to be there with them with our channel partners to make sure that, that is the case.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of numbers here, and I obviously appreciate all the detail and the thoughtfulness. Just wanted to clarify a couple of points, I guess. If I have the math right, the second price increase would be something in the order of another mid-single-digit price increase to North America tools. Just wanted to make sure that I'm thinking about that right in order to get to the $850 million of price offset for the year? And secondly, with the guidance for 2Q being positive pretax earnings, I assume given the fact that you're not giving a number and obviously a bigger hit in the second quarter, we should be thinking about 2Q EPS being minimally positive if that's fair to say?
Christopher J. Nelson: So this is Chris. I'll start with the pricing question and then turn it over to Pat. First and foremost, we don't have nor would it be appropriate for us to talk about the actual price increase for Q3 that we referenced. First, because we're still working through that with our customers as we referenced. We want to make sure that we work very closely with them to make sure that we have the proper assortment. We understand what mitigation and what we're going to be able to fulfill for our end users. So there is no price increase that we've arrived at right now. The timing that you referenced is correct. But I would just for point of view, say, it's likely higher than the first price increase that we went out with.
Patrick D. Hallinan: In terms of second quarter, Mike, I think you're right. It's going to be positive, but minimally so on both pretax and after-tax earnings basis.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe: Oh, thanks. Good morning. So Pat, I think I just want to respond to the intricacies of this LIFO charge in 2Q. Is it because your LIFO and therefore, you have to basically mark-to-market the inventory on hand pre-tariffs to the tariff cost coming through the cash flow in 2Q. So that's a onetime noncash charge because of the LIFO accounting. And then just my real question is, when you think about the USMCA compliance, I think we all expected it to be quite low because of the sourcing of batteries and Powertronics, which largely resides today in China. So I'm just curious, how do you pivot away from China given the importance of those components to your power tool franchise?
Patrick D. Hallinan: Hey Nigel, I'll start with LIFO, and I'll try not to take us all down a rat hole because our financials actually have both FIFO and LIFO just to keep everyone on their toes. But in the simple term, tariffs are an incremental unfavorable variance to standard cost of goods sold. And the way our LIFO works is every time we have a new variable that affects our cost structure, we have to anticipate that variance for the full year across the volumes we expect to buy or make for the full year. And then that total variance rolls off the balance sheet according to inventory turns. And so what's ended up happening in the second quarter is you have a balance of the year total variance for think of it as about 10 months of the year. LIFO variants that will roll off according to inventory turns and the LIFO portion of it just kind of disproportionately hits the first quarter or the second quarter, rather. And so that's the simple accounting of it is that $1.7 billion is going into basically a COGS variance.
Christopher J. Nelson: Nigel, this is Chris. Thanks for the question. And I think certainly, as you pointed out, the dynamic that you expressed on the -- especially the battery is the operative question. And therefore, USMCA compliance is more of an issue that we've got to sort through on the power tools side. And what I would say is that we are -- we will continue to look at options for us in how we import, how we package and how we marry that battery with the tool and the shipping dynamics and then the importing dynamics to make sure that we are fully USMCA compliant and maintain our technology advantage that we have on our battery tool combinations.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Christopher Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask about customer inventory levels and specifically at some of the big retailers. And it sounds like from the commentary that you guys view those as largely normalized but the guide does include some level of destock. So I guess if any kind of color on what's in the guide around potential destock there? And then just how have those conversations gone with retailers. If we look at the January quarter, their inventories were all up across the board. So I guess any view on when you think they could upstart destocking, is that a Q2 risk, is it more of a Q3 risk given there's another price increase coming from you guys in Q3, so any color on that would be appreciated? Thank you.
Patrick D. Hallinan: Chris, this is Pat. I'll start and I don't know if Chris will have anything to add, he can decide after I'm done. When we went into the year, I would say broadly, and almost at every point, inventory levels across our big customers and our customer base in general was quite normal in the scheme of things. I mean we've been in an environment where I'd say they've all for the most part, stayed at the midpoint or low side of their normal range just with the cost of short-term money and the fact that our service levels have recovered. I would say for us relative to our plan and our experience through most of the first quarter, we did have some demand strength in March that might have been associated with tariff pre-buying. But for the most of the first quarter, the DIY customer was soft. And as you heard in my earlier response to the volume question, I'd say of the $400-ish million versus prior year of volume out assumption we have in our planning assumption, probably half of that is just carrying forward some of that soft DIY trend and in anticipation of what the higher tenure will do to the U.S. housing market. I suppose that, that at certain retailers could mean those that have disproportionate DIY volumes, some slight inventory reset. But I'd say that, that would be pretty focused to product lines and retailers. I don't think that's a broad-based dynamic.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Joseph O’Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Probably enough LIFO questions to get you to switch to fully FIFO, but just a clarification on if you could size what that LIFO headwind is to pretax earnings in Q2? And then bigger picture, just when you sized the $1.7 billion annualized gross impact, if you address the strategies that are underway, can you size the opportunity through what you can do on USMCA and getting higher coverage there, what a move of that 15% of China would mean, and so based on those strategies, what that $1.7 billion would be going to?
Patrick D. Hallinan: I'll start on the first one and then maybe ask for some clarification on the second one. On the first one, Joe, I would say the LIFO impact to the second quarter is probably in the $200 million to $250 million range, $100 million, $200 million to $250 million. And really, the dynamic I should have said on the earlier response is you're getting that before you're getting all the price. And that's why it's a more dramatic effect in the second quarter than it is in the third and the fourth quarter. When we talk about USMCA and Chris or Don may add to this, there's a twofold benefit to addressing USMCA compliance, right. As we stated earlier in the call and in the Q&A, we're about one third USMCA compliant from our COGS from the Mexico to the U.S. today. There's the obvious benefit of then reducing the tariff burden from Mexico at 25%. But we have a lot of great assets and capacity in Mexico. And so the extent to which we dual source already products that we can move more of the volume to Mexico or to the extent with some modest equipment moving or capability building in Mexico take volumes that aren't dual source today. So there's a twofold benefit to the USMCA compliance angle, and it would be a big part of us mitigating what we expect to be half or more of the tariff burden over two years.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yeah, thanks. Good morning guys. Just wanted to ask on the SG&A savings plan. Any help with respect to quarterly cadence, like how quickly you can start to take those actions? And I guess if demand weakened if we were to go into more of a recessionary environment as all of this unfolds, do you have more that you could do on the cost side, whether it's COGS or SG&A, you guys have just been focused on costs for some time now? Thank you.
Patrick D. Hallinan: Yes, Nicole, I would say, I would be modeling it roughly flat across the three quarters. The levers will be a little bit different across the three quarters. It will be close to that approximation. I mean, maybe slightly biased to the second half, but I don't think by large amounts. And as our planning assumption and the scenario guidance suggest, I mean, yes, we do have more levers to pull. But as we work through this year and through 2026 and beyond we're going to have a twofold focus. One is preserving the growth investments that we think are critical to building the business and driving growth over the long term and everywhere possible being as efficient in supporting the business in the back part of the enterprise so that we're maximizing the amount we can invest that's customer-facing and then keeping our total expense base sound relative to the volume of the enterprise.
Donald Allan, Jr.: The only thing I would add as it relates to your supply chain question is that as we've been stating all along through the transformation, what we have been concentrating on doing is being more flexible, more efficient, and then also adjusting our footprint to reflect a more focused company. That -- there's a lot more that we will continue to do there. And it's actually what we're doing in the mitigation front is in support of and in line with that. So not only is there more that will support us through this time, but it will ultimately be something that certainly moves us -- will continue moving us along on the journey that we had planned out, and we do feel confident about the ability to continue on towards that 35% plus gross margin journey. It's just that there are some things that we now have to adjust as we prioritize some of the mitigation efforts. But it's not anything that would be counter to that supply chain strategy.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis M. Lange: Thanks, Shannon. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-05 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. 2024 fourth quarter and full year webcast. Here today, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO, Christopher Nelson, COO, EVP, and President of Tools and Outdoor, and Patrick Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning, Don, Chris, and Pat will review our 2024 fourth quarter and full year results, and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcasts, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-Ks that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing. Additionally, we may also reference non-GAAP financial measures during the call. For applicable reconciliations to the related GAAP financial measure and additional information, please refer to the appendix of the supplemental presentation and the corresponding press release, which are available on our website under the IR section. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.
Don Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. I know many of you are ready to dig into 2025. But it's important to first mark the significant progress we achieved in 2024. We successfully advanced each of our key focus areas during 2024, by delivering continued gross margin expansion, solid free cash flow generation, and a stronger balance sheet. All while making new investments aimed at driving sustainable market share growth. The progress we achieved was notable in the face of a mixed macroeconomic backdrop. And is a testament to our team's relentless pursuit of our vision created two and a half years ago. Together, the leadership team and I are revitalizing the organization to be centered around our brands, and end users. And we are reshaping the cost structure to be more efficient in the back office processes, while investing in areas close to our end users, and channel customers, to drive sustainable share gain. The positive impact on our performance thus far is clear. In 2024, we overcame a soft consumer and DIY environment. To deliver full year revenues of $15.4 billion which was flat on an organic basis versus many markets retracted. Especially in the back half of the year. We are encouraged by the growth and share gain progression in DEWALT. Which grew mid-single digits organically in 2024. A sign that our investments and focus are translating into positive top-line momentum. Additionally, standout organic growth of 22% in aerospace fastening also contributed to our overall revenue results. As we completed year two of our transformational journey, we are proud to have delivered on key financial milestones. Including adjusted gross margin greater than 31% in the fourth quarter, and 30% for the full year. The full year margin expansion of 400 basis points primarily driven by our reshaped supply chain and ongoing strategic initiatives. We see more opportunity ahead as we work to complete our transformational cost savings program in 2025. And push to our long-term target of greater than 35% adjusted gross margin. This significant progress related to stabilizing revenue and executing our cost transformational program while making ongoing growth investments, resulted in full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion with a margin of 10.1%. Which is an expansion of 290 basis points as compared to 2023. This EBITDA outcome translated into full year adjusted earnings per share, of $4.36 demonstrating significant growth over 2023 EPS. Earnings growth and working capital efficiency improvements both contributed to free cash flow of approximately $750 million. This strong free cash flow generation plus the proceeds from our infrastructure business divestiture supported $1.1 billion of debt reduction in 2024, and solid progress towards achieving our leverage target. Our strong execution in 2024 was the result of organizational alignment and focus. Which helped us meet or exceed our goals. I want to thank our organization for the relentless focus and dedication to world-class service of our end users and channel customers, while achieving these financial results. Our 2024 performance in combination with the activation of our growth culture across the company, is setting a strong foundation for the next chapter of growth for Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. We are targeting over the mid-term top-line organic growth of mid-single digits in a low single-digit market. With adjusted gross margin of 35% plus. We believe that by continuing to advance against these measures, it will contribute to successfully achieving the adjusted EBITDA target of $2.5 billion that we shared at our recent Capital Markets Day. Now turning to performance in the fourth quarter. We delivered $3.7 billion of revenue, flat versus prior year, comprised of a solid 3% organic revenue growth which was offset by a 2-point impact from the infrastructure business divestiture and a point of currency headwind. Our adjusted gross margin was 31.2%, up 140 basis points versus the fourth quarter of last year, mainly due to our global cost reduction program. These revenue and gross margin outcomes net of our continued funding of growth investments designed to deliver future sustainable market share gains, resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.2%. Which is up 80 basis points versus the prior year. This fourth quarter EBITDA result translated into adjusted earnings per share of $1.49 for the quarter. Our free cash flow was $565 million in the fourth quarter, an outstanding performance that continues to support our ongoing capital allocation priorities. Namely organic investments, shareholder dividends, and debt reduction. Due to this weekend's announcement and ongoing shifts over the last two days, we decided to provide you our base case view for 2025. Which excludes impacts of any tariffs, and demonstrates our underlying earnings power. In addition, to help you size what we may have to navigate related to tariffs, we will provide cost of goods sold information based on country of origin for our US businesses, which will allow all of you to correlate with the proposed policy the president announced over the weekend or how it evolves over the coming days or weeks. This is a dynamic environment. But as we shared with you last year, we have developed a plan that we are deploying with speed. We believe we can mitigate tariffs with supply chain repositioning and price. But do not believe it is something that will throw us off our long-term growth and EBITDA aspirations. We've successfully navigated this before. And have a new seasoned management team in place to enable success once again. Our goal is to ensure that as the president and his administration work to accelerate growth in the United States, and negotiate better trade deals, with our country's major trading partners we are positioned for success as the only significant US-based manufacturer in our industry. We continue to engage with the president and his new administration to support them in achieving their goals in these areas, while we navigate the next several months to minimize the impact to Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. As we exit 2025. The base case pre-tariff planning assumption for 2025 is adjusted EPS of $5.25 plus or minus $0.50. With $650 to $850 million of free cash flow. During our October earnings call, we were among the first to describe the demand environment as softer likely longer. With an expectation that the first half of 2025 would likely remain choppy or sluggish. Three months later, we have seen little evidence to change that view. And given the indicators that we do see, several end markets may not improve until 2026. Interest rate cuts in 2024 have had very little impact as mortgages continue to be well above 6%. Therefore, as we think about our base case operating environment, our current perspective on the market outlook assumes that aggregated market demand is stable and expected to be relatively flat year over year. We believe this is consistent with how we exited 2024, and this underpins the midpoint of our base case earnings per share range. In the back half of 2024, we delivered a 0.5 point of organic growth. Our plan in the first half of 2025 and the full year assumes modestly stronger organic growth. We expect price, and our company-specific opportunities such as our continued investment behind our core brands of DEWALT, Stanley, and Craftsman to serve our end users. Combined with targeted market activation initiatives to drive low single-digit organic growth. We believe there is potential for a market-driven positive inflection to occur later in 2025. But this is not reflected in our midpoint base case. Stepping back from the short-term horizon, the long-term market trends are very attractive and the outlook for our industries remains incredibly positive. There is a large and growing gap in the North American residential housing inventory. Which supports the need for increased in housing starts. In addition, existing home turnover remains at cyclically depressed levels. In fact, existing home sales in 2024 fell to their lowest level since 1995. Which just magnifies this point. And with the average age of a US house at roughly 40 years old, we believe homeowners will reengage in an increased level of repair and renovation once interest rates decline to lower levels. As construction activity accelerates over the long term, the tradespeople that we serve will benefit. And they will need our tools to help get the job done. We serve labor-constrained industries. And our innovations are designed to deliver enhanced productivity with significant safety features. We are prudently investing across our portfolio to fuel end-user inspired innovation, and differentiated market activation designed to capture the share gain opportunities we anticipate in the near term, and over the long-term horizon. We are funding new growth investments in the relatively healthy markets such as DEWALT Professional Tools, to build upon its seventh consecutive quarter of growth. And market share gain. While continuously striving for excellence, with how we serve our end users, and channel customers, In engineered fastening, we expect growth to again be led by aerospace. With OEM monthly build rates expected to step up year over year. 2025 projections for global industrial production are flat to positive and the automotive outlook continues to be pressured. In summary, we do believe we can deliver organic revenue growth in 2025 through price increases, and share gain in markets that will likely be relatively flat aggregate. We are committed to continued long-term margin expansion, driven by our supply chain transformation plan, Pat will share more detail on this in a moment, as well as contextualize our planning framework and tariffs. I want to thank our team members again for their dedication, a successful 2024. We remain committed to accelerating our growth culture with operational excellence at its core to position the company for sustainable success. I'm confident that we are equipped with the talent and experience to navigate whatever comes our way in 2025 and beyond. I will now pass it to Christopher Nelson, to review the business segment performance. Chris?
Christopher Nelson: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. First, turning to the tools and outdoor operating performance. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $3.2 billion driven by 3% organic revenue growth versus prior year. DEWALT delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth which was complemented by a solid holiday season. These two positive drivers were partially offset by the weak consumer and DIY backdrop. Fourth quarter adjusted segment margin was 10.2%, a 20 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter 2023. We continue to leverage the supply chain transformation savings to deliver margin expansion while funding incremental growth investments. Growth was broad-based across the segment, and all of our tools and outdoor product lines grew organically in the fourth quarter. Organic growth for power tools was 5% in the quarter, with new innovations, pro-driven momentum, and solid promotional activity offset by pressure from the soft DIY demand backdrop. Hand tools grew 2% organically. This performance was supported by new product listings, notably DEWALT TUFF System 2.0 DXC modular workstation. Which provides pros a solution that can be customized for optimal user productivity. Outdoor posted 3% organic growth in the quarter. Supported by positive performance from the independent dealer channel, as well as continued momentum with handheld battery offerings. We believe that our customers have right-sized inventory levels exiting 2024 which should set up shipments to match demand in 2025. Turning to Tools and Outdoor fourth quarter performance by region, North America was up 2% organically with a solid holiday season. Organic growth in Europe was 4%, with positive contributions from most regions supported by investments in growth initiatives. Including the expansion of our professional product offerings and local and focused marketing activation. Rest of world grew 8% organically. This was driven by high single-digit growth in Latin America, led by Brazil, along with mid-single-digit growth in India. Overall, we are pleased with the segment's fourth quarter top-line performance, a strong end to a back half that delivered a half a point of organic growth with markets that continue to show more signs of stability. On a full-year basis, we delivered slightly positive organic growth, DEWALT led the way and posted solid mid-single-digit growth for the year. Which we estimate to be ahead of the market representing share gain. Our success was underpinned by innovation with new product launches, such as power shift, the construction jack, and our new TUFF system. Additionally, with our supply chain improvements, we are focused on continuing to improve execution and service levels with our customers. This opens new opportunities for increased listings and placement for our powerful brands in stores. Full-year adjusted segment margin expanded by 350 basis points to 10.1%, which is a substantial improvement versus prior year primarily driven by the supply chain transformation initiative. Now moving to industrial. Fourth quarter revenue declined 15% on a reported basis versus the prior year. Which was nearly all attributable to the infrastructure business divestiture. Organic revenue was flat with two points of price offset by a two-point volume decline due to automotive market softness. The automotive business experienced a high single-digit organic decline. As OEMs reduced light vehicle production schedules and tightened capex spending. The aerospace business posted organic growth in the mid-teens, supported by new content wins and a strong booking rate. Industrial fasteners organic growth was up high single digits. The industrial adjusted segment margin rate was 10.7% in the quarter, a moderate contraction versus prior year, due to the impact of automotive market softness on volumes. For the full year, we delivered 2% organic growth in Engineered Fastening, Total industrial adjusted segment margin expanded 70 basis points to 12.5%. This margin expansion was driven by the price realization and cost productivity we generated throughout the year. I would like to acknowledge both the tools and outdoor and industrial teams for their focused efforts and solid execution in 2024. Against a mixed macroeconomic backdrop. And thank the teams for positioning us well as we work through the final innings of the transformation. Moving to the next slide. I'd like to share more about how we are operationalizing our strategy of thoughtfully and aggressively prioritizing resources to accelerate growth in tools and outdoor. Our brand-centered teams studied the category trends in the marketplace to prioritize investments in the fastest-growing user segment. We continue to cultivate deep connections with those end users to gain a well-informed understanding of unique trade and application-based needs. Which helps us to prioritize the most impactful innovations in our robust product and technology pipeline. At the same time, our centralized engineering organization is focused on standardizing innovation processes and implementing a platform approach to design. With the eye towards improving our speed, cost, and effectiveness. As we shared at our Capital Markets Day, we believe platforming can be a major unlock as we leverage the benefit of common components to reduce complex traditional strength of purpose-built innovation. The result is innovative new products developed with speed and at the best cost. Solutions that address specific challenges of the priority trade groups. We have multiple examples of this, but today, I'm going to highlight carpentry. For the last century, and still today, sweat equity has been at the core of our respect for the carpentry trade. Our DEWALT Carpentry Total Solutions offer tools that can keep pros productive in every phase of a job with confidence in every application. With that in mind, we are developing end-to-end solutions to deliver a best-in-class user experience with features to make carpenters as efficient and effective as possible. We provide tailored solutions for demanding applications. From framing to building and installing, custom cabinetry. To molding trim for baseboards, windows, and doors, A few new powerful additions to highlight from the expanded lineup of next-generation 20-volt MaxxR tools include the three-speed hammer drill, This is our most powerful 20-volt max hammer drill. Which is equipped with the anti-rotation system a Performant Protect safety feature that shuts the tool down if rotational motion is excessive. We've also highlighted our new quarter-inch quiet hydraulic impact driver. This is the industry's highest-rated max torque hydraulic impact driver. It features quieter operation for volume-sensitive environments and an advanced hydraulic mechanism for consistent performance in tight or tough conditions. We believe concentrating investments behind our core brands and priority trade groups will help us to deliver consistent profitable share gain in an attractive and growing market. We expect our efforts to again outperform the market this year. We have what it takes to win and are moving with a sense of urgency to accelerate our organic growth trajectory to step up and consistently deliver 200 to 300 basis points of growth above the market over the midterm. Thank you very much, and I'll now pass the call over to Patrick Hallinan.
Patrick Hallinan: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. As you've heard from us throughout this past year, we made meaningful progress on our transformation journey in 2024. I will now highlight the financial accomplishments achieved during the fourth quarter and then detail how we plan to continue towards our cost savings and margin targets to complete our strategic transformation and pivot to accelerated growth, and continual margin expansion. In the fourth quarter, we achieved approximately $110 million of pre-tax run rate cost savings. For 2024 in total, we generated approximately $500 million of pretax run rate cost savings. This result is in line with the framework we set both at the outset of the transformation, and in the beginning of the year, despite continued volume headwinds. This brings our aggregate savings to approximately $1.5 billion since the program's inception. Of the $1.5 billion, approximately $1 billion has come from the supply chain transformation with material productivity, and operations excellence driving approximately 75% of these savings captured to date. Our 2024 and program to date performance demonstrates strong execution by our team. We've achieved sequential adjusted gross margin improvement over each half-year period for the last two years. I would like to commend my colleagues across the organization for diligently continuing to pursue the cost reduction goals of our transformation. We continue to target $2 billion of pretax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025, as we complete the transformation. Of the $2 billion, we expect $1.5 billion to be delivered through our four core supply chain transformation initiatives of material productivity, operations excellence, footprint action, and complexity reduction. We are activating a robust pipeline of savings initiatives to support our expected gross margin expansion momentum. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our target of 35% plus adjusted gross margin. Moving to the next slide. We had a strong finish to the year as we continue to make progress on two of our most important focus areas, cash generation and gross margin expansion. We generated $565 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, bringing 2024 free cash flow generation to just over $750 million which was near the top end of our initial 2024 guidance range of $600 to $800 million. Our solid operational performance along with the proceeds from the infrastructure divestiture helped fund our dividend and reduced debt by $1.1 billion. Drivers of 2024 free cash flow were year-over-year growth in cash earnings, driven by operational improvement along with over $300 million of working capital benefit. Before year-end, we made the strategic decision to invest in roughly $200 million of strategic inventory to buffer the potential impact of changes to the operating environment. Overall, it is encouraging to see higher earnings as a result of operational improvements become a predominant driver of free cash flow. As these profitability enhancements are sustainable to our future free cash flow. Regarding capital allocation, in the near and medium term, our priorities are to fund the transformation and our acceleration of organic growth to support our long-standing dividend and to reduce debt. We remain committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating. In 2025, we plan to further reduce debt working towards our target leverage metric of approximately at or below 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We expect to achieve this objective over the next twelve to eighteen months depending on the timing of modest portfolio pruning actions which we expect to generate greater than $500 million of proceeds. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin was 31.2% in the fourth quarter, a 140 basis point improvement versus prior year, primarily driven by savings from the supply chain transformation net of freight inflation, as well as normal wage and benefit inflation. With our performance this quarter, we achieved our long-held interim transformation goal of 30% adjusted gross margin in 2024. Given the dynamic nature currently surrounding tariff policies, we believe it is prudent to provide our 2025 planning assumptions today. Excluding the impact of new tariffs. Additionally, we have provided a view of our enterprise-wide US cost of goods sold by country of origin. Regarding tariffs, ultimately, we expect to mitigate the impact of potential scenarios through a combination of supply chain and price adjustments. I will now walk you through the 2025 planning assumptions for our company which exclude the impact of potential tariffs, I will then conclude by sharing our general approach to potential tariff mitigation. The 2025 pre-tariff base case implies a full-year GAAP earnings per share midpoint of $4.05 plus or minus $0.65. As well as adjusted earnings per share midpoint of $5.25 plus or minus $0.50. Our pre-tariff, free cash flow base is $750 million plus or minus $100 million. With the midpoint in a similar zone to 2024 led by operational earnings expansion. We will continue to prioritize inventory effectiveness in 2025 with the plan to reduce total working capital by $250 to $350 million. This includes persisting roughly $150 million of targeted inventory investments to facilitate an acceleration of supply chain changes to reduce US exposure to China production. Our 2025 outlook for capital expenditures is $350 to $400 million approximately 2.5% on sale. We expect first-quarter free cash flow to be an outflow consistent with typical historic working capital trend. This base case called for earning expansion in 2025 through organic growth from modest share gains and price increases in response to currency headwinds combined with supply chain cost structure improvement, that are primarily in our control. We are planning for the first half of 2025 aggregate market demand to remain muted at relatively stable levels compared to the second half of 2024, with the potential for a positive inflection later in the year. At our midpoint, we are expecting approximately 1% to 2% organic growth in the front half compared to approximately half a point of growth in the second half of 2024. This assumes modest share gain and easier comps against 2024 channel inventory reduction. The back half is expected to be modestly stronger supported in part by the price increases we are implementing in response to currency. The underlying demand assumptions are for a continuation of relative strength for professional tools as well as aerospace and industrial fastening, This is accompanied by an expectation for the presently soft automotive consumer and DIY demand trends to persist with the potential to inflect positive in the middle of 2025. These assumptions underpin our full-year plan for total company reported revenue to be relatively flat year over year with organic revenue growth roughly offsetting headwinds from currency and the final quarter of the infrastructure divestiture. Organic revenue growth is planned to be up just over 2% at the midpoint. Outpacing the overall market supported by targeted share gains in our businesses and modest pricing to offset currency pressure. Our planning range contemplates plus or minus 150 basis points of volume growth with the variances driven by market demand. Tools and outdoor organic revenue growth is expected to be in the low single digits at the midpoint. Supported by the same organic factors as the total company. Volume growth will be fueled by strategic investments focused on our core brands and directed towards ProLED, and industry-leading innovation, as well as local and focused market activation with additional field resources and targeted marketing initiatives. Industrial organic revenue is expected to be in the low single digits primarily driven by an aerospace market recovery, as well as market outperformance in industrial fasteners, driven by investments in end-market penetration. The automotive outlook which is tied to light vehicle production, is muted and as such, we are planning for this business to be negative in 2025 while prioritizing regions with share gain opportunities. From a reporting perspective, in 2025, we are shifting a small storage business from industrial into the tools and outdoor segment. We will disclose the impact of this change on a quarterly basis and it will not be included in either segment's reported organic growth. Our transformation program will be a positive contributor to adjusted gross margin again in 2025. And we will invest a portion of those savings for long-term organic growth and share gain. This year, we plan to invest an incremental $100 million to further advance our robust innovation pipeline and fuel market activation aimed to improve brand health and accelerate organic growth. Our planning expectation is that SG and A as a percentage of sales and 2025 remains around 22%. We will manage SG and A thoughtfully with the intent to preserve the investments designed to position the business for long-term growth. Turning to profitability, we expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to improve for the full year supported by top-line expansion and the benefits of the supply chain transformation program, with a neutral input cost outlook for 2025. Currency represents a $100 million headwind to profit based on the midpoint of January rates. A subset of this, approximately $40 million, is a transactional headwind to gross margin and is expected to be fully covered by price this year. We are implementing price with speed, but expect a slight net headwind in the front half of 2025. Segment margin in Tools and Outdoor is planned to be up year over year also driven by low single-digit growth and continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The industrial segment is expected to decline versus prior year as volume growth and operating improvement are offset by the mix pressures from automotive. Turning to other 2025 pre-tariff assumptions. GAAP earnings include pretax non-GAAP adjustments, ranging from $195 to $260 million largely related to the supply chain transformation program. With approximately 25% expected to be noncash footprint rationalization call. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to step up in 2025 to 15% with the first two quarters consistent with the first half rate experienced last year, at around 30%. Other 2025 modeling assumptions are noted on the slide. We expect the first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 12% to 13% of the $5.25 planning assumption underpinned by total company organic sales growth, that is expected to be low single digits. The range around the quarter is likely greater than normal given potential tariffs might change first-quarter ordering behavior. The EPS in the quarter is impacted by the tax profile discussed earlier. Adjusted first-quarter EBITDA is expected to be roughly 20% of our full-year expectation in this planning assumption, relatively consistent with pre-pandemic history. Which brings me to the impacts that are possible if tariffs are enacted and persist. We previously disclosed tools and outdoor US manufacturing footprint details in late 2024. We have updated this disclosure to reference US COGS for the entire company and share the latest information based on US trade-defined country of origin. Our latest view of China is lower, at $900 million to $1 billion of imports into the United States. And we continue to work to reduce this exposure. Our approach to any tariff scenario will be to offset the impacts with a mix of supply chain and pricing action. Which might lag the formalization of tariffs by two to three months therefore limiting P and L headwinds in the near term and maintaining our long-term margin objective. If the current addition of 10% tariffs on China remains in place, we would expect an annualized unmitigated impact of approximately $90 to $100 million based on how we would react this would result in a 2025 net impact of $10 to $20 million accounting for the time needed to deploy countermeasures. We expect the current situation to remain dynamic. We expect to await greater clarity before enacting any new measures beyond the work of accelerating US COGS out of China, which was underway and was accelerated during the second half of 2024. In summary, 2025 represents the final step along our transformation journey. With a continued focus on gross margin and cash, as well as a return to organic growth. Our top priorities remain delivering margin expansion, cash generation, and balance sheet strength. To position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that, I will now pass the call back to Don.
Don Allan: Thank you, Pat. As you heard this morning, the company is committed to continuing to make meaningful cash generation, and restoring balance sheet strength. While also investing in future sustainable growth to drive share gain. Even as we draw closer to the end of our strategic transformation, we are keeping the pedal down and moving decisively to drive results. While we don't know the ultimate tariff policy environment at this time, we believe we can successfully manage through them. And achieve our long-term financial goals. By accelerating our growth culture with operational excellence at its core, we are positioning the company to deliver improved sustainable organic growth margins, and cash flow to support strong long-term shareholder return via significant EBITDA. We are now ready for Q&A, Dennis.
Dennis Lange: Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Star one one on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe good morning. Maybe just a first question, please, around the margin outlook. So maybe just remind us sort of what exit gross margin rates we should assume from this year. And on the operating margin line, I think the guide implies maybe 150 bps or so of increase this year versus 2024. Just wanted to check if that's the right ballpark in any kind of cadence of that expansion. Through the year. Thank you.
Patrick Hallinan: Hey, Julian. Yeah. Gross margin priority for us. And our full-year objectives in 2025 versus 2024, are approaching 250-ish basis points of full-year margin expansion. Some headwinds will temper the first half will be 100 plus basis points up year over year in the first half. Gross margin wise. Some of those headwinds are some of the carrying costs like logistics, and absorption costs from the back half of last year. The lower automotive mix and some FX. And then in the back half, we'll get the pricing we're gonna put in place due to FX. So, you know, you'll have 100 plus basis points of expansion year over year in the first half and, like, 300 plus in the back half to drive that full year. I'd say for the fourth quarter, we're expecting to exit somewhere right in that midpoint between 34 and 35%. On the quarter. And, certainly, I think your second question was around operating margin, which both operating and EBITDA margin you're in the ZIP code of being kinda 150 plus basis points. And, obviously, some of the same gross margin dynamics will color the op and EBITDA margin throughout the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the comments on the gross margin. I'm just wondering the, you know, what sort of SG and A investments are you planning for the year? And I'm just wondering, you know, you know, the step up we saw this quarter, is that in the run rate into 2025? Because it does feel like you're, you know, really sort of raising the ante on growth here. So I'm just wondering what sort of investments making support that growth.
Christopher Nelson: Hi, Nigel. It's Chris. Hope you're doing well. I'll start out and then pass it over to Pat. But, you know, specifically where we're looking to invest and where we are continuing to invest is we've focused more on our core brands starting last year as first and foremost, in making sure that we really drive outsized investment towards the professional in making sure that we have our pipeline of innovations really targeted towards that end user and making sure that we're accelerating product launches to make that end user safer and more productive on the job site. That's kinda job number one. And then as we've talked about in the past couple of announced we really focusing on making sure that we're putting local market market activation resources in the field. You know, we're I think we've been roughly 400 incremental folks in the field over the past know, over the past twelve months or so. And, you know, that is making sure that we can obviously underpenetrated, we can look to drive the market share growth that we see. As an opportunity, not only in in in what our largest market in the US, but obviously, we're looking at some other developing markets, specifically in EMEA. And then lastly, we are we are Yo. As we focus on those core brands of DEWALT, STANLEY, and CRAFTSMAN, we are investing incremental dollars into driving that brand health through increased, you know, promotion as well as advertising dollars there to to to really help drive those as our core brands moving forward. As far as the actual math on the run rates, I'll turn that over for It's a pact.
Patrick Hallinan: Yeah. Nigel, for the full year, we would expect SG and A as a percentage of net sales to be around 22%, maybe a little bit shy of exactly that amount. And, you know, any given quarter, you know, kinda bouncing around 22 to 21%. I think mostly around 22. You could just, with the normal seasonal sales surge in the second quarter, see it get closer to 21 in the second quarter, but that has more to do with the seasonality of sales than real meaningful change in investment cadence throughout the quarter. I kinda just you're gonna be closer to 22% quarter in, quarter out.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open.
Timothy Wojs: Hey, everybody. Good good morning. Thanks for the time. I I guess as you think about share gains, you know, and kinda and kinda furthering share gains in 2025 and and targeting low single-digit organic growth in tools. Could you just maybe discuss the the puts and takes to that? And I guess, really, what I'm wondering is how much of it is really accelerating and investing in DEWALT growth and and maybe seeing acceleration from that mid-single-digit growth you posted in 2025. Versus maybe seeing some of the non-default businesses kinda getting back to to market growth rates.
Christopher Nelson: Hey, Tim. This is Chris. I'll I'll I'll jump on that. One of your First, I would say that, absolutely, we, you know, we have seen nice progress in DEWALT over the past seven quarters as we as we noted earlier. And we are certainly, as we look at emphasizing professional, we are gonna continue to to build on that success and look for continued acceleration in the DEWALT brands. But the other two brands that we that we're making sure that we we invest in as our core brand being Stanley and Craftsman, we do expect to see stabilization and starting to see some some modest share gains as we move into this year as well. And we've been taking steps to starting to see the progress there. So it it's you know, certainly, we we're gonna continue to build on the momentum that we've established in DEWALT, and we wanna see and establish another couple areas of momentum with both Crafts it's Stanley.
Patrick Hallinan: I'd say one other thing, Tim, Tim, to keep in mind is, you know, we're really about the growth we're seeing and the seven quarters of DEWALT growth, I would just kinda remind you and others, in the back half, we have about a percentage point of of FX related price in there. Just so you're kind of if you're trying to build a walk year over year, second half to second half, you got about a percentage point of FX price that's also in the mix of that sales growth.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Lindsay with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Brett Lindsay: Hey, good morning all. Appreciate all the details on the tariffs I know it's a fluid situation. But as it relates to the $10 million to $20 million net impact for 2025, Can you just dimension how much of the offsetting actions are price mitigation, versus the supply chain reconfiguration, and then maybe any color on this, the pricing assumption embedded on a full-year basis?
Patrick Hallinan: Yeah. Yeah. We we obviously shared that that full-year impact on mitigated is in that $90 to $100 million range. And, you know, our ultimate job is to keep our brands competitive and and to work with our channel partners to keep them competitive. And so we're gonna be working to accelerate as we already were US cog base out of China And in the interim, you know, we will have to use some price on that. And we'll be working that in as appropriate in the coming weeks or months. The, you know, the real net impact is just the lag of getting measures in place and in particular some of the LIFO effects of when that forces some expense into our income statement in this first half of the year ahead of ahead of some of those actions actually hitting the p and l in the front half of this part of the year. Now we're gonna try to work it to zero. We're just trying to give people a range to think about which, you know, I'd say $10 to $20 million is certainly a workable range. And, again, we'll try to work it to zero if we can throughout the year. And thank you, Pat. That's a good answer to the question. Since you brought up tariffs, it's an opportunity to actually talk a little bit about why we feel like we've we've built a really solid plan to help us navigate through this period of time. And as we talk through probably for the last three or four earnings calls, We've been working through a planning process, and and then subsequent to that, an execution process. And for many of you who have followed us for a long time, you know, we went through tariffs in the first president Trump administration. We figured out how to navigate it back then. And we've built some muscle. We also have a really strong team that we've built here over the last couple of years. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, feel like we are well prepared to communicate this again. It will create a modest disruption for periods of time in the short term, But a reminder to everybody is that we You know, back in seven, eight years ago, about 40% of what we sold in the US came from China. And now we're down to a number that's closer to the mid-teens. And around 15%. And so substantial progress has been made not only in the last six months, but in the last six to seven years. And as Pat said in his comments, and just mentioned again, we're gonna continue to migrate away from China as a source for the US market. China will continue to be a source for other markets for us because it is a very strong operation from a manufacturing point of view. But I'll let Chris talk a little bit about what the execution plans are as much as we can because this is very fluid. Okay. Yeah. And, Don, thanks. You mentioned that we've we've really been working on not only the plan, but the execution since since earlier last year, and it's really three a three-pronged plan where with the first one has been working with for direct engagement with the policymakers. And we we we certainly look forward to continuing to work with the new administration. And we have been meeting with many of the key constituents in or around the new Trump administration since late last August. And, you know, making sure that as the administration, navigates how and, you know, how they would or could implement new tariffs, We are there and a voice to be heard as that happens. And, I think that that has been we found that to be a very positive, you know, relationship and a positive interaction thus far. We we plan to continue. Secondly, and this is kind of a continuation, but certainly, we've accelerated over the past six to nine months, is continuing to mitigate specific with a specific eye to derisking China our supply chain. As Don mentioned, we've made significant progress since the last tariff, you know, policy was put in place. And we've been accelerating the back half and you can see the results of where we are now. Now are gonna continue to drive those those actions and we're gonna continue to accelerate those supply chain moves. And we know how to do it. We're we're in the process of doing it. And and candidly, we really have never stopped doing it. And it's it's right on strategy for us as an organization because we do have a very large US manufacturing footprint, which is unique from our competition that we will continue to leverage as we go forward. And then lastly, and kind of, you know, the the more shorter-term aspect is saying, how do we need to make sure that we while we are working those other angles and those other parts the plan, are able to offset the immediate impact working with our channel partners and our end users on pricing actions. Now as we look to, you know, as we look to continue to mitigate, that'll be a part of the of the of the mix. But and it'll certainly be the the nearest term impact on that, which is remaining that we have yet to mitigate. So we feel really good about the plan we have in place and more importantly, the team we have executing. And I think that, you know, I I would I would just underscore the comments that we made earlier that we have full confidence in our long-term financial targets and margin aspirations that we we talked about during the investor day. And as tariffs come into place, it may be a temporary headwind as we as we navigate the the implementation plan we talked about, but it's not gonna have any long-term impact on our on our ability to reach those targets we've laid out.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to maybe just circle back a little bit appreciating the the answer detailed answer you just gave before on tariffs. But maybe just to kind of if I missed a couple of elements of it and and just wanted to zero in on a a couple of areas of clarification. First off, I believe at the Investor Day and and previously, you talked about a potential $200 million headwind for from China, if tabs went from 25% to 60%. How does that reconcile with the 10% incremental on China tariffs being $90 to $100? So, you know, it feels like I'm missing something there on the on the prior math or the current math. And also just to confirm in terms of the plan to mitigate I I would think I appreciate the fact that maybe these components are a little fluid, but I would think that in 2025, it would be primarily done through price and, you know, at the same time, setting up action maybe for 2026 to have any benefits from supply chain changes, if that's the right way to think about it. And if if there's also any similar types of thoughts around your exposure to Mexico, if those tariffs do come down the line also, if there are any similar plans in place?
Don Allan: Yeah. Well, I'll start. So think Chris did a very good job articulating our plan. Around tariffs. And, yes, as he said, the first steps will be around price. There will be obviously delays associated with that. Because we have to work with our customers to get these types of things in place. We also have to see if this situation settles down. It's still very fluid right now. And so those are all factors that we'll consider. In the meantime, as Chris said, we're continuing to move forward in our supply chain mitigation actions. Anything, we're accelerating them even faster than we were in the back half of last year. And so we will continue to move quickly make permanent fixes versus just, you know, pricing fixes. And so there's things that will continue to focus our energy on, and we feel like we have a very good plan to address this as both he and I mentioned. Mexico, you can see from the pie chart what the number is, and so it's a guess as to where that might go, but you can do the math yourself on that particular one. And I'll have Pat answer the question on the $200 million versus this current scenario.
Patrick Hallinan: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Don. And I'd start just with echoing what Chris was communicating is you know, we're focused on our long-term margin objectives. And so everything we're doing in addressing the tariff situation is to keep ourselves on the appropriate margin trajectory so we can invest in innovation and brand building and field support. And so that's you know, what underpins all of this, Mike, The first question you had around the the difference between the China scenario, we communicated in the fall versus the present, is really the fall scenario was confined to List three zero one up through part four a. And so it was a narrower set of SKUs but a higher obvious increase, and this is a lower increase, but basically, as we understand the current executive order, it's not confined to any set of SKUs. So that's the difference between the two scenarios of $90 to $100 million today is an incremental 10% on everything, versus in the past, it was going from 25 to 60 on a narrower set of thanks. And that's really the difference. And then as Don mentioned, you know, about 20-ish percent of our global COGS base predominantly in the tools and outdoor business comes from Mexico, but just as we're doing right now with China you know, should anything materialize with Mexico, you know, we will we will wait some days or weeks to make sure the dust is settled. And or at least settled sufficiently so that any move we're making kind of reflects potential knock-on effects. And we're we're kinda making one set of moves with our channel partners instead of whipsawing day to day or week to week.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Rob Wertheimer: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. And and just to you guys have covered tariffs pretty well. And just to switch away for a minute, I wanted to ask about the composition of core growth and tools and of core growth, basically, where you had, you know, 2% North America, 8% rest, we're all 4% Europe. So it's kind of the apps, so what I would've guessed in some ways. Anything structural going on there with share gain, with, you know, presence, maybe you could just comment on that.
Christopher Nelson: You. So I I think that, you know, we've we've I'll cover North America first and just say that we, you know, are strategy and the focus that we laid out over a year ago is is bearing fruit with the professional as we see a stronger professional market and stronger professional end user. And, specifically, you can see that progress with the wall. And, you know, that coupled with the fact that we have continued to make progress specifically in North America, on our ability to service our customers. And, you know, improving our fill rates that will allow us to continue to be able to entertain new opportunities for increased presence in in in their in their assortment is is made a nice difference that we see in North America. As far as if I go over to EMEA, I'd say that, you know, a part of what we laid out as well is that we were gonna look at making incremental investments in key markets that we saw not only a share gain opportunity, but we also saw k. Evolving in a in a in a in a in a better growth trajectory than some of the other more traditional markets. We've made those investments, and we're seeing tremendous payback on those, and we're seeing a lot of a lot of progress. And once again, specifically with with some of our our DEWALT offerings. So those are kind of, like, the key underpinnings that we see in in the share growth that we would as we pointed out, you know, in a in a market that we're thinking about for 2025 is being relatively flat, And then, you know, we we are reflecting the progress that we're seeing in those areas into our into our gut.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman and Associates. Your line is now open.
Adam Baumgarten: Hey. Good morning. Just on the promotional environment, you did mention a solid promotional season. Did that have any negative impact on gross margin in the quarter? And then maybe how you're thinking about 2025 from a from a promotional perspective.
Don Allan: Yeah. Yeah. Adam. I wouldn't call it negative because, you know, we're quite satisfied with the promotional placement that we had in the fourth quarter and the way we executed with our channel partners and what it delivered in the terms of growth. It was a slight marginal headwind to the quarter, obviously, because of what a promotion is. But I would say that, you know, 2024 was a year where, you know, like, at the end of 2023, we were getting very much back towards our traditional promotional cadence. 2024 was probably the first full year where we had both the supply chain and the calendarization back at the level we would expect to persist. And so I think it played a great role in making for a strong fourth quarter for us. And on the margin, it was a bit of a gross margin headwind. But I would say that you know, things like automotive mix were a bit a bit more of a headwind in the quarter than promotion. But, Chris, anything you would add?
Christopher Nelson: That's the only thing I promotional I would add to that as well, it does manifest itself with a a very modest Yo. Price impact in in the quarter that we we talked about. The placement that we received in getting back to the kind of where we see the healthy level of placement from a promotion that that the the space that we captured was to promote products that are accretive. So we feel good about our promotional positioning and feel good about coming back in capturing some of that that that share of that promotional space.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Thanks, Shannon. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-29 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 Third Quarter Webcast. Here today, in addition to myself is Don Allan, President and CEO; Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President, Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don, Chris and Pat will review our 2024 third quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we'll be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. Additionally, we may also reference non-GAAP financial measures during the call. For applicable reconciliations to the related GAAP financial measure and additional information, please refer to the appendix of the supplemental presentation and corresponding press release, which are available on our website under the IR section. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, our team again delivered gross margin improvements, as well as robust cash generation, all as a result of continued solid execution against our operational priorities, and framework we created over two years ago. As you saw in this morning's release, we remain focused on executing against key areas within our control, our supply chain transformation and initiatives to accelerate share gain. By executing our strategy, we continue to reshape our cost structure to capture efficiencies across our value chain and fund new growth investments in a slow, choppy market to gain share. We expect these actions together will further strengthen our powerful brands, accelerate innovation and enhance our in-market activation to position us as a supplier of choice and capture the compelling long-term opportunities in our industries we serve. Our priorities remain consistent as we work towards completing our strategic transformation. On today's call, you will hear about progress in each of our key areas of focus: gross margin expansion; strong free cash flow generation; and prioritize investments to stimulate sustainable growth and share gain. First, gross margin. We continue to drive profitability through the significant transformation of our supply chain to achieve our target of 35-plus percent gross margin. Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. Next, we experienced strong free cash flow generation behind profitability improvements, supporting further balance sheet strength. The progress on reducing our leverage has been significant in 2024. And finally, we have deployed new investments to stimulate sustainable growth with the primary goal of reinvigorating share gain to achieve organic growth at 2 times to 3 times the market over the long term. Through our transformation, we have stabilized the company and are setting a solid foundation for future growth and significant EBITDA expansion. We're also strengthening our organizational culture to be centered around organic growth with an operational excellence mindset, which we expect to carry forward into the future for the next decade. The entire Stanley Black & Decker team has persevered through challenges and with hard-earned self-generated momentum behind us, we have conviction that there are solid value creation opportunities in the short, medium and the long term. As we look at our markets in aggregate today, they remain relatively stable on the surface. That said, some continue to be pressured by the continuation of mixed consumer trends, especially related to housing, as well as weak automotive production backdrop. These factors are informing our current focus to refine and improve agility within our current cost structure. At the same time, we are funding new growth investments in the relatively healthy pockets of our business such as DEWALT professional tools, which gained share for the sixth consecutive quarter. We are optimistic that the markets will turn in our favor in the future as interest rate cuts in many geographies likely will prove to be an initial catalyst. There will be a lag between lower rates and the flow-through to demand for our categories, and we expect choppy markets will extend into the front half of next year until interest rate reductions have a greater effect and the U.S. election result is known and settled. As a short-cycle business, we will plan our production and inventory thoughtfully to ensure we are ready for stronger demand in the future, which could be as early as the second half of 2025. Before I get into the third quarter results, I'd like to mention our upcoming Capital Markets Day on November 20 at the New York Stock Exchange, which will also be available via live webcast. The leadership team and I are looking forward to hosting this event. We will use it as a forum for key leaders, many new to the company with fresh perspective, to share more about how the operational changes implemented over the last two years set us up for future success. We will discuss what is next as we continue to position the company to deliver higher levels of organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow over the long term, which will drive strong long-term shareholder return via significant EBITDA expansion. If you are interested in attending, reach out to Dennis and the IR team for more information. Now shifting to the third quarter results. We delivered $3.8 billion of revenue, down 5% versus the prior year with organic revenue down 2 points. Volume was down 3 points on a weak consumer backdrop and mixed end market demand, which was partially offset by a point [indiscernible]. We capitalized on pockets of relatively healthy market demand and delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of DEWALT growth, as well as higher sales in aerospace fasteners. The infrastructure divestiture, which closed early in the second quarter was a 2 point drag. Currency had a negative 1 point impact to revenue. Adjusted gross margin was 30.5%, up 290 basis points versus the third quarter of last year, a step-up primarily attributed to the supply chain transformation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.8%, which is up 140 basis points versus prior year. This was driven by our gross margin expansion partially offset by prioritized investments designed to deliver future market share gains. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.22 for the quarter. Free cash flow was approximately $200 million in the third quarter, which provided capacity to reduce debt by $100 million. Strong cash generation continues to support our ongoing capital allocation priorities, namely shareholder dividends, balance sheet strength and organic investments. Finally, we are narrowing our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to $3.90, up to $4.30 and reiterating our free cash flow guidance of $650 million to $850 million. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. I want to thank our team members for their persistence in staying focused and forging ahead despite a choppy macro environment. We continue to make substantial progress on our transformation plan and achieve the financial milestones we established over two years ago. We will remain committed to our investments for share gain and the margin expansion journey that is generally within our control. I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.
Christopher Nelson: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, third quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion, down 2% organically versus prior year. DEWALT was a bright spot, delivering its sixth consecutive quarter of organic growth as the brand continues to attract demand across the tools and outdoor product line. Price was plus 1% in the quarter, a weak consumer and DIY backdrop contributed to volumes declining 3%, with currency impacting revenue by another 1%. Third quarter adjusted segment margin rate was 11.1%, a 180 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter last year. Our supply chain transformation continues to help us deliver year-over-year margin expansion, while also funding our deliberate increase in growth investments. Turning to the product line performance for the third quarter. Power Tools declined 1% organically due to softness in consumer and DIY brands. On the positive side, DEWALT cordless products grew in the quarter. Volume was also supported by the initial holiday season sell-in across our priority brands. We are excited by a great lineup of offerings that will be available to our end users in the fourth quarter. Hand tools face similar pressure from the consumer environment and organic revenue was down 3%. However, we saw a strong customer response to our recent product launches of the DEWALT TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL storage lineup, as well as our expansion in the material handling space with the construction jack. These innovative new products designed to enhance end user safety and productivity were meaningful contributors to the DEWALT sales growth in the quarter. Outdoor organic revenue declined 3%, pressured by what we believe to be the final innings of destocking within the independent dealer channel. Turning to performance by region. North America declined 4% organically driven by the same factors as the overall segment. European revenue grew 1% organically despite a soft market backdrop. This was driven by double-digit growth in both Central Europe and Iberia, which more than offset pressure in the U.K. We are prioritizing investments to advance our regional presence and accelerate new product listings. These investments are designed to support market share expansion and will serve us well as our customers become more optimistic on the prospects for market growth. Our remaining regions, outside North America and Europe, in aggregate, delivered solid performance generating 6% organic growth. This was driven by double-digit growth in Latin America, led by Brazil, along with high single-digit growth in India. In summary, for Tools & Outdoor, growth in DEWALT was once again to highlight, along with the strong segment margin performance. As we look ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to continue to improve our gross margins and further strengthen our growth culture. Focusing on these two core imperatives allows us to prioritize resources and make new investments behind our best prospects for share gain. Now moving to Industrial. Third quarter revenue declined 80% on a reported basis versus the prior year, which was nearly all attributable to the infrastructure business divestiture. Organic revenue was down 1% as market softness in automotive contributed to segment volumes declining 2%, which was offset by 1 point of price. Automotive was down double digits as OEMs reduced light vehicle production schedules and constrained CapEx spending. The aerospace business grew 22% organically, supported by new content wins and a strong booking rate. General industrial fasteners was up low single digits, and we were pleased to see this business return to growth after prolonged customer destocking. The Industrial adjusted segment margin rate was 13.9%, an improvement of 170 basis points versus prior year, driven predominantly by price realization and cost control. This performance is notable given the mixed market conditions. We are encouraged to see the enterprise-wide transformation efforts resulting in adjusted operating margin expansion across both segments. Moving to the next slide. I would like to highlight a couple of examples of how we are thoughtfully and aggressively prioritizing resources to accelerate growth in Tools & Outdoor. First, we have committed to investing $30 million by 2027 in initiatives to support trades people and their priorities, including skills development. There is a shortage of trades people today and they are both our core end users and in high demand. We've already invested more than $10 million in the program and related initiatives since its inception and will continue to fund this commitment. The program is designed to grow the number of skilled trades people, which means investing both in initiatives to support newer generations entering into the trades, as well as to upskill trades people that are already established in their careers. Helping to solve the gap in trade skills is important not only to support the communities we serve, but it is also key to unlocking future growth in our industry. These investments also advance our end-user focused business strategy. By investing more to promote the long-term vitality and success of our professional end users, we can support both newer generations and established trades people to help expand trades capacity building deeper connections with our end users, while amplifying DEWALT's strong brand loyalty. To highlight a couple of recent examples where we partnered with organizations that share our commitment. On September 20, in honor of National Trades Person today, we announced that DEWALT awarded nearly $4 million in Grow the Trades Grants to 166 organizations in the United States and Canada, focused on skilling, reskilling and upskilling tradespeople. DEWALT also sponsors trade scholarships to support education in fields, including the concrete, mechanical, finishing and pipe trades. We are also proud of our long-standing partnership with WorldSkills. This year, the competition in Lyon, France, DEWALT was the Platinum partner. Stanley and Facom were also featured as official tools partners. One final highlight I'll share is our recent participation at the Tradeswomen Build Nations Conference in New Orleans. At our booth and throughout the event, our DEWALT team members spent time getting to know the Tradeswomen better, their personal experiences, challenges and aspirations. You're accustomed to hearing from us about new product innovations, but these investment programs are just as important. They are creating a virtuous flywheel by supporting our end users today to create more sustainable demand in the future. And as I shared last quarter, our loyal end users are one of the top essential attributes for success. We continue to prioritize building deeper connections with these end users to deliver purpose-built innovation. Another key attribute for success is our differentiated innovation engine. As a leader in total job site solutions, we are focused on continuing to empower our trades people on the job site by optimizing user workflow, productivity and safety. The recent unveil of the 20-volt MAX Grabo Lifter is one of several new additions to DEWALT's ecosystem of tools and technology that provides end-to-end solutions designed for trade professionals. The Grabo utilizes a powerful electric vacuum pump to help maximize user control during lifting, carrying or installation applications for a wide range of heavy construction materials. This is just one example of how we are focused on driving robust innovation to help solve the most pressing challenges our professional end users face, particularly to enhance safety and productivity on the job site. Our talented team is moving with speed and a clear mandate, executing our transformation plan and accelerating share gain. We are focused and organized, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Thank you very much, and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.
Patrick Hallinan: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. As Don shared, we continue to make meaningful progress on our transformation journey. I will now highlight our financial accomplishments during the third quarter and detail our focus on delivering our 2024 objective and our margin progression in 2025 and beyond. In the third quarter, we achieved approximately $105 million of pretax run rate cost savings, bringing our aggregate savings to approximately $1.4 billion since the program's inception. Our third quarter and program to date performance demonstrates strong execution by employees across our organization. We are tracking to plan, driven by consistent progress across our work streams. We are diligently capturing cost efficiencies amidst a backdrop of soft demand and freight inflation as we complete the transformation and pursue the actions needed to meet our gross margin objectives. Stepping back, we continue to target $1.5 billion of pretax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion of pretax run rate savings by the end of 2025. We are on track to achieve both targets as we work towards our 35% plus adjusted gross margin target. As a reminder, our core supply chain transformation savings initiatives are strategic sourcing, operations excellence, footprint actions and complexity reduction. Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date, driven by component-related savings captured in 2024. Sourcing activities are leveraging the advantages of a functional center of excellence, capturing economies of scale and rationalizing our supply base to focus spend on our critical strategic suppliers. Operations excellence is the next area of opportunity, which translates to productivity improvements across our system. This initiative leverages lean principles, which are being implemented at targeted sites throughout the globe. We are optimizing our distribution footprint, as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage scale and centers of excellence as we maximize operational efficiency. Approximately one-third of our facilities are undergoing significant change during 2024. We expect this work to continue into 2025 and potentially beyond. We are well underway with our platforming strategy as we identify methods to standardize parts and components across product families. The aim is simplicity which we will achieve by reducing complexity, improving procurement scale and ultimately decreasing the cycle time of our innovation process. We are combining this with a fresh design-to-value approach to better serve our customers at a competitive cost advantage. This method takes a holistic approach to designing and bringing new products to market faster, while also doing so more efficiently, which can generate material productivity and cost savings well beyond 2025. As much as it's a method, it's a mindset that we are instilling across the company as we continue to look for productivity enhancements going forward. I would like to commend the organization for diligently pursuing the goals of our transformation, this journey would not be possible without everyone's contribution. The progress we've shared today, including developing a sustainable cost structure and generating operational efficiency gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our gross margin objectives for 2024 and to achieve 35-plus percent adjusted gross margin as we work to close out the transformation. With that said, we believe this is not the end goal, rather a way point on the journey. Moving to the next slide. During the third quarter, we continued to make progress on two main areas of focus: generating free cash flow; and expanding gross margins to support investment in long-term profitable growth and share gain. We generated nearly $200 million of free cash flow in the third quarter. This brings year-to-date free cash flow broadly in line with where it was in the prior year. That said, and importantly, the composition of free cash flow reflects a healthier mix. In the current fiscal year, free cash flow is weighted towards cash earnings and benefits from transformation cost efficiencies in addition to working capital reductions, the latter of which dominated 2023 free cash flow generation. This shift in makeup is a strong signal that our profitability and operating improvements are translating to sustainable free cash flow generation. We are reiterating our full year free cash flow guidance range of $650 million to $850 million. We expect fourth quarter cash generation to be supported by positive earnings, working capital reductions from a seasonal drawdown of receivables as well as a modest reduction in inventory. Our 2024 outlook for capital expenditures is $325 million to $375 million, which is approximately $75 million lower at the midpoint than our previous assumption. This benefit for 2024 is offset by an expectation that we will carry slightly higher levels of inventory at year-end versus our July guidance. With that in mind, we are taking a measured approach to inventory management in the back half of 2024 and into 2025 as we navigate potential changes to the external environment and our markets, including the possibility for an acceleration of demand. Looking forward, we are planning to allocate free cash flow in excess of the dividend to support debt reduction, which we expect will result in a total gross debt balance that is a little over $6 billion as of the end of 2024. Beyond 2024, we are planning for further deleveraging with the goal to achieve our targeted leverage metrics of approximately 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA by year-end 2025. We plan to achieve this objective by utilizing excess free cash flow beyond the dividend and modest portfolio pruning actions. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin was 30.5% in the third quarter, a 290 basis point improvement versus prior year, primarily driven by savings from the supply chain transformation net of normal wage and benefit inflation. We are planning for further sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, supported by our supply chain transformation initiatives. Our current plan puts us on a path to achieve our goal of approximately 30% full year 2024 adjusted gross margin. Now turning to 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to reiterating free cash flow guidance, we are guiding GAAP earnings per share range to $1.15 to $1.75 and adjusted earnings per share range to $3.90 to $4.30 with both ranges narrowed, but unchanged at the midpoint as compared to our prior guidance. Our outlook factors in the continuation of a relatively soft macro environment in the fourth quarter, one that is marginally weaker than that anticipated at the end of the second quarter, driven by continued consumer softness and global automotive production declines that appear to have yet bottomed. As we have done throughout the year, we are leveraging the cost savings primarily within our control, to offset these pressures and generate adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming full year organic revenue will be down 1 percentage point with fourth quarter organic revenue declining approximately 1.5%. Our full year total revenue guidance, at the third quarter ending foreign currency rates, is relatively similar to our prior revenue guidance as recent currency rates are less negative than previously forecast offsetting the moderate incremental weakness in organic revenue. Turning to the segments. Our outlook for Tools & Outdoor full year organic revenue is unchanged at down 1% at the midpoint, plus or minus 50 basis points, with relatively flat pricing for the full year. We have updated our expectation for the Industrial segment to be down 1% at the midpoint, plus or minus 50 basis points. This assumption now incorporates more pronounced global automotive production headwinds than our prior guidance and assumes that the fourth quarter organic revenue will be in a similar zone to that at the end of the third quarter. Broadly, we remain positive about our industry's long-term growth prospects. Near term, we expect markets to remain choppy and soft. Until interest rate reductions have greater effect, global automotive production fully corrects, and the U.S. election result is known. We remain committed to our investments for share gain and the margin expansion journey that is generally within our control. Turning to SG&A. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management given the near-term market softness, while prioritizing investments for long-term organic growth. Our planning assumption for innovation, brand, marketing activation and technology growth investments remains an incremental $100 million in 2024. We expect full year 2024 SG&A, as a percentage of sales to be in the low 21% zone. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year, supported by savings from the transformation program. Our adjusted segment margin assumptions for Tools & Outdoor and Industrial are relatively consistent with our prior plan and expected to be up year-over-year. Our adjusted earnings per share range is $0.40 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor between the high and low end. We remain focused on our goals for adjusted gross margin and expect to manage SG&A thoughtfully in this environment. while working hard to make the investments that position the business for long-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pretax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $455 million to $485 million, unchanged at the midpoint versus prior guidance. These charges largely relate to the supply chain transformation program, the second quarter environmental reserve adjustment and the noncash brand impairment charge from the third quarter. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for the full year, which will imply a tax benefit in the fourth quarter. Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. In summary, we remain focused on executing our supply chain improvements to further improve gross margin and earnings. Our progress to date supports our narrowed full year earnings and free cash flow outlook. We remain confident that our actions to drive towards our target of 35% plus adjusted gross margin while funding additional organic revenue growth investments will continue to generate positive results. Our top priorities remain delivering margin expansion, generating cash and further strengthening the balance sheet to position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that, I will now pass the call back to Don.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Pat. As you heard this morning, the company is making meaningful progress across our key priorities of margin improvement, cash generation and balance sheet strength while also investing in future sustainable growth to drive share gains. We are moving decisively to continue to deliver results despite mixed end market demand, which likely will continue through the middle of 2025. We will stay focused on this consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow, which will drive strong long-term shareholder return via significant EBITDA expansion. We are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted -- if you could flesh out a little bit how you're thinking about next year as sort of within touching distance? So just wondered sort of are you still confident of that kind of 35% plus gross margin exiting next year? And if we think about the sort of construct as it looks today, should we be thinking sort of first half of next year flat to down sales similar to how you're exiting 2024? And then the margin expansion, it looks like operating margins, via exiting this year, up about 100 bps year-on-year in Q4. Is that a sort of a good placeholder early next year? And so next year, it's really about the second half when you see a big revenue and margin jump? Thank you.
Donald Allan: Thanks, Julian. So yes, we'll -- I'll let Pat give some color and thoughts of where we are related to 2025. And then I'll circle back at the end with some perspectives on progress in the transformation and how we close out the transformation in the next 12 to 18 months. Pat?
Patrick Hallinan: Yes, Julian, a lot in there. If I start with sales, I would say, we're not here to give precise 2025 guidance, but certainly, we expect the macros we're facing now to be characterizing the front part of next year. So soft and choppy, tools' demand and probably still some auto headwinds into the front part of next year. So more likely than not, we're expecting a flat to down start to the year. Obviously, we'll update that when we give guidance in the early days of 2025, but I'd say flat to down, more likely down is probably where we'd start. And then on the gross margin, gross margin has been a key part of our journey and remains a key part of our journey. And certainly, we continue to work towards 35% in the fourth quarter of next year. But the transformation is about gross margin improvement. It's also about returning to share-driven growth and to getting the margin and the growth together to achieve $2-plus billion of EBITDA output from the business. And as a team, we remain very confident in getting to 35% plus and to getting to $2 billion plus EBITDA. The timing of that is going to depend on the headwinds. We really feel like those are the right targets. But we've had a lot of headwinds in this journey. We are right now identifying and accelerating incremental activities to drive that margin expansion. And to the extent to which those accelerated activities are timed up enough relative to the headwinds. Again, we'll update you when we give guidance in the early part of next year. But that is certainly our focus, and it's going to be just a balancing act of the acceleration of our activities relative to the headwinds. And then in terms of the margin in the early part of the year, I mean, I think we will be 31-ish in the fourth quarter of this year. And then it will be a little bit of a similar dynamic as we click into the first half of next year relative to the back half of this year, where you have some of the natural seasonal headwinds from the Outdoor business in the early part of the year plus some of the under absorption from the slow demand in the back part of this year. So I do expect the year-over-year dynamics, at least first half of 2025 to first half of 2024, to look a little bit in terms of incremental improvement, a bit like what you saw from 2024 to 2023.
Donald Allan: If I just kind of circle back to the overall broader transformation framework that we established about 2.5 years ago roughly. And we went into this journey knowing that there were a handful of things that we needed to address. And obviously, the first thing was developing a muscle around organic growth and gaining share that had not been consistently in place at Stanley Black & Decker over the last several decades. We grew through a lot of other things such as acquisitions that created a significant amount of value. And so we continue to build that muscle, and that's an important part of this transformation. And both I and Chris made comments today and the progress in that journey, and we still have more progress to make. The other thing was the profitability of the business and the cash flow and getting ourselves to 35-plus percent. We still feel very strongly in our ability to get above 35% gross margin. The timing of it, as Pat said, could vary a little bit, but due to headwinds and other factors. But as we've gotten deeper and deeper into this in the last 18 months as we've worked together as a team, we see a lot of value drivers for the next three or four years that can continue to improve our margins and allow us to continue to invest more into the front end of the business so that we can develop the strength in the muscle. So we do gain share on a sustainable long-term basis in our industry, which is something that we think is the biggest value driver of all once we get our margins above that 35%. So more to come on that at Investor Day. We're excited to walk through more details in about three weeks from now. But we're very pleased with the progress, and we still are very committed to the overall objectives we established through the transformation 2.5 years ago.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Your line now open. Chris Snyder, your line now open. Please check your mute button.
Chris Snyder: Oh. Sorry about that. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the gross margin commentary. So it seems like 2024, maybe you will exit the year up 150 basis points. And to get to that 35% at year-end 2025, you kind of need to then have 2025 be up 350 year-on-year basis points. So I guess, was the prior commentary basically saying that that's not a year-end 2025 target anymore, it's kind of more in the distance? And I know that it's macro dependent. So maybe if there's anything you can kind of say on the macro that's needed to get to that 35% to exit next year? That would be helpful. Thank you.
Patrick Hallinan: Yes, Chris. I don't know that it's not the objective anymore. That's not what we said. We're still working towards it. It's really a question of given the headwind, the back part of this year, I'd say the back part of this year, our sales are about 1 point lower than we expected, and we still feel like auto hasn't fully corrected. That's a pretty profitable part of our industrial portfolio. And then while it's a smaller part of our portfolio, we'll probably see some blip next year from the Boeing strike. So it's just a question of will we tee up enough incremental and accelerated activities to offset that and any other headwinds that come our way. And we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We'll kind of update everybody on that when we get to guidance at the end of next year. It's still the working goal of our team. I'd say what's really going to affect it, probably as much or more than anything, is at what pace do interest rates start taking effect. And how quickly does auto correct because that's a very profitable part of that industrial business. And then how much fixed cost reduction activity will be able to both implement and complete in time for it to roll off the balance sheet next year. I think those will be the factors that affect that timing precisely. But like I said, that's still our working goal. And yes, along the way, the headwinds have certainly made the slope of next year a little bit steeper than we would have preferred. But we have every confidence we get to 35-plus percent. In fact, we see good opportunities of platforming to go beyond that. So I think the timing is just a match-up of headwinds versus accelerated activities.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open.
Timothy Wojs: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the color. Just a follow-up to that last question and then my question. So I guess first, Pat, could you just talk about what the accelerated activity is and kind of what cost buckets you're kind of attacking because you guys are already kind of taking out a lot of costs. I'm just kind of curious where the incremental pieces are? And then second, just Don, as you kind of changed the mindset internally from maybe something that's more acquisition and kind of integration focus to organic focused. What are the biggest changes that you need to make to the organization internally to kind of get that algorithm right?
Donald Allan: Why don't you start Pat? I'll answer that second.
Patrick Hallinan: I'll start, Tim. I mean as you mentioned, yes, we have a lot of streams of work going. I think when we're talking about 2025, and 2025 specifically, I think you're going to see acceleration on three fronts: sourcing, footprint and platforming, but the key to unlocking next year is probably more the middle one, footprint. But again, that's something we're still working internally, but we'll be pulling all three of those levers greater than expected. But I'd say the key to unlocking next year some footprint action.
Donald Allan: And thanks for the question, Tim, on the culture aspect of shifting from heavily weighted towards M&A to an intense focus on organic growth and market share gains. And it is something that we've been working very hard at for the last 2.5 years. But in particular, in the last 12 to 15 months, as Chris Nelson joined us, and he's made some changes to his team. And so I'm going to actually ask Chris to give some color on the things that we're doing within T&O. And then as we work through that, we'll begin to translate some of that over to industrial. So Chris, why don't you give us some more color on that?
Christopher Nelson: Absolutely. So thanks a lot for the question, Tim. I mean, first of all, I'd say the most important thing that we have been changing and leaning into is really our focus and alignment around our core brands, understanding that, yes, we produce products, but what our customers and end users count on us for is to be able to provide them the solutions that they need with the brands that they respect and trust. And I think that as we've organized more around a brand-centric culture and how we can then provide those solutions, that has been a significant cultural change to the organization. Secondarily, really as well as the laser focus that we have on the brand building also making sure that we have a very clear focus on what end users we are serving and making sure that we are driving innovation that they need for their -- to make their lives easier. Particularly making sure that with the professional end user, we are driving more purpose-driven innovation to make sure that we can enhance the safety and productivity of our professional end users on their job site and making sure that all the innovation that's going into our pipeline really serves that end goal and serves the brands that we are focused on. From a third thing is, really then making sure that we are focused on our speed to market that as we identify which brands we want to grow and as we identify the key pain points we want to address of those professional end users that we can get those products to market quickly and effectively in an integrated manner and make sure that we get those tools in the hands of our end users to drive growth. And then finally is really making sure that we think in terms of driving investment into the front end of the business, meaning that we want to have our Stanley Black & Decker representatives meeting with our end users and our customers to make sure that we're supporting them and explaining our innovations and driving share gain in the field and then working integrated marketing programs so that they can understand sample passed and then ultimately purchase and utilize our tools going forward. I think that pivot to driving the preponderance of our investment towards the front end is kind of the final piece of the puzzle.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Sprague: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess just one follow-up on some of the outlook questions and comments and then something unrelated to that. But first, just on -- again, sort of on the outlook and the trajectory, you had been previously kind of pointing to that $2 billion-plus of EBITDA in 2026. Pat mentioned it again, but didn't say anything about the time frame. Just wonder if your confidence on that is sort of slipping given the slow start to 2025? And then my other question is just kind of help us think about what's going on with share in North America you pointed to DEWALT gains that look like they are continuing and compounding on each other? Just also as a little mathematically curious though that North America sales and tools underperform each of your three categories, right, North America, down 4%, but PT only down 1% hand tools and outdoor down 3%. So is there something else going on there, maybe speak to share on CRAFTSMAN and Stanley brand? Or any other perspective you just kind of add on that complexion of the North American sales?
Patrick Hallinan: Hi, Jeff, it's Pat. I'll take the outlook question and then I'll let Chris comment on U.S. market share. So I would still say, no, our -- we'll be very much targeting $2-plus billion of EBITDA by 2026. In fact, I think kind of on a rolling four quarter basis, that's probably somewhere in the front half of 2026. So I don't think anything has changed there. As I mentioned in the gross margin comments, we're accelerating initiatives to offset the headwinds, but we're also going to manage our total income statement to drive the EBITDA. I mean, we recognize the value driving EBITDA growth as quickly as possible. And so I don't think there's anything that's changed in terms of a meaning time frame, a meaningful time frame on EBITDA expansion. Like I said, probably on a rolling basis sometime in the front part of 2026, we're at that $2 billion-ish threshold.
Christopher Nelson: All right. Jeff, this is Chris. Nice hearing from you. Just to provide a little more color on the share in North America. What I'd say is that, first of all, we're confident that we are stable to slightly growing our share over the course of this year for sure. And as you pointed out, we've certainly been experiencing nice success in that share gain with the DEWALT brand. I think underlying that would be a little bit of the dynamic we have been talking about where that the Pro is relatively stronger than the DIYer due to the -- some of the underlying consumer trends. And as a result, we certainly have seen that play out and impact the CRAFTSMAN brand more than the DEWALT brand. So I think that as we see that not only the strength of that brand continuing to grow, but that as we see the consumer strengthen as well. As we talked about thinking about somewhere in the back half of next year, we should see some of that additional momentum kind of compound what we're seeing with DEWALT.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Patrick Hallinan: Good morning.
Nicole DeBlase: Can you guys talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the cost side? Totally appreciate the additional pressures with respect to top line, but steel costs are down. Obviously, your component costs and input costs are much broader than steel. But if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and how that's impacting gross margins?
Donald Allan: Nicole, I'll would say, we kind of expected all year materials to be slightly down, freight to be slightly up. And I'd say, thematically, that's largely been the play that's been running. Where I would say is ground freight in the U.S. has been a bit higher and a bit more persistent than we would expect. And so you kind of put the two together, you have some net inflation from ground freight, which -- and the ground freight seems to be moving these days a bit more from labor cost and actual vehicle capital cost as opposed to fuel. And so neither have been at extremes, I'd say just slightly higher headwinds from freight offsetting, as you mentioned, some of the material tailwinds that we would see. And I'd say for next year, at this point, we're kind of expecting kind of neutral price cost and no extremes inflation or deflation.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Obviously, a lot of talk about the gradient of the gross margin improvement here. So is the message -- the $2 billion of exit rate for next year is still in place, but we've got some volume and mix factors at play here. I just want to make sure that's the case? And maybe just, Don, just talk about the election and some of the scenario plan you've got in place there, obviously, if Trump wins, tariffs are in play. Just maybe just address that. Thanks.
Donald Allan: You want to take that first part, Chris?
Christopher Nelson: I'll start with the first part, Nigel. Yes, I'd say we're focused on all three, returning to share gain driven growth, gross margin and EBITDA. And yes, the precise timing of 35% may alter slightly, but we still feel like on an exit run rate basis or a rolling a 12-month basis, we're hitting that $2 billion EBITDA threshold in the first part of 2026, and that's still our focus, and we'll manage the total income statement to get there.
Donald Allan: Yes. And then the tariff front related to the election. If Trump wins the election, we are likely in a new tariff regime. It is a question of the magnitude at this point exactly how that will be rolled out and will it be specific to industries or more broad-based? How many countries will be covered in it? And so there's a lot of still unknowns associated with it. However, as we've mentioned in previous settings, we have been planning for this possibility since the spring and have gone through a variety of different scenarios to plan for. And obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we put into the market. And so we've worked through a lot of that. We'll continue to work through as if the scenario plays out and the tariffs become more concrete. We will work through getting those into the market in a reasonable time frame, knowing that there's usually some type of delay given the processes that our customers have around implementing price. The second thing is we've built a fairly robust plan of how we would mitigate over the next two years, these tariffs by moving production and aspects of the supply chain to different parts of the world. And some of that would be potentially moving things from China to other parts of Asia, maybe to Mexico, we'll see but likely to other parts of Asia. And so unlikely that we're moving a lot back to the U.S. because it's just not cost effective to do. And there's questions about whether we even have the labor to actually do that in this country. So we have a fairly robust plan. What we don't know is which scenario is going to play out and exactly how that would be. Is it going to be just China? Is it going to be every country? Is it going to be 60% China? Or is it going to be 25% China for everything? Those are all things that are to be determined. But I feel like we have a playbook on the shelf ready to go, depending if this scenario plays out. And then obviously, we've been working our government relations activities vary significantly over the summer into the fall to educate a variety of different politicians as to this industry and the dynamics of supply chain and how we serve our customers and how this would actually play out over the next two years. So that's an important part of the process as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.
Adam Baumgarten: Hi, guys. Just on the path of gross margins from here. Obviously, I know implied 4Q, should we expect gross margin to step down sequentially in 1Q and then move higher quarter-over-quarter from there next year, kind of like you saw this year?
Patrick Hallinan: Yes, Adam, I don't know that I'd get that precise in the sense that we'll get into the early parts of next year, things that drive gross margin variability across the early months of the year are just the mix of outdoor relative to everything else. And in this case, as we head into 2025, it will be a little bit of how much of the auto correction in our industrials businesses, is starting to slow down or whether it's still in midstream. And so I would just say, I think it's going to -- broadly, if you look at half to half, you'll just see somewhere in the 31-ish percent, maybe 31%, plus or minus a few bps throughout the first half. Maybe we can accelerate a few things and get it above that. But I don't know that I'd start getting specific timing fourth quarter to first quarter because those types of things are going to get into very specific shipment flows.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Rob Wertheimer: Thanks. Good morning. I wonder if you could unpack just a little bit more of the North American Tools & Outdoor? Maybe some of that is your channel partners wanting a different inventory strategy? Maybe some of that is just weakness at retail? Maybe some of that is an expectation of a weaker holiday season? Just maybe give a sense of order of magnitude how the different factors are contributing to the [indiscernible]? Thank you.
Patrick Hallinan: Yes. So I think there's a few things in there. One would be that first and foremost, our POS was modestly negative in the quarter. And that's what we expected, and we had talked about that probably being the case as we -- one of the dynamics is as we rolled off of what was an earlier start to the outdoor season, we kind of normalized in Q3. Secondarily, we do see there being much more momentum and strength on the professional than there would be on the DIY. And if you look at some of the underlying kind of metrics that we look at in the marketplace to explain that, there's obviously consumer sentiment, but then there's also the activity levels for R&R activity. which are notably down this year. And I think that, that's probably having a pretty significant effect on what we're seeing in the DIY as well. Moving forward, as we talked about, we don't see any real catalyst in the first quarter or first half that will change those dynamics, but we are optimistic on taking a look at the longer-term trends in our industry. And as we start to see some of the improvements in some of those longer-term construction spending, construction earnings, R&R activity, residential home starts, we'll see more progress and growth in the marketplace.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lang, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 second quarter webcast. Here today, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO; Chris Nelson, COO, EVP, and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11:00 A.M., today. This morning. Don, Chris and Pat will review our second quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcasts, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's, therefore, possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing. Additionally, we may also reference non-GAAP financial measures during the call. For applicable reconciliations to the related GAAP financial measure and additional information, please refer to the appendix of the supplemental presentation and the corresponding press release, which are available on our website under the IR section. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in this morning's release, we extended our trajectory of solid execution on our operational priorities, which drove gross margin improvement versus the prior year and very strong cash generation in the second quarter. It is also extremely satisfying to report that we delivered organic growth this quarter. As you are aware there was a significant demand normalization post-pandemic that required a recalibration of inventory for us and our customers. We believe that we have stabilized our share position in the marketplace. And this quarter we capitalized on the strengths of the DEWALT plan and supportive pockets of end market demand to deliver positive organic revenue growth in the period. Our priorities remain consistent at this stage of our transformation. And this morning you will hear tangible progress in each of these key areas of focus. First, we continue to drive profitability improvement through the significant transformation of our supply chain to achieve our target of 35% plus gross margins. Next, we experienced strong free cash flow generation and significant balance sheet strength improvement. And finally, new investments to stimulate sustainable growth are increasing with the primary aim of reinvigorating share gain to achieve organic growth at two times to three times the market. We continue to be energized by the compelling long-term growth opportunities in our industry and believe in our ability to capture their value. Yet we remain clear eyed about the near-term environment and expect mixed demand trends to continue in 2024 across our markets. As we capture the savings from the cost structure improvements, which are broadly in our control, we will be measured and disciplined as we selectively invest in the parts of our business that offer the best prospects for growth. We are focused on how we outperform the market to gain share and are pleased by the green shoots emerging in various channels. So while our markets will be choppy for the short-term, we are building the processes and structure to create a sustainable growth operating model which will ensure we significantly benefit from the long-term growth opportunities in the industries we serve. I have asked Chris to describe how we are both thoughtfully and aggressively pursuing our growth agenda in Tools & Outdoor, which he will discuss in further detail this morning. Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. Our teams continue to accelerate savings actions, which have successfully delivered $1.3 billion of run rate savings program to-date. These results reinforce our confidence in achieving our 35% plus adjusted gross margin goal. I am confident that by executing on our transform strategy, we are positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow, which will drive strong long-term shareholder returns. Now, turning to second quarter results, we delivered $4 billion of revenue, down 3% versus the prior year. This includes 1% of organic growth, which was led by DEWALT, the outdoor product categories and Engineered Fastening. This was more than offset by a 3% drag from the infrastructure divestiture and 1% of currency. Adjusted gross margin was 29.2%, up 560 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. Our supply chain transformation was a major contributor to this improvement. It has strong momentum that we expect to carry through the back half and into 2025. Adjusted EBITDA margins returned to double-digits and were 10.7%, which is a five point improvement versus prior year. This was driven by our gross margin expansion, offset by deliberate increases in growth investments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.09 for second quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter approached $0.5 billion, primarily due to accelerated working capital improvements, the strong cash generation, along with proceeds from the infrastructure divestiture, contributed $1.2 billion of debt reduction in the quarter. We continue to prioritize improving balance sheet health, and in a few moments, Pat will address our plans for more progress over the next 18 months. As we delever, we are also maintaining our commitment to returning value to our shareholders and to that end, our Board of Directors approved a modest increase to our quarterly cash dividend, which is now $0.82 per share. Finally, we are raising our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.10 at the midpoint to a range of $3.70 up to $4.50 and increasing our free cash flow guidance to $650 million up to $850 million. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. I want to thank our team members for their collaboration and focus as we continue to make substantial progress on our transform plan and achieve our interim financial goals we established about two years ago. I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance. Chris?
Christopher Nelson: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, second quarter revenue was approximately $3.5 billion with 1% organic growth versus prior year. DEWALT delivered another strong quarter, generating its fifth consecutive quarter of organic growth. DEWALT's performance, combined with a stronger outdoor season drove 2% volume growth. We are particularly encouraged by this result, given the soft consumer backdrop. Total revenue was flat as volume benefits were offset by 1% of currency in addition to 1% of price, which was consistent with our plan to support DEWALT cordless promotions. We are now back in line with historical levels of seasonal promotions. Second quarter adjusted segment margin was 10.4%, a 590 basis point improvement compared to last year. We delivered year-over-year margin expansion through lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions, which were partially offset by targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Turning to product lines for the second quarter. Power tools declined 2% organically, driven by the consumer DIY category. Hand tools organic revenue was flat with new DEWALT product introductions driving increased product listings with our customers. Outdoor organic revenue grew 6% with strong retail volume growth, driven by handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America generated 1% organic growth, driven by the same factors as the overall segment. Second quarter US retail point-of-sale demand was up modestly versus the prior year, led by outdoor and regain DEWALT cordless promotions. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Italy were partially offset by growth in the UK, the Nordics and Iberia. We are prioritizing investments and new product listings to grow market share and overcome the macro softness that is affecting this region's economy. To round out geographic performance for the quarter all other regions in aggregate grew 5% organically. This was driven by double-digit growth in Latin America, led by Brazil, along with high single-digit growth in India. In summary, for Tools & Outdoor, the quarter was highlighted by a return to organic growth with a meaningful step-up to segment margin. Now moving to Industrial. Second quarter Industrial revenue declined 20% versus last year, which was nearly all due to the infrastructure divestiture. Price contributed positive 2% to growth, offset by a 2% currency headwind. The Engineered Fastening business grew 2% organically, driven by aerospace growth, which more than offset the market softness in automotive and customer destocking in general industrial. The Aerospace business grew 24% organically, supported by new business wins and a strong booking rate. The Industrial adjusted segment margin was 13.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points versus prior year, driven by price realization and cost control. I'd like to thank our teams around the world for their dedication to delivering another solid performance in the second quarter. Their focused efforts delivered organic growth and margin expansion across both business segments. Moving to the next slide. As I reflect on my first year here at Stanley Black & Decker, much of my time and energy has been directed towards learning about our end users' and channel partners' priorities and how to both efficiently and effectively accelerate the next phase of Tools & Outdoor organic growth and market share gains. It's clear to me that we have four essential attributes for success. One, an industry with strong long-term growth characteristics. Two, iconic brands. Three, a differentiated innovation engine. And four, deep customer relationships and loyal end users. I have strong conviction that we can create long-term value by capturing the commercial opportunities ahead of us, both now and into the future. To capture these opportunities, we are funding investments both by redirecting existing resources towards the most promising opportunities as well as investing incremental dollars consistent with the $300 million to $500 million range that Don and Pat have referenced on previous occasions. Along with market-facing priorities, I've also been focused on our team putting in place the right capabilities and skills to execute our strategy. I am pleased to have my new organization established with a leadership team consisting of seasoned Stanley Black & Decker veterans complemented by external talent who bring fresh perspectives. They are all in place in driving forward momentum. The valuable breadth and depth of knowledge across the leadership team and organization is allowing us to activate our strategy with urgency. We are prioritizing our resources on the highest impact opportunities which we believe are serving the professional end user within our most attractive market. Over the past 12 months, as we continue to streamline and focus our business, we've doubled down on being brand-led and are prioritizing DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and STANLEY. These powerful brands have significant scale in the marketplace and strong brand equity with end users. By continuing to strengthen these brands and maximizing brand health, we can capitalize on their potential for long-term growth, share gain and margin improvement. Turning to innovation. We view our long-standing ability to listen to end users and to deliver purpose-built innovation as a core differentiating capability. We are laser-focused on driving innovation to help solve the most pressing challenges our professional end users face, namely finding ways to improve their safety and productivity on the job site while ensuring they have robust tools to help deliver the high-quality craftsmanship their customers expect. Our core brands have been synonymous with delivering this type of value to job sites for many years, and we will continue to push the boundaries of these solutions as enhancing safety and productivity on the job site has never been more relevant to the professional end user. For example, we announced the next evolution in battery technology this quarter, the DEWALT XR POWERPACK 8 AH Battery with tabless cell technology. This joins the reinvigorated XR line, which houses the best-performing 20-volt MAX batteries and power tools from DEWALT. This battery technology conducts more energy, delivers more power output and has a longer lifespan, which enhances end-user productivity. We also introduced the DEWALT TOUGHSERIES Construction Jack, a tool designed to increase productivity by giving one person, the confidence and security to lift, level and hold material without assistance. With up to 340 pounds of lift capacity and fine-tuning adjustment features, this tool is a must-have for any end user. Market activation is another investment priority and growth opportunity. We are more aggressively activating our core brands through amplified digital product marketing and additional field resources, both with the goal of extending the reach and impact of our brands and innovation. We expect our elevated marketing efforts behind DEWALT, coupled with support to grow the trades through grants, scholarships and tool donations will broaden user engagement and brand ambassadorship. These sales and marketing initiatives are funded with new investment dollars and reallocation of resources, which illustrates our prioritization efforts towards our best prospects for growth. In addition to delivering cost savings and driving margin improvement, which you have heard from Don, our supply chain transformation is also an enabler of growth, enhancing operational efficiency and achieving 35% plus adjusted gross margin unlocks incremental optionality to invest even more behind our brands and to accelerate the virtuous cycle of organic growth. We believe that our emphasis on operational excellence in combination with the structural changes we are making to our production and distribution network which are the crux of our supply chain transformation can become a sustainable growth enabler for the company as we serve our customers and end users with excellence and speed. In addition, the continuous improvement capabilities we are strengthening as a part of this transformation will serve as a sustainable engine to help generate recurring productivity to self-fund the business and our brands. In summary, while the near-term market demand environment remains mixed, we are optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities in our industry. We are aggressively moving forward to accelerate the growth of our powerful brands with our end users and customers around the globe. We have a talented team deployed that is moving with speed and a clear mandate, executing our transformation plan and accelerating share gain. This simple but powerful mandate energizes our team as we work to position ourselves to win in the marketplace. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.
Patrick Hallinan: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Turning to the next slide. We're two years into our transformation journey and are continuing to make meaningful progress each quarter. I would like to highlight our accomplishments during the second quarter and how we intend to meet our objectives with continued focus and intensity during the back half of 2024 and beyond. We achieved approximately $150 million of pre-tax run rate cost savings in the quarter, bringing our aggregate savings to approximately $1.3 billion since program inception. Our performance represents strong execution. On a year-to-date basis, we are tracking to plan, driven by strategic sourcing actions. We are diligently capturing cost efficiencies to counter the soft demand backdrop. I am pleased to say the savings we generated in the first half support the second half gross margin expansion included in our guidance. More on that later. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the year-end of 2024 and $2 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2025. We are on track to achieve both targets. As a reminder, the biggest areas where we see savings opportunities are strategic sourcing, operations excellence, footprint actions and complexity reduction. Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to-date. We are actioning $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components, finished goods and indirect expenditures. Operations excellence is the next area of opportunity. Our initiatives are driving productivity improvements that translate into tangible results. This initiative encompasses our manufacturing operating model and leverages lean principles. In 2024, this has been particularly effective in reducing downtime and improving labor efficiency. We have a robust pipeline of projects lined-up to deliver savings this year and beyond. Turning to footprint-related projects and product platforming. We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage scale and centers of excellence as we maximize operational efficiency. This multiyear endeavor continues to progress as planned and we expect to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe over the next 18 months. We are well underway with our platforming strategy, which identifies methods to standardize parts and components across product families to eliminate complexity and to improve procurement scale. We are incorporating this strategy into our product development process across power tools and outdoor products with significant opportunities across DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and zero-turn mowers. This exciting program is in the early innings and we believe it can be a source of material productivity well beyond 2025. In aggregate, our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024, achieve a full year gross margin of 30% and fund additional growth investments in our core business. I would like to commend the organization for diligently pursuing the goals of our transformation. This journey would not be possible without everyone's contributions. We are developing the sustainable cost structure and operational efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. Two main areas of focus this year are generating free cash flow and expanding gross margins to support long-term growth and value creation. We generated a historically strong $486 million of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2024. This brings our year-to-date free cash flow to approximately neutral. Our performance was supported by approximately $400 million of accelerated working capital improvements, which were realized earlier in 2024 versus our initial plan. We continued to make progress on our inventory levels and sequentially reduced our inventory balance by approximately $100 million this quarter. Inventory days remained below 150 and are moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. The remainder of the working capital favorability was a result of improved accounts receivable and accounts payable balances versus our plan. Our strong free cash flow, along with the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale enabled $1.2 billion of commercial paper reduction during the second quarter. The strong momentum in the first half and a modest reduction to our capital spending expectations gives us the confidence to raise our full year free cash flow guidance range to $650 million to $850 million, up from our prior range of $600 million to $800 million. We expect second half free cash flow in excess of the dividend to support an additional $400 million to $500 million of short-term debt reduction by year-end, which will result in a total debt balance that is a little over $6 billion. In 2025, we are targeting further deleveraging through free cash flow generation, coupled with the funds generated by strategic portfolio pruning actions. Our goal for the year-end 2025 is total debt in the low $5 billion zone, inclusive of inorganic cash generation. This plan enables us to achieve our desired leverage metrics and is consistent with the discussions with our rating agencies. Another item of note, this past quarter, we proactively renegotiated the company's core credit facilities, securing access to significant liquidity to support the company's ongoing transformation. We prioritize maintaining investment-grade credit ratings and have access to $3.5 billion in credit facilities backed by a long-standing, well-capitalized and diversified bank group. Our capital allocation priorities remain investing in our organic growth and our transformation, funding our long-standing cash dividend to return value to shareholders and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin was 29.2% in the second quarter, a 560 basis point improvement versus prior year, driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. In the first half of 2024, we improved adjusted gross margin by 40 basis points sequentially versus second half 2023 consistent with our plan. We are planning for further sequential improvement in the second half of this year with adjusted gross margin expected to approximate 31%. Our second half step-up is supported by our supply chain transformation savings, which are and have been tracking to plan. This plan puts us on a path to deliver our long-held transformation goal of approximately 30% full year 2024 adjusted gross margin and exit the year in the low 30s. We continue to be on a solid trajectory of adjusted gross margin improvement against a challenging macro backdrop. Our momentum gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our gross margin objectives for 2024 and achieve 35% plus adjusted gross margin within the transformation time horizon. Now turning to our 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the updated free cash flow guidance I just shared, we are revising GAAP earnings per share range to $0.90 to $2 and raising adjusted earnings per share range to $3.70 to $4.50. The GAAP earnings per share revision is primarily a result of incorporating the second quarter environmental reserve expense of approximately $155 million into the range. Adjusted earnings per share is being revised $0.10 higher at the midpoint. Our outlook factors in a soft macro environment in the second half. We are leveraging the cost savings within our control to offset this and generate second half adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year. The EPS improvement at the midpoint passes along a portion of the second quarter operating outperformance and includes lower back half interest expense due to accelerated deleveraging. Our midpoint assumption for full year organic revenue is expected to be down 0.5 percentage point. This contemplates the continuation of the stretched consumer in Tools & Outdoor along with a declining automotive production backdrop in Industrial. Our sales range contemplates plus or minus 130 basis points, which is the primary area of adjusted earnings per share variability. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor full year organic revenue is expected to decline 1% at the midpoint plus or minus low single-digits, with a range of variability similar to the total company. Pricing for Tools & Outdoor is expected to be relatively flat for the full year, which is consistent with what we are seeing in the market today. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive as aero fasteners growth is partially pressured by global automotive OEM light vehicle production headwind. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding and reprioritizing investments for long-term organic growth. Our planning assumption for innovation, brand, marketing activation and technology growth investments remains an incremental $100 million in 2024. Our expectation for full year SG&A as a percentage of sales is to be in the mid-21% zone. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year, supported by savings from the transformation program. Adjusted segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year, also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial adjusted segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus the prior year as operating improvements and cost controls in Engineered Fastening are offset by the dilution from the Infrastructure business divestiture. Our adjusted earnings per share range is $0.80 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor. We will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for long-term growth. Turning to other elements of our guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $445 million to $495 million largely related to the supply chain transformation program as well as the second quarter environmental expense. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for the full year with the third quarter approximating 20% and a benefit in the fourth quarter. Our 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 25% of the full year at the midpoint. In summary, looking forward, we remain focused on executing our supply chain improvements to further improve gross margin and earnings in the second half of 2024 and our progress to-date supports our improved full year adjusted earnings and free cash flow outlook. We remain confident that our actions to drive toward our target of 35% plus adjusted gross margin, while funding additional organic revenue growth investments will continue to generate positive results. Our top priorities remain delivering margin expansion, generating cash and further strengthening the balance sheet to position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Pat. As you heard this morning, the company is making meaningful progress across our key priorities of margin improvement, cash generation and balance sheet health, while also investing in future sustainable growth. We are moving with speed and delivering results in a macro environment that has not been supportive, but we are confident that it will turn from a headwind to a tailwind in the future. Until then, we are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth, improved profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. We are now ready for Q&A, Dennis.
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Julian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe just a question around the earnings trajectory. So it looks like sort of EPS is guided to be flattish sequentially in Q3 and then up, I think, $0.40 or so sequentially in the fourth quarter. So understand the sort of tax rate movement from 20% to negative tax in Q4, but maybe if you could flesh out any of the moving parts around sort of revenue and margin for the third and fourth quarter. And on that tax rate point, what's a good kind of placeholder for next year, please?
Patrick Hallinan: Hey, Julian, it's Pat. Yes, you have it correct. That's the correct EPS flow. I'd say the fourth quarter seasonal revenue impact is what drives the revenue and OM in the fourth quarter. So you're slightly north of $3.5 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter. And you're probably in between $300 million and $330 million in the OM range in the quarter with the flow in the third quarter, obviously rounding out the back half of the year. The third quarter is seasonally strong as some of the holiday shipments start humming around the September time frame. In terms of the tax drivers, as we've said before, these were some of the things that were in motion and affecting tax last year in '23, a set of discrete planning items that were put in motion even early stages of COVID and before. And so it will play out through this year and a bit into next year. I'd say for next year, we're probably in the high teens, approaching 20% range would be my guidance for tax for next year. We're obviously not at '25 guidance yet, but that would be kind of the ZIP code I would expect to be in.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open.
Timothy Wojs: Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Timothy Wojs: Nice to see volume growth in tools. Maybe on that kind of topic, Don, just maybe if you can give us a little bit of an update just on the operating environment. It doesn't seem like a lot has changed, but kind of curious on your opinion there and just how your retailers are kind of thinking about kind of the promotional period at the end of the year. And then you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks a few times product listing ads and product focused ads there. If you could maybe just talk about some of the investments and where some of the priorities are and just maybe where you're kind of focused on adding incremental shelf space.
Christopher Nelson: All right. Hey, Tim, this is Chris. Nice hearing from you and good morning as well. As far as the first part of the question from an operating environment perspective, as the guidance would indicate, we're essentially expecting the back half to have a similar operating environment as the front half. And we are dialed in to be back up to our run rate level of promotional support in the back half of the year. We feel very excited about what we've got laid in with our retailers and especially with our ability to drive more promotion and demand in our accretive cordless power tool segment. So that's what we're kind of looking at for the back half. As far as in that environment, what is really important is, and that we're -- as you heard from Don, we are absolutely committed to is executing our strategy. So if you think about what's going to really drive our performance in the back half and beyond, it's going to be continuing that supply chain transformation that allows us to not only drive margin accretion, but as our service levels continue to improve, we're getting more opportunities to take share and shelf space in that environment as we fulfil better for our customers. And then if we think about the investments, what we are committed to do with the investments that we're -- and the incremental margins that we're generating is to make sure that we funnel those to our highest growth priorities. Specifically, we've been talking about how we want to make sure with STANLEY, CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT, we are focusing on those brands and specifically investing in both market activation from a digital marketing perspective as well as we've been working to add field resources to make sure that we can work with our end users and our customers to make sure that they are -- understand our story, understand our products, and we can continue to get feedback on where we need to drive innovation. So that combination of the transformation with targeted investment that we're committed to, we've started to see some encouraging performance, especially as you've heard for the past couple of quarters with DEWALT. So we're going to stay committed to that and understand that we're going to navigate a fairly flat macro environment.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Sprague: Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, with perhaps fingers crossed, right, getting close to some kind of cyclical bottom here on the consumer, the economy, rates, the whole thing, really want to kind of step back and get maybe a refresh perspective, Don, maybe starting with you, but just on what really normalized could look like. And the spirit of the question kind of goes, right, $2 billion in cost reduction is something like $11 a share, right? Investments of $200 million to $300 million is $2 or $3. So there's a lot of "gross savings" in that construct. But where is the leakage on a net basis, right? And as revenues recover maybe in the construct of that 35% gross margin, what really is kind of a realistic EBITDA margin on a normalized basis? Sorry for the philosophical question on an earnings call, but interested in your thoughts.
Donald Allan: Well, it's actually a very good question, Jeff, because it's something that we spend time actually thinking about as we go into our annual strap planning cycle, which is just beginning now and be part of a Board presentation in October as we think through where we are in the transformation journey, the financial goals that we've established, what's the earnings potential for Stanley Black & Decker over the next three years and beyond. And so when you step back and begin to think that through, we clearly feel very good about where we are in the journey around transformation. We think 35% plus is still very achievable in that time horizon. We do believe as the markets begin to get stronger or stabilize and start to grow and in some time frame, I think, we're all wondering exactly what that time frame is, but let's presume that happens in the next year or so then we really think we're building an operating model around organic growth. As we said, that can grow two times to three times in the market. And so how do you define the market? We've done a lot of different analysis on this, and there's different ways to look at it in the short-term. But over the long-term, if you just look at GDP and say, can we grow two times to three times GDP over the long-term, we definitely think that is achievable. And so that puts you in a mid to high single-digit growth mode depending on GDP over the long-term. And then what's the ultimate leverage you're going to get from that growth or benefit into margins. And I still think this is a 40-ish percent business as you grow and you leverage the effect of that. We will continue to invest. We're seeing the benefits of investing. We said $300 million to $500 million, and it probably is going to trend closer to that $500 million number in the time horizon we've talked about. So the earnings potential is strong. I'm not necessarily going to throw a number out there and say, what do we think we can get to. But to say we can get back to where we were from an earnings point of view as a company does not scare any of us. It's just a question of the time horizon of that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.
Adam Baumgarten: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just curious if you could give us some color on point-of-sale trends through the quarter and into July, would be helpful.
Christopher Nelson: Yes. This is Chris and nice to hear from you, Adam. Throughout the quarter as I think was mentioned earlier, point-of-sale was modestly positive. It was driven really the positive aspects were driven by an outdoor season that was more normally patterned as that season would look as well as the overperformance that we saw in DEWALT. As we finished out the quarter and the outdoor season at peak, we kind of saw them coming back more to that flattish type of perspective. And if you look at our back half, that's kind of what we think the market is going to look like in the back half as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yeah, thanks for the question. Good morning, guys.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Nicole DeBlase: Just wanted to ask about free cash flow. So Don, can you -- or Pat, can you guys talk about the cadence that you expect in the second half, given the timing shift into the second quarter. So thoughts on net working capital and other variables in the back half? Thank you.
Patrick Hallinan: Yes. We're proud of the progress we made in the front half of the year. That progress was driven both by year-over-year income improvement, but also working capital improvement. The back half of the year is traditionally the strong part of the year. So we expect the drivers in the back half to remain income and working capital, but also a bit of CapEx. And I'd say by the time we get to the end of the year, the drivers of the beat on our initial guidance are going to be a mix of working capital and CapEx. And those drivers are going to be pretty much even between those two, will be roughly on our inventory target for the year. And I would say it's going to be pretty traditionally weighted in that it's going to be pretty balanced across those two quarters with a little bit towards the fourth.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I'd be curious if you could just maybe unpack the 2Q -- the 1Q to 2Q gross margin, just given the divestment of infrastructure. I'm not sure if that was gross margin above fleet average or where that was and maybe the mix between the outdoor tool, sorry, the outdoor products versus power tools given that mega mix. Then maybe just looking at the second half of the year. You said 31%, I think, Pat. How do you think that 31% divides between 3Q and 4Q?
Patrick Hallinan: Yes. I'll start with the latter part of that, Nigel, and then I'll come back to the other first half dynamics. I'd say we're very confident in delivering our year in gross margin and taking that progression into 2025. And I think that's the most critical message we want to get across. We'll finish the year at 30%. The fourth quarter will finish in the low 30s. We would expect the fourth quarter even with some of the seasonal dynamics of the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter is going to be north of 31%. And the third quarter is probably going to be at to slightly below 31%. I'd say those are ZIP codes. But those are all being driven off of the portfolio we have right now with the bias of progress at the gross margin line in the T&O business, which has been the case throughout this year and is likely to be the case heading into next year. In terms of the dynamics across Q1 and Q2, I'd say, there's less of a dynamic that is driven by the divestiture or any other movements. I mean the divestiture was modestly dilutive in that regard, but we had anticipated that when we set up the plan and set up the guidance. And really it's been playing out across the front half of the year was the fact that we had some volume softness in the back half of 2023 that always puts a little bit of unabsorbed overhead onto our balance sheet, which is unfavorable. And against that, we were raising an acceleration of program savings, which is what we've been up against for a while now as the macro has been soft on our margin improvement journey. And we've been successful in driving savings despite the soft macro. We expect to continue doing that throughout this year and into next year. And I think the dynamics that unfolded across the quarters were really those things coming off the balance sheet, an acceleration of savings relative to some softness in the back half of '23. And I think the really -- the favorable news is even with a stronger-than-expected outdoor performance, which is welcome from a revenue standpoint, we still deliver gross margin with strength coming from a segment that has gross margins slightly below fleet average. So we feel confident with the trajectory we're on. And we expect to continue to making progress and get into the mid-30s by the end of next year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Rob Wertheimer: Yes, hi. My question is on the consumer behavior. I think we all see some of the macro back and forth in other reports and such. But I'm curious what you're seeing in your internal data just to illustrate the consumer variability or weakness or uncertainty or whatever. And how much if any risk or the upside or downside, does that kind of put into back half? What's the variability around the trends you're seeing? Thank you.
Christopher Nelson: Thanks, Rob. This is Chris. I mean we certainly have seen a continuance of the trend that we've seen where the professional is relatively stronger than the consumer. And we would expect that to continue. We have certainly, as you would expect in this environment, seeing consumers respond much more favorably to promotions, and that's good for us because we're -- we have an opportunity as we get back up to our normal run rate on promotions to benefit from that and benefit with accretive business. So we feel good about that and what we see from the opportunity with our merchandising in the back half. As far as what we see looking forward, I mean, it's going to be an uneven environment as we go forward. And we're going to stay really focused on our mission to execute against the supply chain transformation as well as we know the things that we're investing in with our major brands and specifically targeting the professional provides us some upside to the market that we're going to continue to stay diligent as we pursue. So we're excited about where we're heading and do see that dynamic that you referenced with the consumer.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the results. Just wanted to dial in a couple of areas, if I could. First, just to get a better understanding of it looks like a slight reduction of the midpoint of organic sales growth for the full year to down 50 basis points from maybe flattish before. And it would appear, correct me if I'm wrong, that perhaps you're also looking for tools and storage to go slightly negative again in the back half. So I just wanted to understand the drivers of that and if I'm correct on the back half. And then secondly, you also mentioned SG&A, mid-21% and maybe going to the higher end of the $300 million to $500 million in reinvestment. I was wondering if you had any early view on what 2025 SG&A could be given those comments around higher reinvestment into the business.
Patrick Hallinan: Hey, Mike, it's Pat. Yes, I think you're reading the year right. We had a growth quarter. We're very proud of driving a growth quarter in a very soft macro. The drivers of that were, I'd say, more traditional outdoor season, especially at retail and especially with electric products and outdoor. DEWALT posted its fifth consecutive quarter of growth. And then we had a strong aero through the -- we had strong aero performance throughout the quarter. And auto didn't really start trailing off until late in the quarter. Our expectation for the back half and we're just trying to be clear eyed about the back half. We're not here to break some big new macro news. It's just we expect DIY to stay soft. It's been soft and now we're heading into the holiday period where that's more consequential. Auto, we started trailing off in the second quarter, the latter parts of the second quarter. We expect that to remain soft. And so that's it's really driving the back half. But you would be correct in interpreting the fact that we expect the T&O business to be down slightly in the back half kind of roughly averaging down 100-ish basis points across the back half really on the backs of a soft consumer during a holiday period and the fact that the outdoor season has mostly run its course. And then in Industrial, we expect aero to remain strong, but we do have some auto headwinds baked into that which has that business to slight growth, but less robust than would have otherwise been the case had auto not trailed off. The SG&A for the year is going to be slightly above 21%, I would say, for the year. As far as next year, I mean, we're not here to kind of give '25 guidance. I don't expect SG&A as a percentage of sales next year to depart from this year in some meaningful way. All we were trying to signal is that we really believe this is a growth business and we're going to invest behind growth and we're going to protect growth investments. And so Chris and his team and the broader organization is working to put growth behind the most promising elements of our business and even in a soft macro to protect those investments, but we're not trying to telegraph some meaningful departure of SG&A as a percentage of net sales this year or next.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Patrick Hallinan: Good morning.
Christopher Nelson: Good morning.
Joe Ritchie: So I've got a near-term and a longer-term question. On the near-term side, the commentary around getting to gross margins of approximately 31% by the third quarter, can you maybe just parse that out a little bit. If I look at things historically, it tends to be a seasonally lighter quarter and you typically don't see that much improvement 2Q to 3Q. And so I'd love to hear a little bit more about that. And then just the longer-term question is really more around like getting comfort with the timing of an eventual like volume inflection. And specifically like is there a way that you guys are tracking a replacement cycle and ultimately when we could see the timing of an inflection? Thank you.
Patrick Hallinan: Hey, Joe, it's Pat. I'll start with the first one. I think reading our gross margin progression across time during this transformation has been complex because there's been so many factors in motion and some of them are what I would call atypical factors of when does expensive inventory come off the balance sheet. I would say the read of gross margin across fiscal 2024 is more a factor of it took a bit more of our savings in the latter part of '23 and the early part of '24 relative to soft volume to generate the gross margin improvement that we saw. And we had to accelerate savings throughout the latter part of '23 and throughout this whole year in a soft macro environment to get to our originally stated gross margin objectives throughout this whole journey. So Don and team laid out a road map in the latter part of 2022 that had us ending 2024 at roughly 30% and the fourth quarter in the low 30 percentile. But that was on a much, much more robust market and volume assumption. We're probably almost $1.5 billion in revenue down from that original 2022 assumption. So we've been accelerating savings to drive gross margin improvement. So the tick up from the first half of this year to the back half of this year has more to do with the savings cadence relative to longer-term margin dynamics than any kind of traditional seasonal dynamic.
Christopher Nelson: All right. And for the second one, I think what I -- this is Chris. What I would say is that, first and foremost, we really like the end markets that we serve and we like them in the long-term. And we think that there's, as Don referenced, some really nice long-term GDP plus growth potential in those markets. But whether -- especially when you're talking about the professional and it's linked to whether it's residential or commercial and industrial construction. But I think it's safe to say that whether it's professional or the consumer, which you could argue, partially driven by repair and remodel are all fairly interest rate sensitive businesses, and that would be the precursor to what we think would be -- start the inflection point. And while it wouldn't be instantaneous, we think that is kind of the first thing in the cycle we'd want to see change that would then start to unlock some of that longer-term potential that we do see for those end markets that we serve.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Thanks, Shannon. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously please contact me if you have further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-01 23:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. 
 [Operator Instructions] 
 Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin. 
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 First Quarter Webcast. Here today, in addition to myself is Don Allan, President and CEO; and Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO.
 Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today.
 This morning, Don, Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views.
 Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risks and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.
 I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan. 
Donald Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent, solid execution, and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy.
 We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022. 
 Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024. And $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey, our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results.
 Specifically, we have captured $1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024, consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations.
 We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months. As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20%, which is predominantly our cyclically-depressed outdoor business and the rapidly-recovering aerospace fastener business.
 We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as wide-body plane production continues to recover.
 Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability, coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example, our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers, which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand. 
 We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates, earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023, Ace Hardware named CRAFTSMAN as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award.
 Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners. It's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance, we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy, we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth, profitability, and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.
 Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down a point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business, organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and the DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. 
 Adjusted gross margin was 29%, up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs.
 We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50, up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation.
 On April 1, we completed the sale of Stanley Infrastructure Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt, demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet.
 Looking forward in 2024, we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses. and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins, deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time, we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.
 I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance. 
Christopher Nelson: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, First quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion, down 1% organically versus prior year, as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand, which pressured volume.
 Pricing was relatively flat, consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter, a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions, which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain in organic growth. 
 Now turning to the product lines. Power Tools was up one point organically led by pro-driven growth into DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high-margin DEWALT cordless, Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand.
 Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data, which showed an early start to the season versus prior year.
 We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last 2 years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays.
 The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory, which pressured shipments in the quarter. We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier, the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. 
 Consistent with our overall strategy, our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment.
 Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically, driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe, organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the U.K.
 We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate, all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter, driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America, Brazil, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter.
 In summary, for Tools & Outdoor, we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro, while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands, market activation, and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to long-term shareholder returns.
 I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and Engineered Fastening volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure.
 Within the Industrial segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains, particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening.
 Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1%, an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year, driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity. This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team, I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year.
 Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions, which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20V MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode, ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.
 DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20V MAX cordless 2.25 peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool, a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site.
 Additionally, our ToughSystem 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps pros maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. 
 These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive. We believe these innovations, coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary, we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and Stanley.
 Thank you, and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan. 
Patrick Hallinan: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately $145 million pretax run rate cost savings in the period, bringing our aggregate savings to approximately $1.2 billion since program inception.
 As we focus our portfolio, streamline our business structure and transform our operations, our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment, we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pretax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pretax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.  
 Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components, finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program, which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. 
 A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming, which are more event-driven, will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.
 We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025.
 The manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production, and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter, which affected 5 sites with the goal to complete these site modifications this year regarding product platforming, this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family, which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.
 In aggregate, our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024, improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. we remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater, while enabling targeted growth investments. 
 Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter, our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately $360 million, where we've traditionally averaged a roughly $700 million increase in the first quarter of the year. Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days, an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days.
 We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close, it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet.
 We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024, we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEx is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million, which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives. These items, combined with organic cash generation, support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million, which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year.
 Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent. Investing in organic growth and our transformation, funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. 
 Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year, driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs.
 We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024, and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year. We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth.
 Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered, we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50.  
 We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level, we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.
 Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets, and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. 
 Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits, most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive.
 Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed, we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024. These are designed to accelerate innovation, market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and Stanley brands.
 This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor.
 Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year, supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year, also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.
 Our adjusted EPS range remains $1, with variability in market demand being the largest contributor, we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty, while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth.
 Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pretax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million, largely relating to the supply chain transformation program, with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs.
 Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024, with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.
 Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25%, with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile.
 In summary, we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion, cash generation, balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation.
 With that, I will now pass the call back to Don. 
Donald Allan: Thank you, Pat. As we report another quarter of progress, our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve, we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands. particularly DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2 to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools & Outdoor and Engineered Fastening.  
 We are focused on consistent execution, while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth, profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. 
 With that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis. 
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]  
 Our first question is from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. 
Julian Mitchell: Maybe just my question would be around the second quarter, just honing in on that a little bit. I guess, just to make sure, based on the seasonality comment and I think the low 30s tax rate, are we sort of thinking it's flattish sequential revenue in Q2 and then a kind of 9% operating margin?
 Just wanted to make sure that's the broad assumption and to check what you're assuming for Outdoor? And also for Q2, how we think about free cash. Is that sort of flattish year-on-year or still down year-on-year like in Q1? 
Patrick Hallinan: Yes. Julian, I'll try to unpack all of those, see if I can remember them. I think you starting with sales. I think sales will be flat to slightly down fractionally down. I don't think there'll be -- the first quarter was down about one point, it probably won't be that steep.  
 And your OM margin of 9-ish percent, you're in the ZIP code. I think the first half of the year seems to be playing out in a manner that's consistent broadly with the consensus from our original guide. And so I think that's all in the ZIP code.
 In terms of cash, yes, I think cash will be up -- flat to slightly up for the quarter. What I'd remind everybody about cash is this year, our cash output is going to be driven differently than last year.
 Last year, we took out $1 billion plus of inventory, and that was a massive driver of '23 cash flow. We'll still be using inventory to drive cash flow this year, but it will be more like $400 million to $500 million.
 And then income expansion through margin expansion will drive the balance. And so we'll have the producers of cash this year be roughly the same order of magnitude, but disproportionately driven by operating profits this year. And so obviously, those operating profits are going to flow the way the quarterly revenue and the margin expansion flows. 
 And so I think that's what's being observed here in the first quarter is we had a really nice organic cash flow in the first quarter, but we had, as expected, less inventory reduction, and that's the net delta year-over-year in the first quarter, but I think it will be more like flat to slightly up when we get the second quarter versus last year.
 In terms of Outdoor, as Chris mentioned in his comments, we've seen a more traditional timing and order of magnitude start to the outdoor season, which is certainly welcome, and hope carries throughout, but it's early in the season, and we'll see where that plays out through the balance of the season, but coming off of two pretty tough seasons, we would welcome that. And so obviously, if that continued, that would put Outdoor on a growth trajectory. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. 
Timothy Wojs: I was just hoping maybe you could expand a little bit on the DEWALT growth. Just maybe some color on the underlying drivers of growth there, just whether it's kind of organic user kind of growth and expansion or just inventory availability or Outdoor, just some color there and maybe the sustainability of the growth trajectory. And then maybe just as you think about SG&A reinvestment this year, just how much are you specifically looking at kind of reinvesting that into DEWALT specifically versus some of the other brands? 
Christopher Nelson: Well, thanks a lot, Tim. This is Chris. So first of all, I'd say that we're we are encouraged by what we're seeing from DEWALT on the growth side. And it was something that has been a continued bright spot in the portfolio, and we expect it to continue to gather momentum.  
 If I would think about where the sources of growth are coming from, I would say that, first and foremost, the progress that we've made as a part of our supply chain transformation and allowing higher fill levels and service rates for our customers is certainly driving more momentum there.
 Secondarily, I think if we think about the ongoing sustainability and trajectory of that growth, as we have been pivoting our dollars and investments into more of the pro-driven end user, not only product development but also engagement in the marketplace and really highlighting the DEWALT brand, I think that, that is something that we see as a long-term sustainable trend and actually something that we're going to continue to put a lot of those investments into.
 And while I'll turn it over to the path of specifics, what I'd say as far as the investments and where they're going, really, if you think about it, we're -- the majority of it is going into development -- product development and activation, where we're saying we want to be making sure that we're developing the innovative products for our professional end users, specifically driving a lot of innovation in DEWALT.
 And then also, having a significant amount of that investment going into activation resources that can work with our end users and our partners in the field to make sure that they are able to understand launch and drive the success of those products as well. So we feel very good about the sustainability and we're encouraged by the progress we're making with this -- with the way that we're prioritizing here. I don't know, Pat, if you wanted to add anything there? 
Patrick Hallinan: Yes. I mean I think in terms of SG&A for the year, Tim, I think it's 21% in kind of the middle fractions, 21.5-ish plus or minus 20 basis points is kind of where SG&A is for the year. And as our opening comments mentioned, that's about $100 million of incremental investment. I'd say $60 million to $70 million of that in the Tools & Outdoor business. And as Chris mentioned, A lot of that is on innovation. And therefore, a healthy portion of that goes to DEWALT. And a lot of it is on field activation and so again, because DEWALT is the biggest brand out in the field, a lot of that ends up going to DEWALT. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. 
Jeffrey Sprague: Big picture question for Don and then maybe just some loose ends for Pat. But first, just -- sorry if I missed it at the beginning, but the after-tax proceeds on infrastructure, and then Pat also, can you just address what that other was in cash outflow of $250 million-ish in the quarter.  
 And Don, I'm just wondering if you could speak maybe to the portfolio now more broadly with infrastructure, Don, as kind of the portfolio simplification in your view, behind the company now, and we're focused on these operational elements that remain central to the margin improvement plan or are there other things that maybe could happen here as you chart the path forward? 
Donald Allan: Sure, Jeff. Pat, maybe you take those questions and I'll answer Jeff's second question. 
Patrick Hallinan: Jeff, the after-tax proceeds on the infrastructure deal, I'd say the pretax are in the our 730-ish range. 730, 729 a fraction. And the tax impact to that will be de minimis, probably in the 10% or less range when is all said and done. And that all went down to pay the commercial paper balance down. And that all happened in the front of the second quarter.
 Therefore, it's in the second quarter financials that you'll see 90 days down the road. In terms of other cash outflows, that is driven by, let's say, 2 things predominantly. There's many things in that bucket. One is a return to normal MICP or annual compensation, variable compensation payments, which go out in the first quarter.
 You can imagine 2022 was very, very low by traditional standards. And so the payout for '22 that happened in '23 was very low by traditional standards. And the payout that happened in the first quarter of this year for '23 was kind of back to normal standards and then cash taxes. Those are the 2 big drivers of that outflow in the other bucket. 
Donald Allan: Thanks, Pat. And so on the portfolio question, as we all know, we've done a fair amount of work of pruning the portfolio of businesses here at Stanley Black & Decker, in particular, the Security segment, which had 2 businesses. And then in Industrial, we've done some things related to not only infrastructure, but oil and gas a little while back as well. 
 We will continue to evaluate other things to prune going forward based on value creation opportunities. I think we've gotten ourselves down to a place where we have some very high-quality assets in our portfolio. And there's not an urgent need to do anything at this stage. 
 As we look at the portfolio going forward, there will be more opportunities likely in the next 18 to 24 months to do a little bit more pruning. Some of it could actually be in Tools & Outdoor as we put more and more emphasis on the 3 big brands that Chris has talked about in a couple of different settings over the last 6 months. And we'll look at some of the smaller assets we have and decide whether those make sense for it to be part of the portfolio over the long term.
 And so we will continue to be active. I think we've demonstrated over the years that pruning the portfolio is something that is important to do. but you need to do it in a way that creates value for your shareholders. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. 
Michael Rehaut: I wanted to just kind of dial in a little bit more on how you're thinking about the demand trends playing out for the rest of the year in Tools & Storage. You have 1Q organic revenue growth down 1%. You're talking about the full year flat to maybe down a little bit as the most likely scenario. So are we to assume kind of the current trend more or less persisting through 2Q and the back half? And I'm also curious about how in the first quarter, you had the 7% drop in hand tools and storage, if there was any inventory destocking or anything going on that drove that adjustment? 
 Separately, if I can sneak in another one on the mid-21% SG&A, if that's something where just given the backdrop and your goals around share gains over the next couple of years, if we should think about that as a sustainable rate over the next 12, 18, 24 months? 
Patrick Hallinan: Mike, this is Pat. I'll take your kind of balance of the year revenue flows and SG&A, and then I'll let Chris expand on a few things. I think as you think of year-over-year revenue for the balance of the year, I think any given quarter is going to be in that down 50 to down 200 basis points across the quarter, probably averaging down 1-ish for the year, if I had to kind of point you in a direction for the balance of the year.
 And any one of those quarters, the difference probably more to do with year-over-year comps and promotional activity or currency then some really noteworthy demand dynamic that we're expecting to change from one quarter to the next.
 I'd say in terms of the SG&A at kind of 21.5-ish percent, I think that's likely where we are in a year like this where we're being thoughtful to manage expenses across our enterprise, while preserving growth investments to still deliver profit and cash on our transformation journey. And I certainly think, as you look longer term, that could be a sustainable percentage as well. 
 We have talked about in a number of forms over the last year or 2 that once we start seeing the market growth and we're a bit farther down the AGM journey, we may choose for a period of time to take that percentage to 22% or potentially even a little above 22% for a while as we invest for growth on the backs of a little more gross margin and macro demand. We're not quite there yet.
 So I think kind of managing in that 21% and a fraction range for this year and for the long term is probably a decent modeling assumption. But like we've said, we may choose at periods of time to go to 22% plus when we feel that there's good returns for those growth investments. 
Christopher Nelson: Yes. So if I take a step back and talk a little bit about where we see the markets from a macro perspective for the year. I think that what we're talking about is within it's a very tight range, up a point, down a point, and we're kind of thinking that we're trending towards.
 And there are specific areas that remain tepid, specifically, if we think about we've talked about the challenges in the outdoor market. We're encouraged by what we're seeing early. But we haven't hit the season yet for really any of our businesses. And specifically in outdoor.
 And then as is widely understood, the DIY and in some areas, general construction remains a little bit muted as well. That being said, we do see some bright spots as we look at the professional markets and as the earlier conversation, as we hone in on where we're going to really look for driving share and investments, a lot of our opportunities are there. So we remain optimistic there.
 I would just say, although there are certainly scenarios that you could see some level of back half acceleration, we think it's prudent to be looking at the outlook that we discussed earlier. Because really, if you think about it, a lot of our businesses are fairly interest-rate-sensitive and with the current environment and how we're thinking about what we see for residential, construction as well as renovation there certainly will be an unlock coming. I think it's just a matter of timing. And we think it's prudent to be looking at more of that flattish revenue environment for those reasons. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. 
Nigel Coe: So I just want to come back to the Jeff's question on the portfolio. I don't think that perhaps the industrial businesses -- with the remaining Industrial businesses, the fastening businesses were trending as more noncore. It doesn't sound like that's necessarily the case. So that's my primary question. 
 But if I could just add on to that. Just want to confirm that the Infrastructure business have been the guide for 1Q. And then the stranded costs from that -- from the Infrastructure businesses is that impacting the margin progression with balance of the year? Is that material? Do you need to consider that? 
Patrick Hallinan: Nigel, this is Pat. I'll take the infrastructure and then pass it back to Don on portfolio.
 The infrastructure sale in April was always in our guide. And so our original guide and our current guide account for a very early April sale of infrastructure, which we always assumed was going to be in our Q1 results as a continuing operation and then out of our results effectively from April 2 or thereabouts on.
 And so there's nothing to adjust in the guide. The guide is the guide. And the -- we planned our cost structure this year to deal with the fact that there would be fixed cost in the Industrial business that had previously been supporting that business.
 And the Industrial team has been doing a great job, both gaining share in the remaining businesses they have, especially in auto and aero and managing their cost structure proactively to deliver roughly flat margins on the year, maybe slight improvement even though they had a sizable business to part this year. 
Donald Allan: Yes. And the question on the portfolio, Nigel, and specifically around industrial. So what we're left with after the sale of Infrastructure is the Engineered Fastening business that we acquired with Black & Decker a few other fastening businesses we acquired since then. And then, of course, CAM, the Aerospace Fastener business is in there as well.
 When we look at the different portions of that, One, there's pieces that certainly could be evaluated for the word I use pruning in the future in the next 18 to 24 months, and we will continue to look at that.
 The overall platform of Engineered Fastening is still a very substantial portion of Stanley Black & Decker. It contributes a significant amount to the EBITDA, to the cash flow of the company. And as the Tools & Outdoor portion of the business, the company continues to improve and EBITDA continues to grow as we improve our gross margins back up to 35% or more.
 As we get back to gaining market share and organic growth in a much more substantial way, it will provide us more flexibility further down the road to decide ultimately what do we do with the entirety of the Engineered Fastening business.
 But I think if you think about it in chunks of time in the next 18 to 24 months, there's probably opportunity to do a little pruning in industrial. And then beyond 24 months, it's a question of do you do something more substantial from a capital allocation point of view? Time will tell. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. 
Adam Baumgarten: Just a question on POS, what you saw throughout the quarter and into April at this point. 
Christopher Nelson: So POS was, I'd say, in Q1, it was negative, but in line with our plan or largely in line with our plan. And we remain fairly confident in supporting the outlook that we have for the balance of the year. 
 As noted, we have seen some progress and pick up with a little bit earlier start to the season from the outdoor perspective that as of late has given a little bit more strength to POS and what we're trying to see now is how much of that carries through and how that continues to ramp up as we get further into the season.
 But the highlight would be that we're fairly in line with projections from what we're seeing with POS, and we're encouraged with the areas of progress we're seeing from some nice movement on growth with some of our key brands. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. 
Joseph O'Dea: Just wanted to ask on Outdoor and as you see a more traditional start to the season, just any context on how you're thinking about 2024 demand in outdoor relative to 2019, trying to understand whether this is a return to a more normal demand environment? 
 And then also thinking about what a normal environment means for Outdoor margins relative to where we are today to appreciate how much margin upside there could be there on just volume coming back. 
Donald Allan: Yes. So there's a lot of good questions in there related to the Outdoor business. And as a commentary on the margin, the -- I would say that in my presentation, we talked about 80% of the company being above kind of line average right now, at or above. And the other 20%, which is really made up of Outdoor and CAM or Aerospace Fasteners.
 The outdoor portion of the business, yes, it is below line average, but there's an opportunity to do a couple of things. One, right now, we're really adjusting the cost base for the new demand environment of what we've experienced over the last 12 to 15 months and dramatically lower demand in Outdoor, that's taking place over the next quarter or 2.
 The second phase of this will really be looking at some of the pruning activities that I described, what portions of the business do we want to be and which portion do we not want to be in. We think that the path to continue to improve the profitability of Outdoor. And that's something we'll continue to focus on over the coming quarters and into next year.
 As far as the more detailed questions, I don't know if Pat or Chris, if you want to grab that? 
Patrick Hallinan: Yes. I'd say on the volume, this year is certainly still going to be down substantially versus 2019 even if the shape of the trend line starts and starts to look more like a normal trend line. The absolute volume in dollars will be down substantially from 2019. And I would still say that most likely next year would be below 2019 as well, but starting to recover.
 And to Don's comment the big headwind in this business has been the volume retrenching more than we would have anticipated a year or 2 ago. And so a lot of our actions are both around the fixed cost base and then what we can do with product cost structure to drive profit improvement in that business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. 
Nicole DeBlase: Maybe just focusing on pricing a little bit. I think the original expectation was for a price to be kind of slightly negative in Tools & Outdoor in the first half, and it looks like maybe it came in a bit better than that in the quarter. 
 So can you just talk about the expectation for price for the rest of the year as well as what you guys are seeing from a competitive perspective? 
Christopher Nelson: Yes. This is Chris. So Nicole, I'd say overall, what we're looking at for the year is price/cost neutral. And if we look at all the -- we try to sum up all the basket of goods and input costs we have, I'd say that we're -- we're looking at what would be a mildly inflationary environment, but we're going to be price/cost neutral in that environment. 
 And as I take a little bit of a broader lens on that from a price cost perspective. I think it's important to remember that we had a pretty unique set of circumstances in 2022, where we were really hitting the peak of some historically high inflationary environments as -- and those input costs were going up significantly as our volume was peaking and starting to retrench.
 So if I take a broader look and a longer duration, we've still kind of only recouped 85-ish percent of that overall cost that we've absorbed. So we're certainly working on making sure that we can improve our pricing processes to be more quickly reactive to inflationary environments as well as more importantly, driving innovation so that we can be putting products in there that earn because of their differentiation accretive margin rates.
 And then as I think about the competitive environment that we're seeing, thus far, we're seeing a stable environment. We're continuing to look at getting back to, and are more back to historical promotional levels, but that's healthy. And we're looking at those promotions in some important categories to us. 
 And specifically, we've talked about the importance of being able to be promoting our cordless DEWALT products. So we feel comfortable where we are, and we think that the environment remains stable. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. 
Robert Wertheimer: I have another question on the Outdoor side. I think you made positive comment on market share for DEWALT, I suppose more on the tool side. 
 I wanted to hear how you think you're positioned on breadth of portfolio and status of innovation, et cetera, on Outdoor? Do you need more investment to kind of achieve the same share gain? What do you think the season hold?
 And then it may be very early for the second part of the question, but any split on big ticket versus small ticket in Outdoor? Just budget sensitivity among your customers? 
Donald Allan: So I think that we feel well positioned with our outdoor portfolio. And I think, as I've stated previously is what we're really wanting to do is make sure that we're driving the prioritization of our innovation dollars into the categories that we think that we have the biggest opportunity for share gain as well as that are margin accretive.
 And specifically, we've been really looking at growing our presence in the outdoor handheld electric market. And that's showing great lines of progress. And I would say that we're -- year-to-date, we're feeling good about where we are from a market perspective. And with some of the listings that we've picked up, we feel good about where we are trending from a share perspective as well.
 As far as bigger ticket versus small ticket, certainly, in today's environment, we've seen that there are some levels of hesitation from the consumer and from any end user in the bigger ticket items. And we'll continue to monitor that.
 But like I said earlier, we're cautiously optimistic with how the season is starting, and we're going to continue to make sure that we're driving innovation into those areas that we believe are going to be important and accretive for us in the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. 
David S. MacGregor: I guess I just wanted to ask a question relating to progress on supply chain transformation and specifically tariffs. And can you just talk about what's changed in your sourcing and procurement operations since the -- around on tariffs? 
 And if hypothetically, I guess if all of the import tariffs that were imposed back and I don't know, 2017, 2018 when all that was going on, if they were all reimposed tomorrow, how much different would your total tariff expense be versus what you reported last time around? 
Donald Allan: Sure. So I'll probably have a little PTSD thinking about tariffs back in 2016. But if we go -- maybe do a little bit of history here. So we experienced about $300 million of tariffs back in that time frame and made substantial production moves in response to that, which mitigated it down probably to about $100 million, maybe a little less than $100 million. And that $100 million or so was offset by price increases in the marketplace.
 Those tariffs are still in place today and have not changed even in the new administration or Biden administration. As we think about potential changes in the future, that could occur if there's a change in the administration in early '25.
 The landscape for us has changed. So back in that timeframe, things that came -- that were sold in the U.S. that were made in China was about 40% of the U.S. revenue. Today, it's closer to 20%, 25%. So it's substantially lower. 
 And as we continue to drive our supply chain transformation, I mentioned on the call last quarter, that we continue to build out what we call centers of excellence for manufacturing that are in different geographies around the world. Some of them will be in Asia, not necessarily in China, but in other parts of Asia. Some are being built or have been built in the Americas and some in Eastern Europe. 
 And we will continue to build upon that, to try to -- if something changes with tariffs in '25 or beyond, we will be able to mitigate that through supply chain moves or actions. At the same time, we likely -- if that occurs, we'd likely have to do some surgical price actions as well as another lever to address. So we continue to build on the plans of what we could do or would do as we head into '25. We've started that planning about 3 months ago, and we will continue to work on that. The good news is it's really embedded more into the supply chain transformation program than it is some separate activity that we're looking at. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. 
Eric Bosshard: A follow-up, if I could. Hand Tools down 7%. I'm just curious, a little bit more color there. And then also as you think about where retail inventories are now and the path forward, what retailer's mindset is about inventories and what they're ordering relative to what they're selling. 
Christopher Nelson: So I'll start with the second question, first. As far as our inventories in the retail channel, we're at -- essentially at historical levels, if not in some areas, a little bit below. So we're seeing a pretty good direct read on the correlation between what we see in POS and what we see going in from sales. And I think that's a good position to be in. And we're like we said, we're on relatively on plan for what we're seeing from POS. 
 As far as Hand Tools, I would say that there's nothing that's a tremendous outlier there. I would say that there are some parts that are in the Hand Tools and Storage business that are, to the earlier comments, some larger ticket buys. 
 And those have been more sensitive in the short term to some of kind of the consumer environment. But overall, we feel good about where that business is tracking. Good about the POS as well, and as well the inventory levels are similar to what we've seen across the business. 
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. 
Dennis Lange: Thanks, Shannon. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, just please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-01 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2023 fourth quarter and full year webcast. Here today, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO; Chris Nelson, COO, EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don, Chris and Pat will review our 2023 fourth quarter and full year results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcasts, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.
Don Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Stanley Black & Decker's performance in 2023 reflects our relentless focus on the execution of our strategic business transformation, which resulted in us building a strong foundation for improved profitability in 2024. Stanley Black & Decker today is a more streamlined business, built on the strength of our people and culture, with an intensified focus on our core market leadership positions in Tools & Outdoor and Industrial. Despite a challenging market backdrop, that pressured volumes during the year, adjusted gross margin improved in each quarter and we generated over $850 million of free cash flow. These results demonstrate significant progress against two of our most important areas of focus during 2023. Here are just a few additional examples of our accomplishments from the past year. We improved the health of our cost structure as a result of the momentum from our supply chain transformation. We achieved our 2023 target and delivered over $1 billion of savings program to-date. We remain on track for the expected $2 billion of savings targeted by the end of 2025. Our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin approached 30%. This result outperformed the plan, as our teams accelerated efforts to deliver profit and cash in response to the soft volume environment. Our strong free cash flow generation was primarily the result of $1.1 billion of inventory reduction, as we successfully executed our supply chain initiatives. We continue to actively manage our portfolio of businesses. In December, we announced the agreement to sell our Infrastructure business, and currently expect that transaction to close at the end of the first quarter. This aligns with our simplification efforts and focus on shareholder value creation, while advancing our capital allocation priorities. We strengthened our leadership team with the addition of three new highly-capable seasoned and respected leaders in Chris Nelson, Pat Hallinan and John Lucas, each of whom brings a fresh and exciting set of perspectives. Stepping back, over the past year-and-a-half, we have transformed Stanley Black & Decker into a different company, refocused and reenergized. Together, our talented and motivated leadership team, along with our diverse and high-performing associates across the globe, are executing our transformation strategy with urgency and diligence to ensure we continue to achieve our goals. Our performance to-date is encouraging and reinforces our confidence in making investments to pursue the compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets that we serve. Shifting now to our fourth quarter performance. Revenue was $3.7 billion, which was down mid-single digits versus the prior year, primarily due to lower outdoor and DIY volume as well as infrastructure customer destocking. Our profitability exceeded our plan as we recorded adjusted gross margin of 29.8% in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was up over 10 points versus the prior year and improved 220 basis points versus the third quarter. As a result of our focused efforts, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we delivered sequential adjusted gross margin improvement. We also reduced inventory by $240 million this quarter, which brings our total inventory reduction to $1.9 billion since mid-2022 when we began this journey. 2024 will be the next chapter of transformation, an opportunity to demonstrate our ability to further improve profitability and cash flow, as we plant the seeds for future growth and success for Stanley Black & Decker. While it will be a transitional year, we are continuing to strengthen our foundation to create greater future earnings power. We will remain focused on delivering differentiated product innovation through our portfolio of world-class brands, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control, and driving share gain in our core markets, all aimed to improve margin, earnings and cash flow. Turning to the markets we serve, our view is that these markets will remain dynamic in 2024. Overall, we expect relative strength and demand from professional tools and portions of our industrial markets. However, we believe the consumer and outdoor demand trends will continue to be weak. Together, this results in a modestly negative outlook in aggregate for all of our markets. Our global trade weighted GDP estimates are slightly positive, with US Real GDP growth projected to slow, but remain positive in 2024. Global commercial construction is expected to moderate, and industrial tool markets are expected to remain supportive. The global industrial fastener end categories will be led by aerospace, while automotive and industrial production markets will be relatively flat. There are a few key macroeconomic indicators that more directly impact our larger markets in North America, which are somewhat mixed. Examples of this mix North American Tools & Outdoor market are as follows. New residential builds are forecasted to improve from current levels, yet remain modestly negative year-over-year. Residential repair and remodel is currently expected to retract. And the outdoor power equipment industry continues to show signs of customer destocking, and we don't expect to pivot to growth during 2024. In summary, we're focused on the pro user and the healthiest market segments to generate share gains. We are prepared for weak consumer and outdoor demand trends to persist. The midpoint of our 2024 plan represents a continuation of the current demand environment, which in aggregate is slightly negative for all markets. We will remain agile and ready to serve incremental demand if it accelerates in the second half. We believe that with our powerful brands and strong innovation machine, we have the opportunity to capture new wins with our customers and outperform the market. Our plan for the year is underpinned by the continued supply chain cost improvements that are broadly in our control. We expect to deliver gross margin accretion, earnings growth and strong free cash flow. Pat will discuss this in more detail in just a few moments. 2024 will be a year of focus, excitement and purpose. And it is fitting that we are celebrating the 100 year anniversary of DEWALT, a noteworthy milestone and a reminder that we have been revolutionizing jobsites for a century. We will always relentlessly innovate for our pros and all our end users, allowing them to achieve better, safer and faster results. I want to thank our 50,000-plus employees around the world for their persistence and commitment to our mission in 2023. They each have contributed to the progress we've made on our transformation journey. Now, stepping into the business segment results. I will discuss our Industrial business performance, and then pass it to Chris Nelson to review the Tools & Outdoor results. Fourth quarter Industrial revenue declined 4% versus last year. Price realization was more than offset by lower volume, which was driven by the continuation of customer destocking in Infrastructure. Within this segment, engineered fastening fourth quarter organic revenues were up 7%. This includes aerospace growth of 27% and auto growth of 10%, as we benefit from recoveries in those markets. This growth was partially muted by market softness in general industrial fastening. The fourth quarter Industrial adjusted segment margin was 11.1%, down 40 basis points versus prior year, as lower volume more than offset price realization and cost control. For the year, we are very pleased with the performance of our Industrial segment. While organic revenue growth was flat, engineered fastening, which is our focus moving forward within this segment, was up 6% organically, behind the strength in automotive and aerospace. The team delivered full year adjusted segment margin of 11.8%, up 210 basis points versus 2022. This expansion was driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity throughout the year. I want to thank the Industrial business team for their strong execution in 2023. And I'd like to especially thank the Infrastructure team for their valuable contribution to Stanley Black & Decker. I am confident that the business is positioned for a future of innovation and growth with Epiroc. I will now turn the call over to Chris to review our Tools & Outdoor performance.
Chris Nelson: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Now, turning to the Tools & Outdoor fourth quarter operating performance. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $3.2 billion, down 8% organically versus prior year as a result of lower volumes primarily from soft consumer outdoor and DIY market demand, while price remained flat. We made substantial progress improving profitability through the year, driving adjusted segment margin to 10% in the fourth quarter. This was a sequential step-up of 70 basis points versus the third quarter and 900 basis points better than the fourth quarter of 2022. We achieved this by realizing lower inventory destocking costs, delivering supply chain transformation savings and capturing the benefits of shipping cost deflation, which were partially offset by lower volume. Now, turning to the product lines. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 6%, while power tools was up 1 point organically, as pro-driven momentum offset pressures in DIY demand. Outdoor was significantly challenged as customers right-sized their inventory levels. We expect that trend to continue into the start of the 2024 selling season. In tools, we finished the year with a relatively stable market backdrop, supported by pro demand. For example, power tools organic performance improved each quarter in 2023 and exited in a growth position. This demonstrates the demand for our iconic pro-centric DEWALT brand and the best-in-class products that we are bringing to the market. As the outdoor market achieves post-COVID normalization, we are focused on improving our cost structure while prioritizing investments to capture targeted share gain opportunities with customers and accelerating innovation in handheld electrification, which is a growing and highly-profitable category. Now, turning to fourth quarter performance by region. North America was down 10% organically, with the tools product line down low-single digits. The commercial and industrial channel, which has a heavy professional user base, grew low-single digits organically. Fourth quarter US retail point-of-sale demand remained negative versus the prior year, but above 2019 levels, supported by price increases and strength in professional tools. European organic revenue was down 1%, with outperformance in the Nordics and Italy, which generated double-digit organic growth as we continue to invest in expanding our professional product offerings and activating new battery-powered innovations within the region. Emerging markets grew mid-single digits organically, excluding the impact from the Russia business exit. Including this impact, organic sales declined 1%. Solid emerging market performance was led by high-teens organic growth in Brazil, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth in the country. I want to thank the Tools & Outdoor team for their focused efforts throughout the year, which has positioned us well as we continue to focus on winning with our customers and capturing long-term profitable growth and market share. Now, turning to the next slide, I would like to now introduce our new groundbreaking equipment system, DEWALT POWERSHIFT. We are proud to bring this to market later this year as it demonstrates the company's commitment to innovation and electrification for the pros. The DEWALT POWERSHIFT system was unveiled at the World of Concrete trade show last week, and is designed to meet the critical needs of concrete professionals. The electrified line will allow the pro to transition away from gas-powered equipment without compromising efficiency and performance. Each of the six concrete tools in the system uses the DEWALT POWERSHIFT 554 watt-hour battery and high-speed charger to streamline efficiency. The battery can deliver up to 5,000 watts of continuous power, that is equivalent to 6.5 horsepower and is designed to withstand the toughest jobsite conditions. The POWERSHIFT battery leverages pouch cell technology, which DEWALT first brought to the industry in October of 2021. Pouch technology enables the cordless jobsite of the future, bringing more power, runtime and efficiency. Take, for example, the POWERSHIFT vibrator, used for concrete placement. It is 85% more efficient than gas vibrators in the market today. POWERSHIFT vibrators deliver 60 continuous minutes of non-stop work, which gives the user about 30% more runtime than a tank of gas. There are electrified vibrators in the market today that can only deliver 15 minutes of runtime. Adding to the extended runtime, this tool is 5 pounds lighter than a gas unit and is 10 pounds lighter than any other electrified unit available. DEWALT POWERSHIFT represents the next addition to the 100-year legacy of the DEWALT Innovation Mission to deliver comprehensive end-to-end workflow solutions. Raymond DeWalt's founding principles of innovation, safety and productivity remain the core ethos of our company today. DEWALT's future remains strong, and we will lead the way in empowering trades people to succeed while defining the next era of industry innovation and minimizing environmental impact. Thank you. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.
Pat Hallinan: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Turning to the next slide, I would like to highlight the progress we have achieved streamlining the business and transforming our operations. We are on track to deliver our $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings target by the end of 2025. We achieved approximately $160 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the fourth quarter, bringing our aggregate savings to over $1 billion since program inception. This performance is slightly ahead of plan as our teams accelerated savings efforts to offset macroeconomic volume headwinds that were greater than expected throughout the year, including during the fourth quarter. Strategic sourcing initiatives remain the largest contributor to our supply chain transformation to-date. In addition to the program, freight rate and demurrage savings also contributed to margin improvement starting early in 2023 and holding throughout the year. Consistent with expectations set at transformation inception, we expect strategic sourcing to be the leading contributor to savings and we expect this to be the case in 2024. Our operations excellence program continues to leverage lean manufacturing principles to improve productivity across both business segments. This workstream will expand in scope during 2024 and drive further cost efficiency in our manufacturing base. The footprint related projects are progressing on schedule and production transfers into centers of excellence are in the various stages of qualification, testing and execution. Similarly, logistics network optimization programs are also on track with regional distribution center redesigns underway. Concerning complexity reduction, our teams have identified approximately 85,000 SKUs for discontinuation and are assisting customers as they transition to replacement products. We have successfully eliminated over 45,000 SKUs as of the end of 2023 with more expected in 2024. These actions are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024, supporting the funding of additional growth investments in our core business. As we move into the next phase of our transformation, footprint and product changes, such as those from platforming, will become more important and results in a lumpier cost savings trajectory as you would expect. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater. Moving to the next slide, two of our primary areas of focus during 2023 were free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We reduced inventory by approximately $240 million in the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $100 million attributable to the Infrastructure business held for sale accounting. This brings our inventory reduction to approximately $1.1 billion in 2023 and $1.9 billion since the middle of 2022. Our disciplined inventory reduction efforts throughout the year supported $853 million of free cash flow generation, which we used to fund our dividend and reduce debt by approximately $280 million versus the prior year. We remain focused on working capital optimization in addition to improving profitability to generate significant free cash flow. In 2024, we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million, as we continue to prioritize working capital efficiency. CapEx is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million, increasing versus 2023, predominantly in support of the footprint-related transformation initiatives planned for 2024. These items, in combination with organic cash generation, underpin our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million. As a reminder, we expect a typical profile for our working capital as we build inventory for the 2024 Tools & Outdoor spring selling season, resulting in the typical first quarter operating cash outflow. Our priority for capital deployment remains consistent, making transformation investments, funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividend, and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29.8% in the fourth quarter was up 10.3 points versus the prior year, driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs, which more than offset the impact from lower volume. Adjusted gross margin finished ahead of plan as we intentionally accelerated supply chain transformation actions in 2023 while navigating weak consumer and outdoor demand and channel inventory conservatism to meet our profitability and cash flow objectives. Additionally, pricing was 0.5 point better than our expectation due to lower promotional mix in the quarter. We will continue our measured and disciplined approach to cost management to moderately improve on our second-half 2023 adjusted gross margin gain into the first half of 2024 while managing the margin pressures that accompany the outdoor selling season. This is notable given that we're able to deliver second-half 2023 adjusted gross margin 1 point above the high end of our initial '23 guidance, demonstrating the transformation is on our targeted trajectory. We are planning for adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year of 2024 and expect to exit the year in the low 30%s, consistent with prior expectations. We are leveraging our $0.5 billion of cost reductions from the supply chain transformation and working hard to navigate another year without a macroeconomic tailwind. We made significant progress throughout 2023 on our journey to restore our historical 35%-plus adjusted gross margin and our efforts are enabling incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now, let's turn to our 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. To reiterate, we are planning for 2024 to be another year where we prioritize cash flow generation and gross margin improvement. We are initiating a full year free cash flow guidance range of $600 million to $800 million, GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85, and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We expect relative strength in demand for professional tools in some of our industrial markets. Conversely, we are prepared for weak consumer and outdoor demand trends to persist. Together, these dynamics result in a modestly negative outlook in aggregate for our markets. We are planning for organic revenue to be relatively flat at the midpoint, supported by targeted share gains in our businesses. Our EPS range contemplates plus or minus 2 points of volume growth, with the variation representing the market demand scenarios in the plan. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat at the midpoint, behind our focus to win with the pro through industry-leading innovation, investments in field resources and consumer share gains, leveraging our strong portfolio of brands. The Industrial segment revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive organically, primarily driven by aerospace market recovery, as well as leveraging our core business model and electrification to deliver share gains. Industrial growth in 2024 is expected to be moderated by Infrastructure destocking in Q1 before the closure of the signed divestiture and expected softness in general industrial fastening markets. We will continue to invest for long-term organic growth and share gain throughout 2024 and plan to invest an incremental $100 million to accelerate innovation, market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and STANLEY brands. Our planning expectation is that SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2024 remains consistent with our recent fourth quarter, around 21%, which includes investments. Turning to profitability, we expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to improve to approximately 10% for the full year, supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year, also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to up slightly versus prior year, as operating improvement in engineered fastening is offset by the dilution from the previously announced divestiture of the Infrastructure business. For additional context around Infrastructure, our guidance assumes approximately $100 million of first quarter sales, with the divestiture closing at the end of the quarter. Thereafter, we have excluded the profit and assume the proceeds will be used to reduce our commercial paper debt balance. With these assumptions, we've established a $1 adjusted EPS range, with the largest contributor being market demand variability. We will work to optimize adjusted gross margin through our transformation program, we will manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year, given the macro uncertainty, but we will be working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to the other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million, largely related to the supply chain transformation program, with approximately 25% of these expenses being non-cash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to step-up in 2024 to 10% with the first three quarters generally in the mid-20%s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and we currently expect these to occur in the fourth quarter. Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 13% of the full year at the midpoint. The EPS for the first quarter is impacted by the tax profile I discussed earlier and a heavier contribution from interest expense associated with the expected first quarter commercial paper debt balance. Adjusted first quarter EBITDA as a percentage of the full year is expected to be over 20%, consistent with pre-pandemic history. First quarter total company organic sales growth is expected to be down low-single digits, primarily due to the same factors driving fourth quarter '23 softness. Adjusted EBITDA margins are planned to be strongly versus prior year, leveraging the carryover benefits of the program and comping the destocking period. In summary, 2024 represents another step along our transformation journey with a continued focus on gross margin and cash while targeting share gains in a stable, but tough macro environment. We believe our actions continue to position the company for long-term growth and shareholder return. With that, I'll now pass the call back to Don.
Don Allan: Thank you, Pat. We embarked on a bold transformation in the middle of 2022 to set Stanley Black & Decker on a path to drive strong, long-term shareholder returns through sustainable growth, profitability and cash flow improvement. As we report another quarter of progress, our consistent execution against our plan gives us the confidence to increase investments, supporting the acceleration of organic growth behind our most powerful brands, particularly DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, STANLEY. In the face of dynamic markets, we're focused on delivering best-in-class product innovation, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control, and driving share gain in our core markets. I am confident that we are creating a stronger and more focused company, capable of gaining market share consistently over the long term, with the best people, the most iconic brands and the highest quality innovation engine in the industry. With that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis.
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start the Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.
Don Allan: Good morning.
Julian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe just a question for me around that rate of improvement as we're going through the year, just trying to understand, I guess, particularly the gross margin delta and also on the free cash flow progression. What's the confidence that that gross margin can sort of move up sequentially as you go through the year to get to that low 30%s exit rate? And on free cash, kind of how weighted should that $700 million midpoint be to the second half? Thank you.
Pat Hallinan: Hey, Julian, it's Pat. Thanks for the questions. Our focus next year is on both of these topics, gross margin and cash delivery. And as we moved through '23 and made very strong progress on gross margin, we certainly had the benefit in '23 of that progression being the consumption of high-cost inventory off the balance sheet. So, throughout '23, you saw a very, very significant degree of progression throughout the year. Throughout 2024, we're confident in our plan and we're targeting the 300 basis points roughly of progression throughout the year. It will be back-half weighted, and part of that is the low volumes that we saw the back half of '23 and expect to see the front half of '24, but we have every confidence we're going to deliver it. And as we started talking to investors the back half of last year, we guided people to measure our gross margin progress in half year increments. And if you look at the back half of '23, we were about 28.7% for our back half of 2023 progression. And we expect to be in expansion mode the front half of '24, it will be modest in the 50-ish basis point range, and we'll be stepping up more significantly in the back half of '24 as we accelerate some of the savings efforts we have on the docket for the year quickly to offset some of the volume softness we've been experiencing in the last six to 12 months. But we have every confidence we're going to get there. In terms of cash, the main difference in cash year-over-year is really the difference in the transformation initiatives that are planned for 2024, where we're doing a bigger proportion of the footprint moves, which are going to drive more CapEx during '24 than during 2023 about $100 million, and more cash-oriented restructuring charges around $50 million. So, the big difference year-over-year in cash drivers are the restructuring agenda. If you look at the rest of the cash drivers, we're still targeting pretty meaningful inventory reduction, but less than the $1 billion that we drove off the balance sheet in '23. We're going to be in the $400 million to $500 million range. But that difference in inventory reduction is made up by a higher operating profit. So, those two things roughly offset each other and the drivers are really the difference in year-over-year CapEx and the difference in year-over-year cash restructuring charges.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open.
Tim Wojs: Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice job on the margins. Maybe just -- I have two cost questions. So, first just on investments, Pat, what are you kind of explicitly investing or at least what's planned to be invested in 2024? And how variable are you kind of planning to manage those investments as you go through the year? And then secondly, just on cost inflation, could you give us just an idea of kind of what you're seeing in kind of key cost inputs, and then also what's kind of explicitly baked in for price/cost?
Pat Hallinan: Yeah. So, on investments, we're continuing to invest predominantly in innovation and then in the field and marketing resources to activate it. So, of the $100 million we're targeting for '24, I'd say three quarters or more are around that. Obviously, a lot of that in our biggest business, our Tools & Outdoor business, but some in Industrial as well. It's mostly about innovation and market activation and field resources to support it, maybe 20% to 25% is another capability building to make us a more productive organization. And then, as we go through the year, I mean, obviously, we're going into a year with a pretty muted macro and the uncertainty we've been experiencing the last 12 or 18 months, we're certainly going to be paying close attention to the macro and managing our cost structure as we go throughout the year to be in step with that macro. But we are really focused on the long-term growth of this business, and we're going to be working hard as a leadership team and as an organization to preserve those investments, even if the macro creates a bit more headwinds than we're expecting, because we're not going to just completely collapse '24 investment at the risk of longer-term brand health and brand share gaining power. In terms of inflation and deflation for the year, our plan expects roughly flat across kind of materials and freight. You've obviously had some of the battery metals go down in significant percentage terms, but in dollar terms, those don't drive our basket as much as some others. There's been some recent upticks in steel resins, and we'll probably face some marginal pressure from Red Sea freight. But overall, you put metals and freight together, roughly flat. Still kind of a high labor rate environment, but that's embedded in our gross margin and SG&A assumptions. And then finally, price/cost, again, roughly neutral. It will have some carry-in price in Industrial, that's to the good, offset by just the normalization of promotional cadence in Tools & Outdoor. Again, recall the back half of '23, we're getting back to a normal promotional cadence as our supply chain healed and that will be playing through the front half of '24 as well. But I'd say those two forces together enterprise-wide get us to roughly flat price dynamics for the year and again a roughly flat inflation backdrop in total.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up about the flat-lining of gross margin that's expected into the first half relative to the Q4 exit rate. It seems like there is a lot of savings on the balance sheet that is yet to flow through the P&L. And I think the expectation is that those come through on a couple quarter lag. So just, maybe why is that not coming through in the first half? And I understand the outdoor mix will pick up. But I would also think that tools gross margin gets better from Q4 into the first half as you move past the holiday promo. So, any color on the gross margin delta between those product lines, to help understand that mix would be helpful. Thank you.
Pat Hallinan: Yeah. No, like I said, we do expect some modest expansion front half to front half. We had, as we went through 2023 and we saw volumes being really soft, I think commend the team for still delivering over $500 million of savings across the volume backdrop that was for the year, about 300 basis points or 400 basis points below what we expected. And we got beyond the high side of our guidance for '23 gross margin. So, we came out at quite a strong rate. As you point out, the trajectory in the first half is positive even if a bit muted. And I'd say the couple of forces of that are, one that you pointed to, you have a heavier outdoor mix in the first half of the year, and you have some of the under absorption that was associated with low volumes from the back half of '23. And those are really the two forces, and they play out in the front half by muting some of the rate of that progress, but they don't take us off-track for the full year savings.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.
Pat Hallinan: Good morning.
Rob Wertheimer: My question is on dynamics at the retail channel. And if I understood it right, you had volumes a little soft, you had promotional activity down, which is good. And I'm just curious about how that works out in market share, whether the competition is stepping up promotional activity, whether channel inventory is now normalized, there is less promotion. Maybe just give us a comment on market share, on promotions, on dynamics of retail. Thank you.
Don Allan: Sure. Thanks, Rob. I think the competitive landscape has not really shifted or changed as we went through the end of '23 into the early stages of '24. There is modest movements in certain brands moving across retailers. But aside from that, we're not seeing unusual pricing or discounting happening. And for the most part, it's really all of us navigating a somewhat muted market right now and continuing to position ourselves for share gain. But I'll ask Chris Nelson to give a little more color on what he's seeing.
Chris Nelson: Yeah. I'd say that as you think about the -- just referencing POS, I would say that the POS played out roughly as we would have planned it in Q4 where we saw it was down year-over-year but above 2019 levels. And if you think about the kind of buckets therein, we saw strength out of the pro and the expected level of -- kind of difficulties that we are going to see in the consumer and DIY segment. So, that's on plan, and it's what we're contemplating, as we said, moving into this year for that being a fairly stable macro that we're playing the backdrop against. As Don referenced, we're not seeing major changes in the competitive dynamics. What we are seeing and we're excited about is getting back to our normal promotional rhythms as we have been able to take care of our customers and fill -- our fill rates have been proved. That's made a big difference in our opportunity to compete well in retail. And then, I think the final part of your question that you referenced was regarding inventory levels. And certainly, on a global basis, as people take a look at what is somewhat of a dynamic or tepid macro, people are thinking about right-sizing their inventories for that environment, and we see that somewhat anecdotally in places like Europe and in some of our professional channels. But when you take a look at the biggest chunks of the inventory where we have really clean data in our major retailers, we're at historical levels. We feel good where we are there positioned, and we think that that's going to be kind of a neutral dynamic heading into 2024.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Believe it or not, I was actually at World of Concrete. I saw the new products. Pretty impressive I'd say. So, congrats on that launch. Just on the pricing, came in obviously better than last quarter in Tools & Outdoors. So, just wondering -- if you talked about normalization of the promotional activity and I'm just wondering if maybe you pulled back in the fourth quarter and perhaps that kind of put some of the maybe the weakness in Tools & Outdoor. But just I'd really be curious on the footprint changes you're making with the CapEx. Obviously, we've got Trump talking about China tariffs. I'm just wondering if there's going to be a material change in your sourcing and footprint during 2024.
Don Allan: Yeah. So, Nigel, I'll have Chris answer your first question, and then I'll take the second question after he's done.
Chris Nelson: So, from a pricing perspective -- Nigel, good to hear from you. I'm glad you were able to see the new products. Sorry I missed you there. But no, we did not see a significant pullback in the promotional volume. What we saw was an overall -- as we said, more challenge in the overall macro environment that I think contributed to that more than anything. And as we transition into next year, we're expecting that pricing dynamic to stay fairly stable. We feel good about our plans there. And overall, I think it's fair to say that, as Pat pointed out, we're kind of at a neutral price cost. We're not banking on a bunch of inflation. And as we take a look at in the rearview mirror, we have recouped a significant but not all of the costs we took on, as we saw inflation. And so, keeping that neutral price cost is important for our gross margin trajectory moving forward as well.
Don Allan: Yeah. The comment on the footprint, I mean, yeah, the geopolitical dynamics continue to be intriguing and interesting for sure, what may play out in the future. But as it comes to our footprint transformation, we started with an overarching strategy of finding ways to get closer to our customer with our supply base and our manufacturing [Technical Difficulty] certain types of products that are high volume, in particular. Other products, you have to focus more on the low-cost location. And so, you end up with a mixed geography of where you're manufacturing and how you're serving your customers. That hasn't really changed. What we continue to do as part of the transformation though is develop centers of excellence for power tools, certain types of hand tools, certain types of outdoor products that leverage the expertise we have in these geographies in Asia, in Mexico and in the United States and Eastern Europe. We will continue to build upon that, which gives -- eventually, will give us the ability to flex supply from different geographies if the geopolitical landscape changes radically. That will take time to do. That's not something that will necessarily occur in the next six to 12 months. But as we continue on this journey and finish this transformation in the next two to three years, that's an outcome that we're looking to achieve. And so, we believe that's the appropriate way to address what's happening in the dynamic geopolitical space, and we'll continue to evaluate that going forward as things shift in countries like the United States if they shift and make pivots as necessary.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.
Adam Baumgarten: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just on SKU rationalization, do you think that had any impact on the volumes in the fourth quarter or even the second half of '23?
Don Allan: Go ahead, Pat.
Pat Hallinan: Yeah. Adam, no, I mean, that program has been very thoughtful in weeding out complexity that's not creating value for end users or for our shareholders. And there's no major disruption by that, by any stretch of the means.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Don Allan: Good morning.
Michael Rehaut: I had a question on the growth investments and just how to think about the cadence about longer term. I think you talked about it a little bit earlier in the call, but can you talk about in totality, I think alongside the 35%-plus gross margin and enabling $300 million to $500 million of growth investment, I was hoping just to get a sense of what those investments were in '23, what you expect it to be in '24 and '25, and how much of that is going to be kind of an ongoing level of investment, and if that would all be on the income statement in the tools and storage, or if there would be some in corporate? Thanks.
Pat Hallinan: Yeah, Mike. I'll give you a few points. I'd say '23 was a bit over $100 million, will be around $100 million for '24. And as I referenced on our earlier question, it's about three quarters around innovation and then the marketing and field resources to activate that effectively. And the rest of it is around capability building. Some of it in our business segments, a relatively small amount of it in corporate. And I think if you're getting to the broader question of you're sitting there with a model and you're trying to figure out is SG&A permanently at 21% of sales or something else, if that's kind of behind the essence of your question, I'd say as we get back to share gains and as we jolt our brands and our innovation up for a few years, I expect in the medium-term, to be more in the back to the 20%-ish range, if that's kind of what you're trying to unpack. But I would expect us to be elevated in '24 and potentially in '25 and '26 depending on the macro and some of the things we're prioritizing in the medium-term around that 20%-ish level. And then, I think, beyond the medium term, to the extent we can be exceptional at driving gross margin improvement, the SG&A will move with the rate at which we can drive gross margin improvement.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.
Eric Bosshard: Good morning. You talked about normalizing promotions and you talked about, I think, volumes relative to '19, just curious if you could give us a little bit of insight into promotional activity relative to '19, where we are now, and what is embedded in the guidance, and what you're seeing in the market in regards to an appetite for promotions either from consumers, professionals or retailers?
Don Allan: Good morning, Eric. So, I would say that the level of promotional activities we're at now and we would expect in '24 is probably pretty consistent with what we experienced in 2019. And so, we're kind of back to where we were, which I think was a healthy balance of normal core operating selling activities and promotional activities. As we think about the year, our customers are not really talking to us about, what I would call, unusual levels of promotional activities. They're looking for the normal set of activities, and I think that's going to likely be the case throughout the year. And we tend to -- in demand markets like this that are somewhat stable in the sense where you don't have a lot of growth and you don't have a lot of retraction, it tends to be a more normal promotional environment in that setting. If demand retracts in a more significant way, then promotional activity does pull back a fair amount, because the impact of promotions is not as significant. If we see a back half of the year that gets better, which there's -- we talked about in our presentation that our guidance doesn't necessarily include that, but if the back-half demand environment is an improved environment, and you could potentially see a little bit of tick-up in promotional activity related to that. But at this stage, based on our guidance, I think it's probably balanced to say that our view is that promotional activity will be consistent with what we saw pre-pandemic.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-27 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2023 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker’s 2023 third quarter webcast. On the webcast in addition to myself is Don Allan, President and CEO; Chris Nelson, COO, EVP, and President of Tools and Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning’s webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don, Chris, and Pat will review our 2023 third quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It’s therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.
Don Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Stanley Black & Decker’s third quarter performance reflects the continued successful advancement of our strategic business transformation. Our focused execution resulted in improvements versus prior year in adjusted gross margin and earnings per share, as well as free cash flow. Reflecting on our journey over the last five quarters, we have made significant progress. One, our cost and inventory position is healthier behind the momentum of our supply chain transformation and we are confident in the runway for this to continue. Two, our execution is stronger and the results now demonstrate the focus across the organization to enhance the customer experience and improve our financial position. Three, our performance today provides a solid foundation for the additional investments we are launching in innovation and market activation to capture the compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets we serve. Four, our view is that the markets will remain dynamic. Our focus is on delivering best-in-class product innovation through our portfolio of world class brands, implementing cost efficiency measures within our control and driving share gain in our core markets. All aim to further improve margin, earnings and cash flow. While there are many important steps ahead of us on our journey, I am confident that we have the right strategy, a highly capable and motivated leadership team, and a strong competitive position to successfully execute our transformation. Shifting now to our third quarter performance. Revenue was $4 billion, which was down versus the prior year primarily due to lower Outdoor and DIY volume. The demand for our Pro Tools, as well as automotive and aerospace fasteners remained healthy and demonstrated growth in the quarter. Across our end markets, the U.S. retail point-of-sale for our Tools and Outdoor products remained in a growth position this quarter versus 2019 levels. As we assess our competitive positions and demand trends, we believe that we are stabilizing our share position in a mixed market environment, while we continue to invest in market activation and field resources to drive future share gains. Our Global Cost Reduction Program delivered $215 million of pretax run rate savings in the quarter, on track for the expected $2 billion run rate savings by the end of 2025. Adjusted gross margin rose to 27.6%, a 400-basis-point sequential improvement and 290 basis points favorable as compared to last year. The benefits from our inventory optimization and supply chain transformation are now clearly being reflected in our performance. As we navigate uncertain market conditions, we are continuing to focus on what is within our control to improve our margins. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect additional sequential and year-over-year gross margin gains. We delivered approximately $300 million of inventory reduction this quarter, which brings us to $1.7 billion reduction since mid-2022 when we started this journey. This contributed to over $360 million of Q3 free cash flow generation, which supported our quarterly dividend and $285 million of debt reduction in the quarter. Benefits from lower supply chain costs contributed to third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $1.05, which was better than our plan. Our year-to-date performance supports increasing our 2023 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $1.10 up to $1.40, which would be up $0.25 at the midpoint. I want to thank our 50,000 plus employees around the world for their focus, dedication and passion that contributed to another successful step forward in the third quarter. Our progress is encouraging and I am confident that by executing our strategy, we are positioning the company to deliver higher levels of organic growth, profitability and cash flow, as well as strong long-term shareholder returns. Now shifting to our third quarter segment results. I will discuss our Industrial business performance and then pass it to Chris Nelson to review the Tools and Outdoor results. Third quarter Industrial revenue declined 4% versus last year, as price realization and currency were more than offset by lower volume and a 3-point impact from our Q3 2022 Oil and Gas business divestiture. We improved Industrial adjusted operating margin by 110 basis points versus prior year, driven by continued price realization and cost actions to deliver adjusted operating margin of 12.2% in the quarter. This represents strong execution and continued year-over-year margin expansion for our Industrial team. Within this segment Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 6%, including aerospace growth of 29% and auto growth of 9%, as we continue to capture the strong cyclical recoveries in these markets, which was partially offset by what occurred in industrial fastening. Our Attachment Tool business experienced organic revenue declines, primarily as a result of customer destocking to normalize their inventory levels. The long-term fundamentals for growth remain solid in all these businesses and we believe the temporary channel inventory destocking in Attachment Tool will be complete as we exit 2023. I want to thank the Industrial business for their strong execution. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted operating margin for the segment. We are excited by the runway for growth, share gain and operating leverage in these businesses. I will now turn the call over to Chris to review our Tools and Outdoor performance.
Chris Nelson: Thank you, Don. And good morning everyone. I am now at the 4.5-month mark at Stanley Black & Decker and this period has really reinforced my excitement about the future for this business. I have spent my time with end-users, customers and our passionate and highly capable Tools and Outdoor organization. We have iconic brands such as DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, Stanley and Cub Cadet, a strong pipeline of innovation, and customers and users who are eager for our newest products. We remain focused on capturing that opportunity. We are rapidly making progress with our transformation. The organization remains committed to supporting the necessary cost efficiencies as we prioritize the additional investments in innovation, brand support and commercial resources that will be most impactful to reaccelerate growth and share gain in the market. Now turning to the Tools and Outdoor third quarter performance. Total revenue was $3.4 billion, down 5% organically versus prior year as a result of lower consumer Outdoor and DIY market demand. Our Tools SPUs in aggregate were positive organically in the quarter, excluding the Russian business exit, while Outdoor, was down 23% consistent with our expectations. Price for the segment was down 2 points in the period, as we successfully regained margin accretive cordless promotions consistent with historical activity. We made substantial progress in improving adjusted operating margin to 9.3%, this was a sequential step up of 480 basis points and 250 basis points better than last year. This improvement was driven by reduced sell-through of high cost inventory, supply chain transformation savings and reduced shipping costs, which were partially offset by lower organic revenue. In terms of performance by region, North America was down mid-single digits organically similar to the overall segment North America Tools organic growth was positive, while Outdoor declined. U.S. retail point-of-sale for the quarter remained above pre-pandemic 2019 levels supported by strength in professional demand and price. Third quarter POS for DEWALT was positive versus last year, supported by promotions, our pro-inspired new product offerings and sustain professional demand. Our European organic revenue was down 3% with bright spots from double-digit organic growth in the U.K. and low single-digit growth in the Nordics. We are leveraging targeted programs to capture professional share with DEWALT cordless tools. In emerging markets, we grew mid-single digits organically, excluding the impact from the Russia business exit. Including this impact, organic sales declined 4%. Solid emerging markets performance was led by Latin America, which is now recorded four consecutive quarters of organic growth. We have seen notable strength in Brazil, particularly within the professional channels. Moving to our strategic business unit performance. The hand tools business grew 2% organically versus prior year. This includes mid-single-digit organic growth in North America and Latin America, supported by expanded offerings at our retailers and strong new product sales. Power Tools declined 2% organically, pressured by Consumer Tools. Pro driven momentum coupled with positive impacts from a healthier supply chain is supporting enhanced service levels and promotional opportunities. Transitioning to Outdoor, organic revenue declined due to market demand choppiness as the industry resets from the pandemic era. This resulted in fewer shipments in the quarter as there are elevated inventory levels globally impacting replenishment cycles. Despite the current market environment, we are excited about the long-term opportunity and bringing leading innovation to Outdoor across our powerful brands. I want to thank the team for their strong execution in the quarter as we continue to focus on winning with our customers and capturing this amazing growth margin and shareholder return opportunity. Turning to the next slide, I would like now to highlight a few examples of how we are evolving our trade focused offerings and Cordless Outdoor expansion. With Professional Trades torque cordless impact wrench in its class, ideal for use in heavy-duty applications. We also introduced the world’s first battery charger box, The DEWALT TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 Dual-Port Charger. Users now can protect store and charge dual batteries in a durable weather resistant container to keep professional’s productive despite rough job site conditions. In Outdoor as we gear up for winter, DEWALT has entered the snow category with the 60-volt MAX Single Stage Snow Blower. Powered by two flexible batteries, it is engineered to tackle tough demands and breakdown heavy wet or pack snow. Our Pro inspired innovation roadmap will continued to introduce solutions across our categories that enhanced safety on the job site while elevating power and performance. Now changing gears into DEWALT’s new involvement with our social responsibility efforts, we are working to close the trade skills gap and shaping the future of construction technology and the electrical and plumbing trades. In the third quarter, we opened the 2023 DEWALT Grow the Trades Grant and Trades Scholarship program. These initiatives provide non-profits with the necessary resources to train, reskill and prepare tomorrow’s trades people by directly supporting end-user trade education. This is a great example of our broader commitment to invest $30 million to grow trade skills by 2027. Now I will turn the call back to Don.
Don Allan: Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the energy and perspective that you have brought to the team and I am excited to continue our company’s strategic business transformation with you as a key leader on our strong management team. Turning to the next slide, I would like to reinforce the focus areas across our company’s transformation. One, streamlining and simplifying the organization, as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our end-users and various channel customers. Two, accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return adjusted gross margin to historical 35% plus levels, while improving fill rate to better match inventory with customer demand. Three, prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization. And then four, continuing to advance innovation, electrification and global market penetration to achieve organic revenue growth of 2 times to 3 times the market. We believe this strategy will ensure our best in class product innovation is maintained, while we continue to meet or exceed the expectations of our end-users and we dramatically improved the channel customer experience. In parallel, we will maximize cost opportunities within our control to fuel investment as we deliver our margin, earnings and cash flow goals. As our margins expand, our focus is to accelerate share gains. We are prioritizing innovation and market activation investments across our powerful brands and targeting the best prospects to maximize share gain growth and return. We continue to benefit from being a simpler, more focused company across Tools and Outdoor and Industrial, and we expect over the next 12 months to 18 months, we will find opportunities for further simplification across our businesses. As we evaluate where to invest and the best ways to maximize shareholder return, we will continue to take a pragmatic view of our portfolio of businesses. Our track record demonstrates we will act decisively when the time is right on those portfolio decisions. I will now turn the call over to Pat to share the latest progress updates on our transformation, financial insights on the quarter and our revised outlook for the year. Pat?
Pat Hallinan: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. We continue to generate strong transformation results and go-forward momentum. Our cost reduction program delivered approximately $215 million of pretax run rate cost savings in the quarter. Bringing our aggregate savings to approximately $875 million since program inception. This positions us well to deliver our slightly exceed our $1 billion run rate savings target this year and to deliver $2 billion run rate savings by 2025. As it relates to the supply chain transformation, strategic sourcing initiatives remain the largest contributor to supply chain savings since program inception. The early actions focused on strategic components and logistics, as well as other areas. We have now covered approximately two thirds of the targeted procurement spend, establishing a carry on savings trajectory consistent with that contemplated in the 2024 program target. Our supply chain management and engineering teams will continue to drive sourcing improvement through 2025 and beyond. Activating our Operations Excellence program has also contributed significant savings this year. In the plants where this has been activated, we are seeing increased productivity, leveraging lean manufacturing principles. Our footprint related projects are progressing on schedule with initial savings to begin this year. As it relates to complexity reduction, our teams are assisting customers as they transition to replacement products with the goal of exiting 30,000 SKUs by the end of 2023. We are confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margins to 35% or greater. These actions are creating the flexibility to fund additional organic growth investments in our core business. Turning to our inventory reduction in gross margin improvement. We reduced inventory by approximately $300 million bringing our year-to-date progress to approximately $880 million. The third quarter inventory reduction supported the generation of approximately $360 million of free cash flow in the period, resulting in one of the strongest third quarter cash generations in the company’s history. We have reduced inventory by $1.7 billion since the middle of 2022. We achieved this through improved supply chain conditions, strategic inventory management and the planned production curtailments initiated during the back half of 2022. We expect modest inventory improvement in the fourth quarter, which would bring our full year 2023 inventory reduction to at or near our 2023 objective of $1 billion as we prepare for next year’s Outdoor season and supply chain network changes. Inventory reduction will be a major contributor to our full year free cash flow target of $600 million to $900 million. Looking to 2024 and beyond, we expect the additional multiyear inventory reduction opportunity to be at or above $1 billion. We expect to pursue further inventory reduction at the pace of $400 million to $500 million per year. We will balance our goal of inventory efficiency with ensuring sufficient working capital. Our priority for capital deployment is to fund our longstanding commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and to further strengthen our balance sheet. Shifting to profitability. We recorded adjusted gross margin of 27.6%, up 290 basis points versus prior year and improving 400 basis points versus the second quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter that we delivered sequential gross margin improvement. Year-over-year expansion was driven by lower inventory destocking costs, supply chain transformation benefits and reduce shipping costs. All of which more than offset the impact of lower organic revenue. Moving forward, we expect continued adjusted gross margin rate expansion driven by the benefits of the supply chain transformation. Our guidance calls for adjusted gross margin to incrementally improve again in the fourth quarter. Now that the high cost inventory has turn through the P&L, we expect to continue to deliver expanding adjusted gross margin into the first half and full year 2024 supported by the success of our supply chain transformation. Achieving adjusted gross margins approaching 28% in the third quarter was a significant milestone on our journey to restore 35% plus adjusted gross margin. The momentum of our supply chain transformation is translating to sustainable upward progression in our margins and cash flow, and will provide resources to fund investment to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth toward our goal of 2 times to 3 times the market. Now turning to our 2023 guidance. Our expected GAAP earnings per share range has been revised to negative $1.45 to negative $1 from negative $1.25 to negative $0.50, charges primarily from the global supply chain transformation and Outdoor business integration. The current pretax estimate of acquisition related and other charges is now $425 million to $450 million, with approximately half of these expenses being non-cash. Based on the strength of the third quarter, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $1.10 to $1.40 from our previous guidance range of $0.70 to $1.30. We delivered a strong third quarter cash performance and are maintaining our full year free cash flow target of $600 million to $900 million. We expect fourth quarter cash flow to be supported by positive cash earnings, inventory reduction and the typical seasonal receivables reduction in Tools and Outdoor. The organic growth outlook for the year is unchanged with the total company expected to be down mid-single digits. This implies a revenue midpoint of $15.9 billion for the year and includes estimated risks for auto strikes and continued infrastructure customer destocking. Turning to important remaining elements of guidance. Our expectation is for production to continue to normalize in the fourth quarter. We remain disciplined and flexible in our approach to invest, to drive organic growth and share gains. Our outlook assumes approximately $125 million of annualized innovation and market activation investment with a goal to ultimately deploy $300 million to $500 million over the next three years. We expect fourth quarter adjusted operating profit to approximate $290 million with adjusted gross margin to sequentially improve to the 28% zone both the business. With that, I will now pass the call back over to Don.
Don Allan: Thank you, Pat. We are pleased to report another quarter of progress on our journey of transforming Stanley Black & Decker. Consistent successful execution against our plan gives us the confidence to increase investments, which will accelerate organic growth behind our most powerful brands. As we continue to focus on what we can control to be successful, I am confident that we are creating a stronger and more focused company with our great people, amazing brands and industry leading end-user inspired innovation. We believe the outcome of our transformation will produce sustainable market share gaining machine. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. And great to hear that update from Chris on the momentum in the Tools business. Maybe my question just around slide nine and some of the commentary there on margins. So, I guess, one is just, it looks like the gross margins up sequentially in Q4, but sort of operating margin down somewhat. So maybe just any sort of moving parts within that worth calling out. And then you talk about the gross margin moving higher sequentially into the first half of next year. So maybe you put that in context for us in terms of what does that tell us about the confidence in that sort of $4 to $5 of EPS number that you have mentioned in the past is perhaps some kind of framework for earnings next year? Thank you.
Don Allan: Thanks for the long multiple questions there, Julian. But good questions, because there are -- the things that we are very focused on as far as our margin rate improvement we are really pleased with what occurred in Q3 and what we believe will play out in Q4. And I am going to ask Pat to give us more color on your questions around margin and then tying it into the $4 to $5 for next year, we still feel that that is a good range and potential outcome for us. And Pat will give a little more color on as well. So, Pat.
Pat Hallinan: Yeah. Hey, Julian. Our focus is going to remain margins and cash generation until we are back to the operating model that business has traditionally had. I’d say, gross margins you saw, both effects, the effects of the program driving the cost savings we expected to the tune of, one, 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter. Deflation also help in the quarter mostly from shipping coming off the balance sheet of another 100 basis points to 150 basis points. And then broader high cost inventory coming off the balance sheet of around 300 basis points. And that was our expectation. It’s great to see the teams working hard together to deliver the program on cadence, but as we have been telegraphing to investors, we could see the rate at which high cost inventory was coming off the balance sheet and that came well within our expectations and drove the important gross margin expansion. From here we have a pathway to 35%, obviously, the pathway going forward, it’s not going to be perfectly linear, but it’s certainly going to be more in the range of 50 basis points to 100 basis points a quarter on gross margin. As our operating margin question, that had more to do with just, it was about $200 plus million less revenue in this quarter and that was really the driver of the operating margin difference as we continue to invest in the business. And we are going to go forward both in the fourth quarter and as we head into a dynamic 2024 focused on continued gross margin expansion and cash generation. We are going to be investing for growth and that’s part of what we are doing in the fourth quarter and that’s what we are going to plan to do in 2024 as well. But we will be mindful of the macro environment and what that means for cash delivery and de-levering along that route. And the $4 to $5, I would say, given the performance of the business in the back half of the year in a dynamic market. I would still say, we see the $4 to $5 as a reasonable range. Certainly, it’s dependent on the macro and deflation versus inflationary environment. I would say that, the $4 to $5 anticipates a stable or improving macro. If you are at the stable side of the macro, you are probably on the lower side of the range and if you are at an improving macro, you kind of go towards the higher side of that range.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Tim Baird, your line is now open. Please check your mute button.
Dennis Lange: Tim?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and hello, Chris. Good to hear your voice again. The -- I guess, maybe a little bit of a multi partner also, but just kind of thinking about, as you pivot from just kind of outright cost reduction to reinvesting for growth and the like. Does all most of this reinvestment happened inside of COGS and the gross margin discussion. How much of it ends up kind of in selling sales force, things that you are doing on kind of developing the trades that you mentioned. And maybe just as part of that selling related question, maybe just a little bit more color on what you are seeing on promotion and just kind of the general pricing environment in the market? Thank you.
Don Allan: Yeah. Jeff, I will ask Chris to give a little more color on that. It clearly is going to be heavily weighted to SG&A and selling resources and activities. But let’s give Chris an opportunity to give you more color on that. Chris?
Chris Nelson: Yeah, Jeff. Thanks a lot. Nice hearing from you again. And what I’d say is that per Don’s comments, as we think about how we are going to move forward, and I would say, have focused investments in the business in the areas that we believe will drive the most leverage, making sure that we see which brands we want to invest in and what levers we want to pull there. And obviously, we have seen the strength of the Pro and there was we did, as far as near-term look, DEWALT was a positive story in the quarter, we need to keep on gathering steam with that. What I’d say is that, as far as in the investment buckets and where we are thinking we could have the most leverage. Certainly having the right products for the professional end-user is a large emphasis for us. We referenced a few of the launches that we have in the near-term, we are going to continue to double down on those types of investments for the Pro end-user, because of the strength of the brand, as well as what we see in the marketplace. Similarly, we want to make sure that we have the right commercial resources in the right markets on the ground with our customers, working with them on ways that we can grow together, because we really think that there is some great opportunities in the area -- in that area. So, that’s where really out of the gate, the emphasis is going to lie. As far as your other question on where we see, what we saw in the promotional activities? We are -- we did reference that we are going to be back in returning to traditional levels of promotion and we did that in Q3 and it started our quarter out strong and we are happy to be back in that promotional mindset, because it is an important part of the business and we think it is healthy and accretive for the business going forward. Now, we also are certainly going to supplement that with the new launches and we are going to lean into the new launches going into the back half of the year to continue that growth. But all in all, we are seeing the, in Q3, our sell-through was in line with our expectations. As far as pricing, we see disciplined in the marketplace as far as no deep discounting and we are going to make sure and continue in our healthy and traditional promotional mix. But then, like I said, also be driving growth organically through leaning into the opportunities that we see with the Pro.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate it. I just wanted to kind of understand some of the puts and takes on the updated guidance if I may. Kind of what really in effect drove the upside in the third quarter and it seems like, on an EPS basis year in effect reiterating the implied fourth quarter guide. I think you referenced investing in growth. I don’t know if that’s something that maybe perhaps you are increasing in the fourth quarter relative to prior expectations. But would love to understand that dynamic of what drove the 3Q upside and why you are reiterating 4Q. And also, to that point, the reiteration of the free cash flow guidance relative to the raising of the EPS guidance. What’s the bridge there as well? Thank you.
Don Allan: Yeah, Mike. Good morning. Third quarter was a strong quarter for us. Our sales came in roughly as we were expecting and we drove the EPS be on the strength of gross margin performance in SG&A management. The gross margin is a factor of the program running a bit ahead of both pace in absolute dollar generation and that drove strength in the quarter from a gross margin perspective. Our teams are managing SG&A thoughtfully in the macro environment. Also, as you know, Chris and team came on Board and spent part of the quarter kind of revisiting current and future year priorities, there was probably a bit of SG&A that will shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter that helped out the third quarter net. As we head into the fourth quarter, the topline is probably a bit softer, probably to the tune of around $100-ish million or so versus the expectations we would have had a quarter ago. Most of that is baking in the trends in Outdoors and Attachment Tools that we saw in the third quarter and also an expectation that unsettled UAW strike with at least two of the big auto manufacturers could pose some headwinds to our fastening business. So a softness in the fourth quarter at the topline slightly is one of the reasons that the guidance in absolute terms in the fourth quarter is there. And then we are investing, as I mentioned, some will be a little bit of a shift of SG&A from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, but we are at a point where we are confident in our margin and cash generation trajectory. We need to start investing for growth and we are doing that in the fourth quarter. And those two things together keep the EPS amount constant in the fourth quarter. And then on free cash flow, you are much of this year’s free cash flow is generated by working capital dynamics and much of those dynamics are continuing to play out according to plan and forecast and that’s largely why the free cash flow guide stays where it is for the year and the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open. Tim Wois, your line is open, please check your mute button. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the prior commentary of about 50 bps to 100 bps of quarterly gross margin improvement. It seems that would imply 2024 exiting up around 300 basis points year-on year at the midpoint. So, obviously, very strong growth next year. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about what that assumes from both macro and volume standpoint and also from a cost interest standpoint. I guess metal and freight maybe up? Thank you.
Don Allan: Yeah. We will give detailed 2024 guidance at the end of the year when we do our fourth quarter. But I can point in a few directions, especially around the gross margin, because it’s such an important point of our progress and where our focused energy is. I think on a full year basis for 2024, we would expect full year gross margins around 30%, potentially a little bit higher than 30%, obviously, that means exiting above 30%, because we come in somewhere in the 28%-ish range. And so, I think you have it right, it is an exit rate, that’s going to be somewhere in the low 30%s, we will update to what degree that is in January. I think when you talk about the macro -- the macro, while there certainly a dynamic environment, it’s probably given all that’s going on in the world held in a bit stronger than we would expect and a lot of what’s going on in our business is kind of the resetting of inventories and channel this year, the resetting of the Outdoor business post-COVID and a little bit of the shift that consumers have from buying goods to buying services. And so I think the topline next year, we are expecting a similar stablish type macro environment with some dynamic elements around it, but it’s really going to depend on our volume next year, is really going to depend on has the consumer stabilized and the rebalance between goods and services and has the outdoor business stabilized post-COVID.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe: Oh! Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. It seems like everyone is getting in three or four questions into one question. I will try and keep a bit simpler. But maybe no, who knows. I am just thinking, in the sort of a flat macro, given the imagery destocked especially in the Attachments, and obviously, Outdoor. Even unstable macro, do you think you can grow topline in that kind of setup? And then maybe my follow on question within the question is, what does the write-down at the Irwin and Troy-Bilt tell us about those brands. I mean, is this part of the SKU reduction initiative. Any kind of like insights into what’s driving those write-downs?
Don Allan: Yeah. I think, the -- I will start with the brand question and navigate to the macro question related to next year and thoughts about could we grow our topline. The Irwin and Troy-Bilt brands that are very good brands and they are outstanding brands in our portfolio. But as we have continued to focus on the simplification of our company, there’s a lot of aspects of that. There’s the aspects of how we do business with our customers and our suppliers. How we work internally in a more efficient and effective way. But there’s also looking at the simplification of the brands we have and how we go to market, and where we can effectively utilize them the most. We clearly have three very powerful brands that are incredibly important to our strategy in DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN and Stanley, and those would be focal points for that strategy going forward. But as you get into the next tier of brands like Irwin or LENOX or Troy-Bilt, et cetera. We will utilize them effectively but we will utilize them in a more simplified way and then you really seeing the impact of that with the adjustment to the valuation of what was on our balance sheet. It’s really nothing more than that. There’s a little bit of the SKU rationalization impact in there, but I think it’s more of the strategic way we are going to utilize it going forward. Looking at the macro for next year, I mean, Pat gave really good answers to our view is things are not, they are kind of mixed and it’s dynamic. That’s the way it is today and then we are kind of going into next year thinking that’s going to be similar to that. We have pockets of strength like our Professional Tool business. We have weak points in Outdoor and consumer trends. We get strength in aerospace and auto in our fastener and Industrial businesses. And we have some destocking happening in some other portions of our Industrial business and probably will be behind us as we go into next year. So, we think it’s going to be mix like that throughout most of next year. Could things get worse? Possibly. Could things be better? Yes, that’s possible, too. I think we are all watching the Fed to see what it does related to interest rates. If interest rates do not continue to rise, then I think we feel like there will be a stable environment that we can manage through that will be somewhat consistent to this. And if it is stable, can we grow? Well, we are investing for the main objective and reason to is to focus and gaining market share. And we have had a long history of gaining market share at Stanley Black & Decker. And we went through a period of time, in particular, in late 2021 and 2022, where we felt the impact of the shortage of semiconductors that really put us in a position where we actually lost some market share and we have been pretty frank and clear about that. But we are positioning ourselves again to get back to gaining share and we believe we stabilized a lot of that at this stage, and these investments that Chris referred to and Pat in their commentary are things that we believe will allow us to grow above the market, whatever the market is. And if the market is negative, we will -- we won’t be slight as much negative, if it’s stable or neutral will probably grow a little bit. And that’s really the goal and objective that we are going after, and over time, we would like to, as we have said be able to say that we can grow somewhere between 2 times to 3 times the market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you. I’d actually like to start where you just ended on, on market share and trends there. And my question, I guess, specifically, there has been obviously a change in the mix of construction in North America or you have larger projects, major projects, whenever. Maybe housing is holding in there. I am little bit curious if there are any margin or market share or go-to-market impacts from that, maybe have more Pro, maybe have more high need, high reliability, maybe not. I am just curious about whether that has any impact on the business? Thank you.
Don Allan: Thanks, Rob. Yeah. I think, the -- we are probably over using the word dynamic, but I think it’s an appropriate word to describe the current market situation, because there’s a lot of different shifts happening. There is certainly a great deal of construction activity, but it’s shifted quite a bit from what it was 18 months, 24 months ago where it was very heavily residential focused and commercial focus to some extent and then we went through the pandemic and the commercial activity slowed down. So, we continue to see different types of shifts. We do not see radical shifts in our business model though or how we go to market at this stage. One of the really great things about Stanley Black & Decker is that we have over the years been very focused on what are the right channels to the end-user. The professional that ultimately is the ones the individuals that use our tools and because of that history and those channels that we have very strong presence in not only North-America, but the European markets, as well as emerging markets around the globe. We have their presence to be able to ensure that we are meeting the needs of the end-user and if the end-user is shifting to e-commerce, we have the ability to serve them an e-commerce as well or if they continue to want to go to the traditional distributor that they have spent time with, we sell through that channel. So I think we are positioned well for whatever may happen in the future. Clearly, there will be a shift -- continued shift over time, we are more and more people focus on e-commerce activity. We positioned ourselves well over the last decade to be able to continue to address that. I think you will see more of that shifting as you get into some of these commercial and industrial channels with larger distributors as they built some e-commerce platforms during the pandemic to deal with a period of time where people didn’t want to get close to each other and we have been able to address that as well. So we are going to continue to do that. They will probably be an area that we will invest in overtime to make sure that we meet those needs of the channel.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Joe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the sort of returns targets around investment spend. And so when you think about investing $125 million, how do you think about the returns there and tracking them. And so, both from the market outgrowth, as well as the evidence of that. So when you spend $125 million, how do you go about tracking that it’s actually achieving the targeted outcomes?
Don Allan: Yeah. Joe, what I would say is, long-term we want to have very productive investments in SG&A that’s mostly where these investments we are talking to you are centered. And our long-term financial algorithm probably has SG&A somewhere around that 19%-ish of the net sales. And so long-term every time we put a $1 into SG&A, you need to be getting more than five of those out of the topline at a gross margin that are above our fleet average and that’s certainly as we go into these investments, very, very much be intend. The pace at which that happens, obviously, can differ depending on where you are in your certain competitive dynamics of which investments you are making at a given point in time. But that’s our financial algorithm. Right now and maybe, Chris, might want to add some things to this, but our focus right now is on reenergizing the engineering in innovation engine and then reenergizing the activation around our pre-existing marketing investments in around that innovation. Those two together are probably 80% to 90% of the investment per spend that we are making and it’s all to get the growth of the biggest brands getting back to above market growth. I don’t know if there’s anything you want to add to that, Chris?
Chris Nelson: No. I just think that the comment that Don made about the three flagship brands that we have. And it’s not only about net incremental investment, but it’s also taking a look and seeing how we can reallocate existing dollars towards those three priority brands and the key initiatives that we see with the Pro end-user, as well as making sure that we have the right commercial resources in place to be driving those returns as well. So we are thinking at -- looking at the entirety of the spend and not just the net incremental and then driving that into measurable initiatives to be able to make sure that we are getting the types of returns above fleet average that Pat referenced.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Don Allan: Good morning.
Nicole DeBlase: Just wanted to ask one on pricing. So I think originally you guys were kind of expecting flat to slightly down in the quarter for Tools, obviously, a little bit weaker than that. Just maybe a little bit more color on this from a competitive perspective and your thought process on pricing into 4Q and perhaps thoughts around 2024? Thank you.
Don Allan: Go ahead, Pat.
Pat Hallinan: Yeah. Nicole, I mean, purely from a guidance and actuals perspective, I’d say, very much within the bounds. I’d say the only dynamic that played out a bit differently in the quarter is the promotional mix around margin accretive Power Tools was a bit higher, which was net accretive to the P&L, you saw the gross margin performance in the quarter. It just as you reconcile and provide out the actual color and pricing was a little bit more than we would have expect. But I think that’s kind of on the margin of just how promotional activity unfolds in the quarter. But I and Chris may want to add to this. I don’t think we see any kind of change to the competitive dynamics inclusive of the pricing related to the competitive dynamics.
Chris Nelson: No. As I said earlier, I think, we are -- we see fairly good stability in the pricing and not a lot of competitive deep discounting and our -- just to reiterate, our focus is to be healthily involved in the promotional aspect of the business, because we think it’s important to have those key brands and products out in front of our end-users and our customers and we intend to continue at kind of those traditional levels. But more importantly, we are looking through our innovations and how we think about launching new products to be able to continue to supplement and grow those margins as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Don Allan: Good morning.
Joe Ritchie: So, you talked about getting a normalized production in the fourth quarter. I am curious, maybe two-part question, do you expect to stay at normalized production throughout 2024 and then as you kind of think about maybe some of the one-time hit to your profitability in 2023. What -- can you quantify whether it’s the inventory piece, the production piece, how much does that help the bridge for 2024?
Don Allan: Yeah. I will let Pat give it a little more color on that, but we are pleased that we have gotten to a more stable manufacturing level here in the fourth quarter. And at this point the view of next year is, if we assume the environment that Pat described around the $45 of EPS, that-- for in that range, because of where the macro is we would expect it to continue to be stable. We will continue to focus on optimizing inventory next year. So Pat, maybe give it a little more color on that.
Pat Hallinan: Yeah. Yeah. I think, Joe, we certainly feel like we have opportunity to get inventory much leaner, right, probably to the tune of $1 billion to $1.5 billion over the next two years to three years at a pace of $400 million to $500 million a year. I think as it relates to the production normalization, you asked about and as it relates to kind of one-time items in the cost structure. I’d say for the most part 2024, we expect production to be normalized. Obviously, as we and the rest of the Outdoor industry find the new kind of post-COVID Outdoor base, we will be mindful of the production levels in our Outdoor space. But that’s kind of $2 billion-ish of $13 billion, $14 billion T&O business. So I think those production schedules will be in tied to the market realities we see in Outdoor. But broadly speaking, in this fourth quarter and as we head into 2024, Tools production has normalized. I think as you talk about the one-time costs. Those you are kind of seeing in our gross profit as we exit the fourth quarter of this year. So, during this year, you have seen a cost of about 400 basis points in total, 300 basis points of which was roughly high cost inventory and one of which -- 100 basis points of which was kind of under absorption of fixed cost. That has played out within 2023 and you are seeing that in the gross profit margin at almost did 28% in the third quarter and will probably be at or above in the fourth quarter. And so that’s kind of behind us and we are building off of that 28% plus gross margin next year as we head into 2024 and the program continues.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We would like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-01 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2023 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2023 second quarter webcast. On the webcast in addition to myself is Don Allan, President and CEO; Pat Hallinan, EVP and CFO; and joining us for Q&A this morning is Chris Nelson, COO, EVP, and President of Tools and Outdoor. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning, Don and Pat will review our second quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to our cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter performance represented strong execution across the organization, driving significant progress towards our business transformation objectives on multiple fronts. Before I get into the results, I am extremely pleased to welcome Chris Nelson to our leadership team and we have him joining us on the call for Q&A today. Chris started in June as our Chief Operating Officer and President of our Tools and Outdoor business. Chris is an experienced global business leader with strong industry knowledge and a successful track record of implementing growth strategies, which have delivered customer-centric innovation and profitable market share expansion. I'm excited to see Chris assume leadership of the Tools and Outdoor business. He is bringing new energy and perspective, which will further position us for strong execution and faster profitable growth. Welcome, Chris. With this critical appointment, Stanley Black & Decker's senior leadership team is now in place. Together we will bring our shared vision to life, optimizing the company around our core businesses and strong portfolio of global brands, as we execute our strategy to generate sustainable growth and margin expansion. As you'll hear from Pat in a few moments, our cost and supply chain optimization program is ahead of plan to the first six months of 2023 and building momentum. The compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets we serve combined with the progress we've made transforming our business, including our improved cost position, gives us the confidence to pursue further growth investments in the second half of this year. Deploying these growth investments as part of our $300 million to $500 million target over the next three years is intended to accelerate market share gains. As we drive these investment priorities, we are also maintaining our commitment to return value to our shareholders. And to that end, our Board of Directors approved a modest increase to our quarterly cash dividend amounting to $0.81 per share. Shifting now to our second quarter performance. We demonstrated that we are continuing to advance our transformation journey and ahead of the planned program. Specifically, we reduced inventory by nearly $400 million in Q2, which brings our aggregate program to date reduction to $1.4 billion since mid-2022. Our Global Cost Reduction Program delivered $230 million of pre-tax run-rate savings in the quarter, on track for the expected $1 billion in annualized savings by the end of this year. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 23.6%, a sequential improvement of 50 basis points, our second consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And all of these actions translated into $200 million of free cash flow in Q2. Second quarter revenue was $4.2 billion which was down versus the prior year due to lower consumer Outdoor and DIY volume, as rising interest rates have tempered consumer spending in addition to the negative year-over-year impact of the oil and gas divestiture completed last year. That said, demand remains solid for the professional side of the market, which represents roughly 70% of our Tools business. As it relates to the end markets, the US retail point-of-sale for our Tools and Outdoor products remained in a growth position this quarter versus 2019 levels, bolstered by price and healthy pro demand. Both Tools and Outdoor POS through the first four weeks of July is growing versus prior year, a potentially positive signal for the back half of 2023. We're also encouraged by a stabilizing residential construction market, despite the rising interest-rate cycle. US homes starts are running at a pace of 1.4 million units in June, a strong signal that demand for housing remains sound. This is complemented by US permits to build single-family homes rising to a one-year high and positive trend in housing completions. Additionally, contractor backlog in the US remains healthy for repair and remodel activity. The European markets are experiencing similar trends with softer DIY markets balanced with a healthier level of construction activity and professionals with backlogs through the end of this year. And then finally, our channel partners continued to be focused on optimizing inventory levels and we expect that to be a modest headwind throughout 2023. Across our Industrial end markets, we are seeing continued strength in global automotive and aerospace. So while the end markets across Stanley Black & Decker remain relatively stable with pockets of strength, we are monitoring the demand environment and continue to plan for a range of outcomes and we will respond accordingly if we see current trends shift. Operationally, we continue to be focused on the prioritization of inventory reduction and cash generation, with 2Q adjusted diluted EPS coming in at a loss of $0.11 which was better than our plan. Due to the solid progress we have made on our key financial goals in the first half, we are narrowing our 2023 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $0.70 up to $1.30 and narrowing our free cash flow range to $600 million to $900 million. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. Now let me walk through the details of our business segment performance. Beginning with Tools and Outdoor, total revenue was $3.5 billion down 5% organically versus prior year, that favourable price realization was more than offset by volume decline. We continue to make progress on the Tools and Outdoor adjusted operating margin, which was 4.5% up 150 basis points sequentially driven by benefits from volume leverage and cost control versus prior year our operating margin rate was down as price realization was more than offset by selling through high-cost inventory, planned production curtailment costs and lower volume. I would now like to provide some more detail on our various Tools and Outdoor geographies. North America was down mid-single-digits organically weighted by lower consumer Outdoor and DIY tool demand as well as modest customer destocking. Organic revenues were stronger sequentially as we lap tougher comparables and saw benefits from better order fill rates with our customers while leveraging strength and professional demand. Our European revenue was down 1% organically with bright spots in the UK and Southern regions as they both posted high-single-digit organic growth. The emerging markets' performance was down 3% organically. However, when you exclude the impacts from our Russian business exit, the remaining countries had high-single-digit organic growth. This was led by strong demand in Brazil, particularly within the professional channels. Moving to our strategic business unit performance, we experienced an Outdoor organic revenue decline of 12%. As widely reported by many in this industry, the challenging start to the outdoor season persisted for the entire season. And we did experience notable softness in POS and replenishment in the quarter especially surrounding higher price point retail products. The hand tools business was flat organically versus prior year and overcame softer DIY volume with international growth and certain categories strength. Notably, DEWALT storage solution growth including the expanded softline and TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 portfolio offerings introduced earlier this year. Power tools declined 4% organically as softer consumer market demand persisted and customers remain cautious with inventory levels. This result was notably better than the first quarter as we saw continued Pro momentum, coupled with positive impacts from a healthier supply chain, leading to better service levels and increased promotional opportunities, particularly with DEWALT and CRAFTSMAN. Now shifting to our industrial business, which had 3% organic growth in the quarter. The total segment revenue declined 5% versus 2Q 2022 as price realization was more than offset by last year's oil and gas divestiture and currency. We improved the adjusted operating margin by 370 basis points versus prior year, including continued price realization and cost actions to deliver adjusted operating margin of 13%. This represents strong execution and a great financial outcome this quarter for our industrial team. Within this segment Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 8%, including aerospace growth of 31% and auto growth of 15% as we captured cyclical rebounds in these markets along with share gains. This favourable performance was partially offset by industrial fastening and attachment tools' organic revenue declines, primarily as a result of customers destocking to optimize their inventory levels. While long-term fundamentals for growth remain solid, we believe temporary channel inventory reductions will continue to impact these industrial businesses in the second half of the year as well. In summary, the team continues to navigate market conditions with several pockets of strength in a few areas of pressure while we continue to improve our margins. I want to thank the entire Stanley Black & Decker organization for your focus on our key priorities. The progress to date is very encouraging and energizing as we take the next several steps of our business transformational journey. Turning to the next slide. I would like to underscore the importance of the strategy that we launched a year ago to transform Stanley Black & Decker to accelerate market share gains and drive consistent organic growth. Our teams around the world are gaining traction and executing on our primary areas of focus. One, streamlining and simplifying the organization as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our end-users and various channel customers. Two, accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return adjusted gross margins to historical 35% plus levels, while improving fill rate to better match inventory with customer demand. Three, prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization. And four, continuing to advance innovation, electrification, and global market penetration to achieve organic growth of two times to three times the market. Our business transformation is our path to continuing to enhance our customer and end-user experiences while delivering on our financial commitments and enabling the pursuit of strategic growth investments behind our iconic brands, innovation engine, electrification and commercial activation. Key investments in innovation, coupled with market activation are being accelerated to maximize the impact of our product launches with our global customers and end-users. For example, our fully integrated CRAFTSMAN campaign was built to drive traffic to our key retail partners, instant repeat purchases, and engage new users. To-date, we've shown strong initial results breaking through the industry clutter. Since the campaign launched in the second quarter, we've driven both online and offline traffic to retail and demonstrated improved tools point-of-sale run-rate versus the prior year to support brand market share growth. We're excited to see continued positive momentum from this exciting CRAFTSMAN brand campaign. We are also leveraging the strength of our DEWALT brand with a Pro-inspired product roadmap to expand core innovation as we released enhanced product offerings to improve the End-User experience. We recently launched two new DEWALT Sealed Head Ratchets. The 20-volt MAX XR as well as the extreme 12-volt MAX options, delivering power, versatility, and durability engineered with the professional in mind, particularly, automotive, electrical, and mechanical tradespeople. The innovative design meets the needs of Pros across industries on any job site. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR Brushless Cordless Rivet Tools were also introduced this quarter. Design for precision fastening and pre-fabrication, assembly, HVAC, roofing, and automotive applications. These tools have features such as on-board nose piece storage and a mandrel collector to catch rivets after each shot. Lastly, we introduced a new DEWALT 25-foot LED tape measure, a great example of core innovation within our Tough Series product line. Our engineering team continues to advance our innovation roadmap with best-in-class products and solutions for our end-users as we electrify and enhance safety on the job site as well as push the balance of power and performance across our categories. Let me now turn the call over to Pat to share the latest progress updates and our transformation, financial insights on the quarter and our latest outlook.
Patrick Hallinan: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Don mentioned, we made meaningful progress on our transformation in the quarter and first half of the year. Our cost reduction program is on track to deliver $1 billion of pre-tax run-rate savings in 2023 and is modestly ahead of plan year-to-date. Our simplification and prioritization efforts coupled with our supply chain transformation delivered $230 million of run-rate savings in the second quarter totaling $460 million year-to-date and $660 million since program inception. Approximately half of our 2023 savings were manufacturing costs related and as such we'll begin to see these benefits turn through inventory, off the balance sheet, and on to the P&L starting in the second half and continuing to build in 2024. Our organization is bringing our vision for the supply chain of the future to life with persistent sustainable progress. Strategic sourcing is a major contributor of 2023 savings and is ahead of plan. We have the capabilities in place to ensure changes are executed successfully and we are currently activating additional RFPs to secure further savings. The momentum behind the SBD operating model along with lean manufacturing practices is yielding sustainable productivity efficiencies such as alleviating manufacturing bottlenecks as well as reducing process waste and production downtime. This will become an important source of savings in the coming months and quarters. Our manufacturing and logistics network optimization remains on track, as we work to improve the efficiency and utilization of the asset base. Finally, as it relates to our complexity reduction, the SKU rationalization initiative is progressing in an orderly fashion. At this stage, we have approved the reduction of approximately 70,000 SKUs. We are working with our customers to assist with their transition to replacing products over the coming quarters. We have now decommissioned over 20,000 SKUs. We believe that as we exit the remaining 50,000 offerings, we will have suitable substitutes that will mitigate effectively all of the potential revenue risks which we size at less than 50 million annually. We believe managing this in a methodical way creates value via complexity reduction, without undue disruption to our customers or loss of share. We are pleased with the progress of our global cost reduction program and are confident in our ability to capture $1 billion of run-rate savings by the end of 2023 and $2 billion of run-rate savings by the end of 2025. Turning to our inventory reduction progress and gross margin trajectory. In the second quarter, we reduced inventory by $375 million bringing our year-to-date progress to $575 million. Over the last 12 months, we've achieved approximately $1.4 billion in inventory reduction through the improved supply chain conditions and planned production curtailments instituted during the back half of 2022. To contextualize our first-half performance, the $575 million reduction compares favourably to the average pre-pandemic first-half inventory build of approximately $400 million. We are expecting our full-year 2023 inventory reduction to be between $700 million and $900 million, which represents the DSI, that is about a 155 days. We remain committed to ongoing inventory productivity improvement to generate cash flow that will be used to strengthen our balance sheet while supporting our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends. Turning to gross margin. The pace of improvement has been modestly ahead of expectations as transformation execution and freight deflation are favourable to plan. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 23.6%, up 50 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2023, the impact from liquidating high-cost inventory and the production curtailments represented approximately 400 basis points to 500 basis points of margin headwinds in the second quarter. Moving forward, we expect continued sequential improvement in adjusted gross margin driven by a lower impact from turning high-cost inventory and an increased benefit as our cost transformation improves the P&L. Assuming the demand levels and other assumptions that underpin our guidance, we expect adjusted gross margin to be 27% to 29% in the second half, a strong improvement versus recent quarters. While this is a significant step up from the front-half performance, we have line-of-sight into the cost-savings already generated and on the balance sheet that corresponds to lower-cost of sales and margin improvement in the coming quarters. To conclude, we're starting to reap the benefits from the inventory reductions and supply chain transformation and we'll remain focused on delivering our targeted adjusted gross margin of 35% plus by 2025. Now turning to 2023 guidance. Our expected GAAP earnings per share range has been narrowed to negative $1.25 to negative $0.50 from negative $1.65 to positive $0.60, inclusive of one-time charges, primarily from the global supply chain transformation and outdoor integration. The current pre-tax charges estimate was narrowed to $300 million to $325 million with approximately 25% of these expenses being non-cash. The 2023 quarterly profile of GAAP taxes and GAAP earnings per share is significantly impacted by the pre-tax loss in the first half and the interim tax impact of certain benefits factored into our annual effective tax rate assumption. However, as we expect to generate pre-tax income in the second half. This interim tax benefit will reverse and we expect our full-year tax rate to be relatively consistent with prior guidance. In parallel, we are also narrowing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $0.70 to $1.30 from our previous guidance range of zero to $2. We are keeping the $1 midpoint consistent with the prior guidance framework versus our previous expectation, we have assumed modestly lower organic growth offset by better gross margin. At the midpoint, this results in an improved full-year adjusted operating profit and margin. This stronger operating performance is offset by an approximate $0.25 impact from higher interest and other expenses below the line, of which, 40% to 50% is interest-rate driven. We are narrowing our full-year free cash flow range to $600 million to $900 million from $500 million to $1 billion. We expect second half cash flow to be supported by positive net income, a further reduction in inventory, and the normal Tools and Outdoor seasonal benefit from working capital. We are planning for total company organic growth to be down mid-single-digits for the year. In terms of the business segment outlook, Tools and Outdoor total organic revenue is expected to be down mid-to-high single-digits for the year, incorporating the softer outlook in Outdoor as well as expectations for continued DIY softness and channel inventory conservatism. We are expecting to regain Cordless Power Tool promotions in the second half, reflecting our improved supply position. And as such, pricing is assumed to be relatively flat to slightly negative consistent with these activities. We continue to see the Pro tool user holding strong. And at this point, we believe the range of outcomes for volume covers some variability for the US consumer and DIY demand balance with the potential for stronger professional demand in the back half. In Industrial, we expect flat to low-single-digit organic growth on a full-year basis supported by a cyclical rebound in aerospace and auto. This is modestly lower than our prior outlook as we incorporate an assumption for continued customer destocking in attachment tools and industrial fastening. Production normalization and the pace of growth investments will both be flexed based on demand. We are planning for production to normalize in the fourth quarter recognizing the lower volume. We remain disciplined and flexible in our approach to reinvesting to drive organic growth. Our focus is to deliver on our financial expectations while utilizing gross margin improvements to fund growth investments. Our outlook assumes approximately $125 million of annualized investment with a goal to ultimately deploy $300 million to $500 million over the next three years. Clearly, our willingness to invest increases as we progress along our gross margin expansion trajectory. We expect second half adjusted operating margins to be in the mid-to-high single-digit as our cost efficiencies offset volume pressures. Turning to the important remaining elements of guidance. The expectation for the third quarter would be a sequential improvement in operating profit, primarily from the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives and a lesser impact from destocking. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter is planned to be approximately 80% of the full-year adjusted EPS amounts. And due to losses within the first half, the back-half adjusted EPS will be more than a 100% of the full-year total adjusted EPS. So in summary, we are exiting the first half with strong momentum across our cost-savings and cash generation initiatives with some of the more significant impacts from our inventory reduction now in the rear-view mirror, we are focusing on driving the items within our control to deliver further margin improvement and to fund investments. We continue to manage the business with the long-term in mind and we believe we have the right strategy in place to successfully navigate our path forward as we remain focused on driving above-market organic growth with margin expansion and enhance shareholder returns. With that, I will now pass the call back over to Don.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Pat. We are pleased to report another quarter of meaningful progress related to our transformation journey. Successful execution against our plan gives us the confidence to increase our focus on reinvestment toward faster growth as we fuel our team with more resources to unleash the power of our amazing brands, strengthen the innovation machine, and stimulate demand with enhanced end user activation. We believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization as well as reinvest in our core businesses will enable us to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability. I am proud to be alongside the best people, the best brands, and the most powerful innovation engine in our industry. As we continue to focus on what we can control to be successful, I am confident that we are recreating a significant market share gaining machine. With that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis.
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open.
Timothy Wojs: Hey guys. Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Timothy Wojs: At risk of being yelled at, I'm going to try to ask a two-parter. So I guess the first question, just as you're looking at gross margins kind of first half to second half, if, Pat, maybe you could give us some color on the bridge in terms of how you go from kind of low 23s in the first half to that 27% to 29% in the back half, how much of that is production versus some of the cost savings that you're seeing there? And then I guess second, since we've got, Chris, on the call, maybe just hoping to get a little bit of his kind of early thoughts and observations as you've gotten into the business.
Patrick Hallinan: You know, I'll start, Tim, with gross margin. It's a meaningful step up, but it's an important part of our journey. And we're confident in delivering it for the back half of this year. A big chunk of it is the roll-off of high-cost inventory. I'd say, you know, the bridge from roughly at 23%, 24% up to 28%-ish number is about 100 points of production curtailment fading away slightly and the balance is a mix of both cost savings generated by our transformation and dissipation of the high-cost inventory over the past, probably, equal parts of each in that regard.
Chris Nelson: This is Chris. Tim, thanks for the question. And I just wanted to start by saying how honored I am to join Don and the entire Stanley Black & Decker leadership team to help bring the company's long-term strategic vision of accelerated organic growth to life. As you well know, Don and the team have made meaning -- meaningful progress on this ambitious plan and I'm just grateful for the opportunity to help drive the company's transformation forward. As I've come on board, as you might expect, it's been a lot of taking time to learn and listen. And I got to say, it's been quite a whirlwind thus far in the first six-ish weeks. Then, seven factories spent at least today with every major business unit going through market trends, the products, the product roadmaps for the future, bend all the key design centers in North America, and had several key customer meetings. And through this process, what I'd say is that, the three real key observations and opportunities stand out. First is the long-term commercial opportunities exist due to the impressive strength of Stanley Black & Decker's brands and products. Simply put, our customers really, really like our products and our brands and want to grow with us. And that's something that cannot be underestimated for the future. Secondly is that the innovation engine within Stanley Black & Decker is amazing and I do believe it is a differentiating capability. Our ability to start with -- work with the end-user to understand their environment as well as the issues that they are trying to solve and then rapidly be able to turn that into design and implementation of products and solutions to help our customers solve their problems and become more efficient is really going to be an important future catalyst for growth. And then third is, as I've been out and spent time in the factories and in the operations, seeing the amount of traction that exists on the operations and supply chain transformation. There are obviously real benefits accruing through the P&L and Pat referenced those earlier, but as importantly, I can see the foundation that is putting -- being put in place that will make this a sustainable and long-term opportunity for the company. And it's also clear that the -- that there's ample future runway and that we're in the early innings of the transformation and that the future savings will be able to be reinvested back in the business to continue to fuel growth as well as margin expansion. So really the combination of these three key observations and opportunities really -- it has been very excited as far as the opportunity for long-term value creation within Stanley Black & Decker.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning and welcome to Chris. Maybe just my question was understood just now that bridge from first half to second half of this year, but just wanted to check on any color you could give on the bridge from this year as a whole into next. And I suppose, if we look at your second half guidance for this year, it's about including some sort of outdoor seasonality assumption. It's maybe 3.50 of annualized EPS based off your second half guide at the midpoint. You had talked about a $5-ish EPS for next year previously, so I just wondered sort of any updated thoughts on that EPS step-up into 2024. And sort of related to that, it looks like your inventories will still be well above historical norms at the end of December, but you talk about production normalization during Q4, so I just wanted to sort of square that away when thinking about next year. Thank you.
Donald Allan: Thank you for the questions. And I'll kick it off and then pass it over to Pat for a little more detail, as far as our perspective on next year. We have talked about in previous calls a $5 -- or a $4 to $5 range for 2024 for EPS. Given what we're seeing in the back half and what we're currently projecting for revenues, the improvement in the gross margins, we're making some investments in SG&A that will plant some seeds for future share gain activity. We do think we're positioning ourselves to be in that $4 to $5 for next year, depending on a couple of factors. Does the revenue maintain itself or grow? Or do we see continued pressure due to economic reasons? And how much more investment do we want to do to really drive that share gain opportunity across the globe? Those are questions that we'll figure out in the back half of the year. And when we provide guidance in early '24, we'll give more insight, but we think we've built a foundation that allows us to achieve that range I mentioned. I'll pass the inventory portion of the question over to Pat and let him give you a little more sense of where we think we are in the journey of inventory and where we go from here.
Patrick Hallinan: Yes, Julian, I'll pick up where Don left off. I think, from an operating performance and productivity range, we're targeting towards that EPS level, but as Don said, as we get to next year's guidance, we'll look at the macro and we'll look at our investment level for long-term growth. And I think that will decide our EPS for next year. In terms of gross margin this year and into next year, following on that opening question, we can really already see on our balance sheet and already in our savings rhythm the gross margin levels that we're projecting for the back half of this year. So those rates of gross margin delivery are, for the most part, on our balance sheet already for this year. And then your question around how do we step that into next year. Think of every one of the next few years going through the end of 2025 as $500 incremental million of COGS savings off of our revenue base. You're talking 200 to 300 basis points a calendar year of gross margin improvement. And so we continue to track on our long-term cost transformation. And so if we finish this year at 28-ish percent gross margin in the back half of the year, you could kind of expect that 200-plus basis point level of gross margin improvement to be carried into next year. And that's the kind of momentum you should be expecting the next couple of years. In terms of inventory, we're going to make significant inventory progress this year, but you're correct to point out that, by the time we get to the end of this year, our absolute inventory dollars at the end of this year will be in the $5 billion-ish range, which is around 155 days-ish range, which is higher than our long-term history of inventory levels, which have obviously changed since we acquired an outdoors business from the legacy Stanley Black & Decker levels, but still below 155. We'll continue to make progress and we will talk about that more specifically when we give guidance for next year, but we will continue to make progress and be working towards a level that is below 150 across a multi or rather below 140 across a multiyear time horizon. Next year, our progress will be balanced against some of our network changes. We are bringing online some new DCs next year and a new DC footprint altogether, so while we'll make some progress next year, it will be balanced against some of the long-term decisions we're making to improve service and costs in our DC footprint.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Nigel Coe: I'll try and make this question a bit punchier. Thanks, guys. And Chris, welcome. Good to hear you. So the EPS, $0.80 for, well, $0.80 roughly for 3Q midpoint. And so I think that implies 4Q down slightly, so just wondering how we should think about that gross margin cadence between 3Q and 4Q. I'd have thought that maybe some of the cost benefits would benefit 4Q more than 3Q. So just maybe just run through that. And then the comment about pricing flat to slightly negative, is that for the whole corporation, or is that just specifically for Tools & outdoor segment?
Patrick Hallinan: Yes, Nigel, I'd say all you're seeing in 3Q EPS to 4Q is really just a normal seasonal cadence, right? We tend to ship in, in the third quarter a lot of the product that is sold through the holiday season, so it's just a normal cadence that you would see from one quarter to the next. From a gross margin perspective, they'll roughly be even across quarters, if not the fourth quarter being slightly higher, so the margin journey will be on the right momentum track. And all you're seeing in EPS dollars is seasonality. I think, in terms of pricing, 85% of our business is Tools & Outdoor. And all you're seeing in pricing is the fact that this year we're back to a normal seasonal promotional cadence, especially around the Black Friday time frame, without new kind of gross price increases offsetting that introduction of -- reintroduction, I should say, of a normal promotional cadence. So it's just the dynamic of us re-entering a normal promotional cadence that will potentially take us below flat pricing, but it should be a real small marginal amount. That's all you're seeing with both of those dynamics.
Donald Allan: And just a reminder recognizing that, as we launch new products at new price points throughout the year, the impact of the higher price versus the previous product that it's replacing does not flow through that price line, but it does flow through your margins. So you don't necessarily see the full impact of pricing decisions and processes that we have across the company because of that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut: All right. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and welcome, Chris. Wanted to dial in a little bit more into the change in your organic growth outlook for Tools & Outdoor. I think you kind of said it was driven by several different factors, softer outlook in outdoor, DIY weakness, channel inventory conservatism. I was hoping if you could kind of bucket those drivers in terms of what's driving the difference, if you can kind of tie it to the difference, I guess, which is maybe 3% or 4% of a change. And also if the POS turning positive, that was kind of part of your prior guidance because you said it could be a potentially positive signal for the back half. If that continues, would that drive any upside to the guidance?
Patrick Hallinan: Mike, we obviously had to think of a few moving parts as we outlined the back half of the year. And so I think where I'd start is our primary objective this year is to deliver margin improvement, working capital reduction in cash, obviously. And we want to keep competing in the marketplace. And the second quarter had many dynamics going on. I would say, in the second quarter, we saw consistently weak outdoor, especially for high-price-point items. And we saw the DIY consumer be under a bit more pressure and on the margin both in tools and outdoors and in subsegments of our Industrial business, channel conservancy -- conservatism on inventory. So all of those things were dynamics that played out. We anticipated them in the second quarter. And that's why, when we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter, we softened up our revenue expectations on the second quarter; and they played out about as we expected in the quarter. And we thought it best, given the fact that those dynamics have kind of stabilized and stayed with us, for the most part, to play those out in the back half of the year. And that's the adjustment you saw, so almost all the adjustment in the back half of the year was to anticipate a similar level of consumer price sensitivity with winter outdoor goods, a continued DIY consumer softness predominantly in North America and then channel destocking in our infrastructure business. And I'd say they've all been kind of equal drivers of us taking a couple hundred million dollars out of our back half sales forecast, but I'd say the good news is we feel like right now, absent a new macro change, our demand environment has stabilized. And that demand environment has stabilized around a strong pro and really strong aero and automotive in our Industrial business. Then I don't think there's any kind of new dynamic with the DIY consumer. Our intent is up for when student loan repayments start around October, but absent that bringing a new macro dynamic into the picture, we feel like our demand outlook has stabilized and we're feeling good about our back half. And then Don referenced there have been some bright spots, things like power tool POS at the very end of the quarter. And we'll see. Those things may emerge, I think, throughout this year given the fed actions. I'd say the broader demand environment has actually surprised us in the sense that it hasn't been more challenging. And so hopefully, those positive trends continue, and if they do, they present upside.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open.
Christopher Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the earlier commentary on the bridge into 2024. I understand, if you annualize the back half, you're at $3 EPS, but the back half is a seasonally low point. It feels like, if we adjust for seasonality, we're already closer to $4 of annualized EPS. And you guys also said, next year, it sounds like gross margin up maybe in the low 30s versus the high 20s. That's obviously a very significant EPS tailwind and it feels like that would more than offset the incremental step-up in growth investments, so can you just maybe provide some more color on that? Thank you.
Donald Allan: Well, I think what I articulated and Pat added some detail to it and more robust detail to it is a pretty good summary of where we think we are at this point. And you could build a bullish case that the numbers should be higher for next year, but you do have to factor in the fact that we really want to make sure that we continue to invest in certain key things in our company. We have to get more resources out on the field, closer to our end users. We need to have more engineering resources in key pockets to drive additional innovation opportunities. We've talked about electrification. We want to continue to do that in certain categories that are changing very rapidly. We have to continue to invest in that space. There's more investing we need to do on the digital marketing front, around social media and the activities that we do with our products, to really make our end users as fully aware as to the great innovation machine that we have and what we're putting in the marketplace. Those are things that we have to continue to invest in and so we want to strike the right balance in 2024 of earnings in the sense and cash flow of what's the opportunity for growth as we look at the markets and evaluate that later this year going into 2024. We have a good sense of what's going to happen with gross margins, as Pat articulated. And then the other wildcard is really how much do we want to invest to really plant more seeds for share gain opportunities in the future. That's an important part of our business model that's going to ensure that we're successful for the next several decades, and we want to make sure we do it in the right way and the right level of balance. And that's why we think, as you think about next year, that range of $4 to $5 probably makes sense. If we change our perspective because of market conditions or how much we want to invest, we'll provide that as soon as possible, but I think it's the right way to think about next year at this stage.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Donald Allan: Good morning
Nicole DeBlase: Maybe just a couple of follow-ups from prior questions that were asked. So on pricing, can you just characterize the competitive environment that you're seeing? Anything concerning out there? And then with respect to the channel inventory dynamics in the tools business, I think you guys talked about some channel adjustments this quarter. Is the expectation that, that kind of continues into the back half? Where are your inventories versus where you would like them to be in the channel? That would be great. Thank you.
Donald Allan: Sure. So I'll take the pricing question and I'll pass the channel inventory question over to Pat. I think where we are is, we're seeing a lot of different things occurring around deflation in the freight space. So I think, when we look at freight, we've all seen freight costs have gone down dramatically. We're experiencing that. We're seeing that benefit in our P&L and we'll continue to try to leverage that opportunity as much as possible. On the metals side and commodity space, we're seeing a little bit of indication that things are starting to pull back, as far as commodity prices. And so we're chasing that opportunity, but overall the commodity basket for us is not moving down dramatically at this stage. Now we are pursuing these opportunities to ensure that we actually get the benefit when they do emerge later this year or into next year, depending on how that plays out, but also we have to recognize that we probably won't see much of that benefit here in 2023 just given the level of inventory we have on our books. And that will get hung up in the inventory and will read through eventually in 2024, so the question then becomes what does that mean to pricing. And so what adjustments do we need to make? What's happening in the market? And at this point, we feel like our pricing is where it needs to be versus market conditions and the competitors. We tend to want to be, especially with brands like DEWALT, at a premium versus many of our competitors. And we feel like right now the pricing position is in a healthy place, and so we don't see any need for any adjustments associated with that. If deflation becomes a bigger number as we go into 2024, we will continue to look at that and evaluate that. However, we do have to remember that, as we went through this historical inflationary cycle, we did not get 100% price recovery on that. It took many quarters for the pricing actions to get into our customers and so we experienced a lot of margin pain in that transition period. And so there has to be a tail at the back end associated with this deflationary cycle, whatever it is. And we're going to work with our customers in a balanced way to do the right thing for ourselves, our company and for them. And we'll continue to take that approach, as we've done in the past, and we think it's the right approach for this particular cycle. Pat, do you want to talk about where we are with channel inventory and where we're going?
Patrick Hallinan: Yes. Nicole, channel inventories. We look at our current level of channel inventories relative to history. We're very much at or right around normal levels of channel inventory. And so I think, if there wasn't macro uncertainty or if short-term rates weren't as high as they are, we would be biased to stay where we are or to the upside, but I think, because of the rate picture in particular, with our channel partners paying much more in short-term rates to support their inventory and the fact there is macro uncertainty, their bias is to keep things low and, if not, to try to find new lows. We don't think there's big moves out there ahead of us. It's something very modest. And I would say our back half guidance anticipates somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million to $100 million of inventory reduction in our guidance, as we've talked here today, and we think that's a pretty good number for the back half of the year. I mean obviously it could range outside of that if the macro environment changes, but that's what we've considered for the back half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.
Adam Baumgarten: Hey, good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Adam Baumgarten: Can you just talk about how demand trended throughout the quarter into July? It seems like it built throughout the quarter. And the July commentary is pretty encouraging. Just maybe some additional color there would be helpful.
Donald Allan: Well, I think the markets are -- do have some volatility to them. However, when you step back and look at the trends that have been emerging in the first six months of 2023, we all know it was a very challenging outdoor season. And everyone in the industry experienced it. We experienced it to. And the higher-priced ticket items, as I mentioned in my presentation, continue to be a pressure point. There's no doubt that the outdoor business went through a bubble during the pandemic. And there was a lot of purchasing activity because people were at home, and we're starting to see the back-end effect of that here in -- we experienced some of it last year and we're experiencing more here again in '23, and then we'll see what '24 brings in the future. The trends in POS continue to be positive, and I said that in my comments. July has been a good start to the quarter. At this point, it's not something that is an indication that we already feel like we're going to outperform expectations. As Pat said, it's a potential upside for us to evaluate and monitor as we go throughout the summer. And we'll see where things are trending, but the consumer continues to shift a lot of money away from home improvement and we just have to make sure that we continue to monitor that and see what happens. So I look at it as an opportunity and a positive that, hopefully, evolves as the back half plays out, but I don't want to get too excited about three or four weeks of activity at this stage.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me, if you have further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 12:45:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2023 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2023 First Quarter Webcast. On the webcast in addition to myself, Don Allan, President and CEO; and Pat Hallinan, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don and Pat will review our 2023 first quarter year results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and, as such, involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34-F filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.
Don Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I am extremely pleased to have Patrick Hallinan on Board and joining our call today as Stanley Black & Decker’s newly appointed Chief Financial Officer. Pat brings to the team a deep track record of delivering business performance, growth and value creation and complex competitive consumer branded businesses. Following my remarks, Pat will take you through the financial highlights as well as our current outlook. Welcome, Pat. Earlier this week, we also announced that Chris Nelson will be joining the company in mid-June as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President and President of Tools and Outdoor. Chris is an experienced global leader with exceptional industry knowledge and existing relationships with many of our customers. His track record of success implementing growth strategies, which have delivered customer-centric innovation and profitable market share expansion make him the ideal leader for our tools and outdoor business. I look forward to partnering with Pat, Chris and the entire leadership team to streamline and optimize the company around our core businesses and strong portfolio of global brands as we execute our strategy and generate sustainable growth. In terms of our Q1 performance, we continue to build momentum and make strong progress as the organization remains focused on our business transformation plan. We took additional steps forward in the quarter to better serve our customers and deliver for key stakeholders by reducing inventory, leveraging enhanced cost controls and optimizing our global supply chain while continuing to increase our investments in innovation and end-user activation. The global cost reduction program delivered $230 million in pre-tax run rate savings this quarter which is modestly ahead of plan. Since we launched the program we've captured a total of $430 million of annualized savings. This is a great start and we believe we are on track to achieve the expected $1 billion of total program run rate savings by year-end. Inventory reduction is also ahead of plan, with incremental $200 million improvement in the quarter. Even while we strategically build inventory in some categories to prepare for the upcoming outdoor and Father's Day merchandising season, we have now reduced approximately $1 billion of inventory since mid-2022. I am encouraged by our progress thus far and I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company for a strong long-term growth, cash flow generation, profitability and shareholder return. Our first quarter revenue of $3.9 billion was in line with Q4 2022. This was down versus prior year as price realization and solid industrial and professional construction demand was more than offset by lower consumer and DIY volume, currency and the oil and gas business divestiture. Let me now provide some perspective on end market demand. The U.S. retail point of sale for our tools and outdoor products remained in a growth position this quarter versus 2019 levels, bolstered by price and healthy pro demand. The outdoor season had a slow start in March, but April weekly point of sale trends have been encouraging. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 23.1%, up 360 basis points sequentially versus Q4 2022. While there still is more work to be done, we are seeing adjusted gross margin improve as destocking impacts moderate. Adjusted EPS for the period was a loss of $0.41, significantly impacted by our plan prioritization efforts around inventory reduction. We are committed to advancing our business transformation plan and continuing our journey forward with persistent focus on what is within our control. We are monitoring the demand environment and global economic dynamics and planning for a range of outcomes, which balance the potential continuation of the current trends with the possibility of improvement as well as the prospect of a further demand slowdown. We have planned for all three of these scenarios and will respond accordingly if we see current trends shift. We are reiterating our 2023 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $0 to $2 as well as our free cash flow guidance of $500 million to $1 billion. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. As we generate cost savings, we are continuing to make strategic investments in our iconic brands, innovation engine, electrification and commercialization activation to position the business for sustainable growth and margin expansion. This includes hiring additional engineers focused on product platforming, electrification and innovation as well as speed on the street to elevate user activation activities, which will ensure we extend the leadership positions of these iconic brands. Our priorities in 2023 remain unchanged. One, strong focus on cash flow through inventory reduction to assist with ongoing debt deleveraging. Two, sequential improvement in our adjusted gross margin as we drive further supply chain transformation initiatives. Three, get back to gaining market share in all major categories of our Tools & Outdoor business. Successfully executing these priorities will result in a stronger balance sheet and significantly improved EBITDA in the second half of 2023 as we head into 2024. Now let me walk through the details of our business segment performance. Beginning with tools and outdoor. Revenue was $3.3 billion, a decline of 13% as price realization was more than offset by a decline in volume and a negative impact from currency. Volume was impacted by lower consumer and DIY market demand modestly reduced channel inventory and a slow start to the retail outdoor season due to a cold March with temperatures well below the 5-year average. Tools & Outdoor adjusted operating margin was 3%, down versus the prior year as price realization was more than offset by inflation, higher supply chain cost, production curtailment and lower volume. North America and Europe were both down 12% organically as both reasons were impacted by the factors covered for the overall segment. Emerging markets were down 2% organically, but excluding the impacts from our Russian business access the region had 6% organic growth. This was led by strength in Brazil, China and the Middle East. Moving to our strategic business unit performance, power tools and hand tools were primarily impacted by softer consumer demand declining organically 12% and 6%, respectively. The Outdoor business declined 16% organically, largely impacted by softer consumer demand and the cooler weather. The slow start to the season pressured our outdoor results versus planned by approximately 5 to 6 points. We are monitoring demand to determine if this could be potentially recaptured in 2023 with encouraging POS in recent weeks signalling the season is now ramping up. A key growth area for outdoor is leveraging the 2,500 Pro dealers that we acquired with our acquisition. This channel delivered a strong performance in the quarter and was up double digits year-over-year. Pro products under our Cub Cadet and Hustler brands had a solid start and we are building traction with our DEWALT cordless handheld products across the dealer network. Now shifting to our industrial business, which had 3% organic growth in the quarter with double-digit operating margin. Total segment revenue declined 5% versus 2022 as price realization was more than offset by last year’s oil & gas divestiture, currency and volume. The team leveraged price realization and productivity to deliver adjusted operating margin of 11%, up 410 basis points versus the prior year. Within this segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 3%, led by aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 7%, offset by softer industrial market. Attachment tools organic revenues were up 5%, driven by strategic pricing actions and continued conversion of this businesses significant backlog. In summary, this was a job well done across the board of our team we continue to reduce inventory and drove improved gross margin in a mixed revenue environment. My thanks to the entire team as we maintained our focus on the right areas and we are seeing the results of our efforts. On the next slide, I would like to review our long-term strategy that we launched last July as we transformed Stanley Black & Decker to drive consistent organic growth at accelerated levels well above market growth. Our teams around the world are gaining traction and executing on our primary areas of focus. One, streamlining and simplifying the organisation as well as shifting resources to prioritise investment that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our customers and end users. Two, accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return adjusted gross margins to historical 35% plus level while improving fill rate to better match inventory with custom advance. Three, prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization and four, continuing to advance innovation, electrification and global market penetration to achieve organic growth of two to three times the market. Our business transformation remains on track to deliver on these financial commitments as we strive to elevate our customer and end user experiences to world class level. The streamlining of our company and the supply chain initiatives are tracking to expectations and continuing to gain momentum. The four value creation streams within our supply chain transformation strategy are advancing with meaningful strides forward and a $110 million of savings achieved in the first quarter. Our global team is activating against our strategy with speed. The energy and passion is evident and I’d like to extend my sincere thanks to our operations associates across the globe. We have made so much progress in the last nine months and every completed milestone is contributing to our shared vision for the supply chain of the future. Now a few updates in this particular area. Within the few rationalization and product platforming value stream we have approved the reduction of 60,000 SKUs across the portfolio of which 16,000 are now decommissioned. The remaining balance is no longer being manufactured and we are working with our customers to transition to new SKUs in the coming quarters. Strategic sourcing has been a strong contributor to savings as we complete the $2 billion first tranche of spend assessment. We are on track to achieve the targeted savings. Our supply base will include both existing and new vendors with a deliberate intent to improve geographic diversification and consolidation. Our dedicated team is capturing cost savings while deploying new processes to ensure sourcing changes are executed successfully. Our initial announcements related to the manufacturing footprint optimization were made in March, which includes site expansions, transformations into manufacturing centers of excellence, as well as site consolidation. We are on track with our expectations and are taking a holistic approach to our manufacturing base and logistics network to ensure we optimize the efficiency and utilization of our asset base. Finally, we are increasing our focus on manufacturing excellence and re-emphasizing the SBD operating model along with lean manufacturing practices at our factories. We deployed this playbook at four plants in the first quarter and in March we kicked off at nine additional sites. We are seeing strong traction and are capturing improved productivity efficiencies where these tools were activated. We are excited with the progress and you can expect us to continue to make strides in the coming months and quarters. Turning to SG&A, we captured approximately $120 million of savings this quarter and are on pace for $500 million of pre-tax savings by the end of the year from simplifying the corporate structure, streamlining leadership spans of control and organizational layers, and reducing indirect spend. We are confident in our ability to capture $1 billion of run rate savings by the end of 2023 and $2 billion of annualized savings by 2025 from this program. A key tenet of our strategy is the acceleration of investment in innovation and electrification. We are making deliberate strategic investments to maintain our market-leading innovation ecosystem. A couple highlights from this year's outdoor season. In terms of delivering innovative cordless products, the CRAFTSMAN 20-volt line-up is designed for extended runtime and better performance. This includes the new brushless string trimmer that is lighter weight than its gas-powered equivalent and carries more runtime and force than prior generations. The new cordless pressure washer also joins this line-up in addition to the range of other new 20-volt cordless lawn and garden tools. Continuing to expand our 20-volt system is enabling users to go wherever the work is without the limitation of cords or gas engines. These items are currently available for this season and we are excited about the initial market reception. Additionally, we just received notice that we won eight 2023 Popular Mechanics Yard and Garden Best New Product Awards across DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, and Black & Decker. In addition to the CRAFTSMAN offerings just highlighted, the DEWALT pruning saw and String Trimmer were awarded as Best for Contractors and the Black & Decker pruning chainsaw was named best for light duty use. This is a great recognition of the quality of the innovation we bring to the market and our ability to serve our entire user base from the consumer to the most demanding pro. Let me now turn the call over to Pat for some further financial highlights on the quarter and our latest outlets.
Patrick Hallinan: Thank you, Don, and good morning everyone. I'm honored to join Stanley Black & Decker, the worldwide leader in Tools & Outdoor, at such a pivotal moment in the company's history. I have tremendous respect for the leadership team and Stanley Black & Decker's iconic portfolio of professional and consumer brands. During my initial weeks, I have been impressed with the breadth and depth of the company-wide transformation underway. Observing the early traction of the multi-year program and the savings captured during the initial phases, it is clear that the company's transformation is progressing rapidly and powerfully. I am energized to help accelerate the company's journey forward and to enhance our long legacy of market leading innovation and profit performance. Now let me walk through the details of the company's progress towards reducing inventory and improving gross margins. We exited last year with $5.9 billion of inventory. We reduced his by over $200 million in the first quarter. Since mid-2022, we have successfully reduced inventory by approximately $1 billion. This achievement was driven by improved supply chain conditions and planned production curtailments instituted during the back half of 2022 and which continue today. The targeted inventory reduction helped minimize the magnitude of the seasonal working capital build typical of our first quarter. As a frame of reference, our first quarter working capital build has averaged $700 million over the last five years, while this quarter it was $200 million, improving our cash performance primarily via inventory reduction. We are on track to achieve our expected $500 million of first half inventory reduction as we work down raw material and component inventory while selling out finished goods. Our full year 2023 inventory reduction target remains $750 million to $1 billion to drive significant cash flow generation and to pay down debt, strengthen our balance sheet, and back our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends. Overall, the pace of our inventory reduction will be demand dependent and in a few moments I will cover the range of demand scenarios we are considering within our 2023 guidance. Turning to gross margins, which are also improving in a manner consistent with our plan. First quarter adjusted gross margins were approximately 23%, up 360 basis points sequentially versus the fourth quarter 2022, as we saw a smaller headwind from destocking actions and as our transformation initiatives provide a greater income statement benefit, something we expect to continue. Production containments in the first quarter were at levels relatively similar to those of the back half of last year and the destock impacted gross margin by approximately 400 to 500 basis points. We expect a similar impact to the second quarter resulting in second quarter adjusted gross margin consistent with that of the first quarter. Our base case guidance anticipates the adverse margin impact from our targeted production curtailments and destocking will ease through the year. Supporting adjusted gross margin expansion into the mid-to-high 20s for the second half of the year. The timing of normalized production and improved gross margin could shift earlier or later depending on the demand environment and corresponding speed of inventory reduction. We will actively monitor demand and adjust our supply chain to optimize the pace of margin improvement and inventory reduction throughout 2023. An important leading indicator for gross margin is the 110 million of supply chain transformation savings delivered in the first quarter. As these savings turn through inventory later this year, gross margin will expand further. It is encouraging to see the initial progress towards our multi-year target to return adjusted gross margins to the 35 plus percent range. We are prioritizing cash generation, gross margin improvement, and balance sheet strength. By executing against these priorities, we are positioning the company for long-term growth and value creation. Now turning to 2023 guidance. We are reiterating our four-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $0 to $2 per share. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings range per share to be negative $1.65 to $0.60, inclusive of one-time charges primarily from the global supply chain transformation and outdoor integration. The current pre-tax charges estimate was narrowed to 275 to 325 million with approximately 25% of these expenses being non-cash. We continue to target free cash flow generation of $500 million to $1 billion, primarily driven by inventory reduction. Consistent with the framework shared in February, we planned and continue to forecast around three 2023 demand scenarios as the macroeconomic outlook remains dynamic. Our base case scenario assumes a modestly unfavorable market demand environment compared to what we experienced during the second half of last year. In this scenario, we are assuming total organic growth to be down low to mid-single-digit, incorporating the softer start to the outdoor season. Tools & Outdoor, total organic revenue is expected to be down low to mid-single-digit, while we expect low single-digit growth for industrial. The base case also assumes that we maintain the production curtailment with the intention to return to normalized production levels during the third quarter. As a result, the under-absorption of fixed manufacturing costs would continue to constrain second quarter operating margins to low single-digit. As production returns to normalized levels in the back half of the year, we expect operating margin to improve to the mid-to-high single-digit range, resulting in full-year operating margins in the mid-single-digit. Finally, the base case includes approximately 125 million of annualized reinvestment targeting Tools & Outdoor growth acceleration and complexity reduction. We plan to be measured with the magnitude and timing of such investments depending on the demand environment. The second half acceleration scenario contemplates a stronger demand environment, supporting organic growth in the second half of 2023. In this scenario, we would expect a quicker normalization of inventory levels and gross margin improvement. Total organic growth would be relatively flat for the year. This scenario would position the company to deliver high single-digit operating margins in the second half, as well as a larger level of reinvestment to accelerate our transformation. The downside case reflects a deceleration of demand due to elevated recessionary pressures. If this scenario becomes the macro reality, we would expect full-year organic revenues to decline by mid-single-digit, with volume declines in both the Tools & Outdoor and industrial segments. In this scenario, production curtailments would likely remain in place through the end of 2023, extending the timeline of our gross margin recovery. With lower demand, we would adjust the level of reinvestment in CapEx until we have more clarity on the extent and duration of the macro impacts. We believe it is prudent to maintain these ranges of 2023 demand outcomes, production levels, and approaches to reinvestment as we prioritize our transformation and inventory reduction and cash generation. Turning to important remaining elements of guidance, for the full year, we expect the below-the-line expenses in total to be relatively similar to the guidance issued in early February. We are building an expectation for higher interest expense, which is offset by a modestly lower 2023 tax expense assumption. For the second quarter, we are expecting a sequential improvement in operating profit, primarily from seasonally higher levels of revenue. Adjusted gross margin is planned to be in the low 20s, relatively similar to that of the first quarter. Adjusted EPS is planned to be at a loss of approximately $0.40 per share at the midpoint, incorporating an expectation for a higher tax expense versus the first quarter. Free cash flow is expected to be positive in the second quarter, primarily from inventory reduction. Our plan calls for earnings to inflect positively in the second half of the year, generating an annualized EBITDA run rate of approximately $1.3 to $1.7 billion. This range is similar to our view in February, and we believe this is the appropriate base to build off as we deliver our transformation savings over the next couple of years. We are planning for the dynamic operating environment to continue, and feel we have the strategy in place to successfully navigate our path forward as we remain focused on driving above-market, long-term organic growth and margin expansion. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Don.
Don Allan: Thank you, Pat. We are continuing to forge our path forward. We made solid progress again in the first quarter with strong cost savings, inventory reduction, and advancements across all elements of the transformation plan. As we execute against our strategy in 2023, and over the three-year time horizon, we believe our transformation efforts will begin to drive more material financial benefits. Our focus will be to continue to reinvest $300 million to $500 million of these benefits toward faster growth as we strengthen the innovation machine and stimulate demand with enhanced end-user activation. We believe our actions to reshape, focus, and streamline our organization, as well as reinvest in our core businesses, will enable us to deliver strong shareholder value over the long-term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability. We have the best people, the best brands, and the most powerful innovation engine in our industry. Combine this with the passion, energy, and commitment I see across the organization every day, and it gives me great confidence that we will focus on what we can control to be successful, and we ultimately will recreate a significant market share gaining machine. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Don Allan: Good morning.
Nigel Coe: Good morning, and Pat, look forward to meeting you soon, and Don, congratulations on hiring Chris Nelson. He's someone we know really well, so good guy.
Don Allan: Thank you.
Nigel Coe: So my question is really just -- maybe just more detail on the Tools & Storage sales in North America. You talked about footprint of sales being above 2019 levels, but just wondering how that looked year-over-year, maybe the fact the Pro and DIY. And then the pricing of 2%. To what extent was that a lot of promotional activity around maybe outdoor? And how do you see pricing trending through the year? Thanks.
Don Allan: Yes, I'll give a little color on POS, and then ask Pat to give a little color on the pricing part of the question. So I - the POS trends are obviously, when you look at them year-over-year, for some of our customers, they're down in the mid-single digits to high-single digits. Other customers are only down in the low-single digits to flat. So you got a mixed bag of different things happening there, but overall, we are seeing POS down year-over-year in Q1 and that trend will likely continue in Q2 at a lesser magnitude, because as the comp gets easier from Q1 to Q2, that trend will continue. The trend around PRO continues to be very healthy. We're not seeing any major shifts in that dynamic. The consumer side continues to be relatively flat sequentially to what we've been experiencing for the last, two or three quarters since the second quarter of last year. No major shifts there, but certainly not any strengthening on the consumer side as people continue to shift their dollars to different areas across the United States. But overall, I would say POS is kind of trending the way we would expect. Outdoor is a little choppy in the last six to eight weeks, as we saw a pretty rough March due to the weather. Things got better first half to the later stages of April as the weather got better, and then obviously we've seen a little bit of bumpiness in the last week or so as the weather hasn't been great in the Midwest and New England and Northeast in that time frame. And not to be a weather forecaster, but the weather is looking much better as we go into next week, so hopefully that trend shifts back to a positive. But it's a little bit of choppiness. I think, all of us, the retailers, our customers, ourselves, are all looking at probably the next month or so as to what the trends will be in POS, and that will really ultimately define the success of the season. But I do think we've factored our guidance in a way that allows us to navigate that effectively. And, Pat, maybe a little color on price now.
Patrick Hallinan: Pricing environment has been stable. The price increase dynamic for us that you referenced in the first quarter was largely a carry-in price increase. Broadly in the channels and across competitors, the pricing environment remains stable. It appears to us that most in the market are focused on margin enhancement and, therefore, preserving pricing. We don't expect additional price in our outlook through the balance of the year, so stable pricing. We will be, given the supply chain improvements we've been making, we will be engaging in traditional seasonal promotions throughout the year, so that dynamic will be returning, but that's less of a new pricing dynamic and more of a return to traditional seasonal promotions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Thanks very much. Maybe just my question would be around, when you think about that uplift of margins from sort of low single digits amid the high single digits in the second half, maybe try to parse out how much of that is sort of sales uplift versus less destock versus less underproduction? And how we think about the phasing of third quarter versus fourth quarter earnings, anything major to call out there?
Don Allan: Yes. Most of that margin uplift from the first half to the second half is driven by gross profit margin uplift as opposed to some particularly strong volume or SG&A component. And most of it is, as we get into the back half of the year, you'll have more of the progress and the transformation going through the income statement and less of the inventory destock and production curtailment providing headwinds in that. And the order of magnitude is in the 300 to 500 basis points of gross margin improvement first half to back half.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open.
Tim Wojs: Hey. Good morning, everybody, and welcome, Pat. Maybe just on the channels, I guess, what do you – it sounds like you've got kind of varying levels of kind of POS activity between your customers. I mean, how does that kind of translate into channel inventory and kind of what they're holding and kind of what their comfort of current channel inventory is looking like?
Don Allan: Yes. Thanks for asking that question, Tim, because I didn't really get into that when I was talking about POS. But, yes, I would say the inventory levels in the channels and our major customers in North America and Europe are still high when you kind of look at traditional historical levels of inventory, but they are starting to come down. And so we're starting to see improvement in that. And I think for us in particular, the good news has always been that we weren't starting with a high level of inventory compared to maybe other folks within the industry and other competitors. So when you look at Home Depot as an example, we're not far away from where you would traditionally see. We're within a week or so of what we would typically want it to be and what they would want it to be. Lowe's is a little bit higher than that, but Lowe's tends to run at a much higher level of inventory, as we all know, versus Home Depot. So we feel pretty good about it. I think you'll see a continued little bit of working down of our inventory and our customers in Q2 and maybe a little bit of that in the Q3 as we work through the year, depending on where demand goes. So I don't think we're done with the de-stocking, but I think it's something that's very manageable for us versus maybe what some of our competitors are dealing with right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning, guys.
Don Allan: Good morning.
Josh Pokrzywinski: So, Don, I just want to maybe follow up on the SKU reduction. So for what you guys have contemplated and maybe what you've done so far, what has been the drag on organic growth? I guess how much of that drops through to just kind of shelf space loss, et cetera, versus something you can backfill with similar products?
Don Allan: Yes, that's a good question for me to clarify. Thank you for asking that. So we're being very thoughtful on how we do this. And so those 60,000 SKUs is a lot of SKUs. When you hear about that, you start to wonder if that's going to have an impact on revenue. But the ones that we've eliminated in the first phase really had, very little revenue tied to them and very little inventory in the system. So, it was really just eliminating something that hasn't really been selling over the last several years. What you're left with now are the ones that, which is about 45,000 SKUs, that we stopped manufacturing, there's revenue tied to that, and there's inventory in our system tied to it as well. And so, you need to go through a thoughtful process with all of our customers of conversion from those products to other products that exist in Stanley Black & Decker that are very similar in nature. Now, whether that's an upgraded version that has been upgraded through innovation and the customer is still selling the older version, it could be an example of that. It could be an example of a brand being sold under a certain product and that we want to switch that brand over in that particular customer to a similar product but a different brand. And that takes probably 12 to 18 months to navigate through. And so, it's going to be a very slow methodical process with the overall objective being to not have an impact on revenue and to really minimize any potential write-outs that might exist in the world of inventory. And so far, the team has been very successful in doing that, but there's still a lot of work ahead of us. And we have dedicated resources that are focused on this within our tools and outdoor business. And they have a very good grasp of the commercial aspects of this as well as supply chain. And I think they're doing an effective job so far navigating through it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And Pat, welcome and nice to see you again, so to speak. First, well, I guess my only question; I wanted to get a sense of maybe if I can kind of break it into two parts, actually. One is just a clarification on the first quarter results. What drove the upside on the operating margins? I believe you're looking for something more flattish to 4Q. But then secondly, on the guidance, you talked about PRO remaining healthy. I was just curious in terms of how you're thinking about PRO, particularly in the back half. And when you think about tools and storage with the guidance in the base case, if that is looking for a positive inflection or just being more flat, and how PRO figures in that?
Patrick Hallinan: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. In terms of the first quarter favorability, we are executing well on the transformation. And so the transformation is running ahead of plan. And we're feeling good, not just about 2023, but about the road beyond 2023 and delivering on that transformation. So I would say just, when you get to the phasing of it throughout the year, that's more just it's difficult to predict perfectly how inventory rolls off your balance sheet and what level of inventory rolls off your balance sheet. So I would say having guidance that's highly consistent with the original guidance of low 20% gross profit margins in the first half and high 20% gross profit margins in the back half is the way you should think of the business. You should have confidence in the transformation delivering that. And the way it flows quarter to quarter is always going to depend a little bit on mix and what type of inventory is coming off the balance sheet. So I wouldn't subscribe anything other than that to the first half gross profit margin. Solid transformation performance and just an update on where the inventory is falling off the balance sheet. In terms of the outlook of the end market dynamics in Tools & Outdoor for the balance of the year, we would expect what we've seen in the first quarter to persist throughout the balance of the year, which is continued strength in the pro-environment and a softer consumer environment and that dynamic to be relatively consistent across the quarters. But as Don mentioned earlier, Q&A, the comp gets easier as we get from the second quarter to the third quarter. So it's less about a change in end market buyer behavior in the last three quarters of the year, and it's more the comp easing in the latter part of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. So the Q1 inventory reduction certainly seems to be tracking ahead of expectations. But you guys left the 1 HD stock guide unchanged at 500 million. Does this signal that maybe some of the destock was pulled forward into Q1? Or should we think about potential upside on the rate of the first half destock? Because it does sound like outdoor is improving in April relative to March. Thank you.
Patrick Hallinan: Yes, I'd start by reiterating that, we're committed to destocking 750 million to a billion for the year. And that's the commitment. And the team is working through that, given a dynamic macro environment. The reason to not change the flow throughout the first half and the second half is really, channels remain conservative as you would expect with a dynamic macro environment and relatively high short-term borrowing costs. And so, we'll continue to navigate the same environment that they're facing and achieve the year. But right now, it's just too soon to change our outlook on the first half and the second year, second half inventory changes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.
Eric Bosshard: Thanks. Good morning. Patrick, I hear the guidance on the 750 to a billion. I'm curious as you think about solving that in an environment where retail inventories are a little bit heavy. The demand is where it is. I'm curious as you think about promotions and really working through your inventory into an environment where things are slow and the inventories are a bit heavy. Is there a desire to be patient in the pace at which you work through that inventory? Or is there an opportunity to be more aggressive through promotions to clear out that inventory through 2023 to be better positioned for 2024? How do you navigate or solve through that dynamic?
Patrick Hallinan: Now, thanks for the question, Eric. Our inclination is to be more thoughtful around sales and operations planning. It is not our intent, except for around the SKU rationalization areas, it's not our intent to drive an inventory change through aggressive pricing. That is not our intent. We're going to be disciplined on pricing and we're going to be focused on improving margins throughout 2023 and beyond 2023. So we'll be addressing that, Eric, really by internal planning around production relative to sales and we'll update, the guidance as appropriate as the macro unfolds and as channel behavior unfolds.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Thanks, Shannon. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-02 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2022 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Webcast. On the webcast in addition to myself, Don Allan, President and CEO; and Corbin Walburger, Vice President and Interim CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don and Corbin will review our 2022 fourth quarter and full year results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and, as such, involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34-F filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.
Don Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter performance marked another meaningful step forward on our journey to streamline and optimize Stanley Black & Decker. Building on our number one worldwide market position in Tools & Outdoor, as well as our leading Industrial business, we continue to focus on advancing our simplification and transformation strategy. Across the second half of 2022, we improved customer fill rates significantly, reduced inventories by $800 million and realized $200 million in efficiency benefits from our leaner organizational structure as well as enhanced cost control in the back office and the supply chain. These actions generated more than $500 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, which supported a corresponding similar amount of reduction in our debt, a key objective of our capital allocation plan in the second half of 2022. Overall, we are making progress, and I am confident that our strategy and priorities are positioning the company for a strong, sustainable, long-term growth, cash flow generation, profitability enhancement and shareholder return. This transformation journey has just started, and significant efforts are still ahead of us. Our success will be dependent on staying agile while maintaining a disciplined approach, which ensures we stay focused on our key set of priorities. Our team has seen significant changes over the second half of 2022, and they will lead us through the next phase of the transformation in 2023. I would like to take a moment to thank all of our leaders and employees across the globe and recognize them for their focus, commitment and hard work, especially over the last 7 months to 8 months. Our 2022 full year revenue reached $16.9 billion, up 11% versus a record of 2021, led by the outdoor power equipment acquisitions as well as 9% organic growth in the Industrial segment, and a 7% improvement in price realization. However, these top line growth drivers were partially muted by significant retractions in consumer and DIY demand, as well as certain supply chain constraints we experienced in early 2022. Our margins were significantly impacted by inflation, and when we chose to prioritize inventory reductions by lowering manufacturing production levels in this last four to five months of 2022, this was to allow us to generate solid free cash flow as we experienced in the fourth quarter. These negative profitability impacts resulted in a full year adjusted diluted earnings per share being down year-over-year to $4.62. For the fourth quarter, revenues were in line with the prior year at $4 billion. Demand from our professional end markets remained healthy. With our differentiated offerings and improved product availability, we successfully executed our promotional plans in support of the holiday season for our retail partners. Adjusted EPS for the period was a loss of $0.10, a result of our planned prioritization efforts around inventory reduction and cash generation. Notably, we lowered inventory by $500 million as compared to the end of the third quarter. We entered 2023 prepared to navigate a challenging macroeconomic backdrop as interest rate hikes begin to yield their intended effects. That said, we are committed to advancing our transformation. While there is more work to be done, we have a clear road map forward. We are watching the demand environment and global economic dynamics very closely. Although, current demand remains consistent with levels experienced in the back half of last year, we are planning for all scenarios, which balance the potential continuation of the current trends with the prospect of a further demand slowdown due to intensifying macro pressures. While changes in demand are difficult to predict, our base case or midpoint of guidance assumes a decline in volume versus 2022 as we believe markets will continue to be challenged during 2023 as new housing starts are projected to decline 15% to 25% and repair and remodel activity will decline modestly year-over-year, we are also prepared to respond if revenue impacts are worse or better than our base case to ensure we appropriately manage the risks and opportunities that could arise. This guidance will have a P&L loss in the front half, which is impacted by our strategic choice to continue to reduce our inventory levels. For the full year, we are guiding an adjusted EPS range of zero up to $2. Our free cash flow guidance is much stronger at $500 million up to $1 billion in 2023, well ahead of net income as we drive another $750 million up to $1 billion of inventory reduction during the year. As you have heard me say many times over the past year, we believe the long-term view for the industries, which our products serve is very positive with powerful generational shifts in the housing, more time at home due to hybrid work, an aging housing stock that needs repair and remodel, the continued improvement in aerospace demand and the acceleration of electrification within the automotive markets. We also have powerful secular drivers in Tools & Outdoor from the shift to cordless power tools and electric powered outdoor equipment as we leverage our brands and innovation to gain market share. Our priorities in 2023 will continue to be aligned with our messaging over the last six months; one, strong focus on cash flow through inventory reduction to assist with ongoing debt deleveraging; two, sequential improvement in our gross margins as we drive further supply chain transformation initiatives; and three, get back to gaining market share in all major categories of our Tools & Outdoor business. Our 2023 guidance base case is planning for an improved profitability performance in the back half of the year as we see more benefits from the transformation program. We believe our annualized EBITDA will achieve a run rate of close to $1.5 billion in the back half. That will be a major step forward in returning our company back to 2019 EBITDA levels, which were just above $2 billion. Given the significant benefits expected to be realized beyond 2023 from our supply chain transformation program, there appears to be a very reasonable glide path to exceed 2019 levels for EBITDA. Our teams around the world remain focused on executing our primary areas of long-term strategic focus, continuing to advance innovation, electrification, and global market penetration to achieve organic growth of two to three times the market growth, streamlining and simplifying the organization as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our customers and end users; accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return gross margins to historical 35% plus levels, while improving fill rates to better match inventory with customer demand; and then prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization. We are making deliberate strategic investments in our businesses to position the company to fully capitalize on these long-term opportunities to gain share within the industries that we serve and to accelerate our organic growth. With that in mind, last year, we invested approximately $350 million in research and development, up over 25% versus 2021 and well ahead of our total sales growth. This increase in R&D will ensure we continue to fund incremental investments beyond our core and breakthrough innovation, electrification across the portfolio, and market leadership, including digital and end user activation. This is an area where we have a long legacy of key investments to maintain our market-leading innovation ecosystem. We clearly took another step forward in 2022 and we will again in 2023. Our business transformation remains on track and we are building momentum towards delivering approximately $1 billion in annualized savings by the end of 2023. That will support both gross and operating margin expansion once our inventory destock is complete. Let's spend some time on the topic of innovation. We are continuing to release new products and bring advancements and innovation to our industries. Today, I will highlight a few exciting launches. As it relates to outdoor electrification, we are introducing new CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT outdoor offerings. For the 2023 season, CRAFTSMAN will carry a new range of lithium-ion electric ride-on mowers and an expansion of our 20-volt CRAFTSMAN Outdoor Essentials, notably new brushless string trimmers and blowers as well as a new cordless pressure washer. For the PRO, we are continuing to expand the DEWALT FLEXVOLT 20-volt MAX system, including the addition of a new pruning chainsaw that is lightweight and compact with an 8-inch bar and a high-efficiency brushless motor. Shifting to professional job site products and solutions, this is another key area for long-term growth. We recently debuted a range of revolutionary tools, accessories, and storage solutions for pros in the commercial concrete and construction industries as we continue to electrify the job site. We are expanding the FLEXVOLT product family with the launch of the world's first cordless in-line SCS MAX Chipping Hammer and Cordless Hexbreaker Hammer. We are also introducing the most powerful cordless DEWALT large angle grinder. All three of these new cordless tools include Perform and Protect safety features as well. Additionally, we have a new DEWALT ToughSystem Solution for storing, charging, and transporting DEWALT 20-volt and FLEXVOLT batteries. And lastly, our DEWALT product team partnered with CONVERGE, a leading concrete material and operations optimization company, to develop and unveil new concrete DNA compatible sensors. This new product allows DEWALT pros to begin work sooner as users can directly measure concrete hardening using advanced artificial intelligence rather than relying on estimations. In addition, this product helps reduce cement consumption by tailoring the exact amount needed. Together with CONVERGE, we are helping to tackle the challenge of reducing carbon emissions through our product innovation. As the worldwide leader in tools and outdoor, these are prime examples of the types of core and breakthrough innovations that we expect to continue to introduce to our customers and deliver for our end users. Now, diving a bit deeper into our business transformation. The team has made great progress. We realized $200 million of savings in the second half of 2022 from efficiency benefits, including our organizational changes, as well as indirect cost savings. We expect to deliver cumulative SG&A savings of $500 million by the end of 2023, covering simplification of the corporate structure, streamlined leadership spans of controls and organizational layers and the reduction of indirect spend. Our new organizational structure is now in place, and the teams are activating our priorities. As you saw in our recent announcements, we have brought on two new business leaders who are critical for our transformation. Patrick Hallinan was named our incoming Chief Financial Officer. Patrick is a seasoned executive who has led global high-performing finance functions across top consumer brands. Patrick joins us in April from Fortune Brands Innovations, where he currently serves as their CFO, and is the ideal candidate for the next leader of our finance function. John Lucas joined us as our new CHRO and brings a highly distinguished track record with world-class experience in organizational and human capital management. John will be instrumental to enabling our culture and values and to the long-term success of our business. I want to thank Corbin Walburger and Deborah Wintner for their leadership and significant contributions during this critical transformation period for the company. I look forward to continuing to work with them as key Stanley Black & Decker leaders. Turning to our supply chain transformation. We have line of sight to deliver cumulative savings of $500 million by the end of 2023 and $1.5 billion by 2025. Building off the momentum from last quarter, we activated our transformation with a sense of urgency to optimize our operations, which better serve our customers while also being efficient and agile with our footprint and cost structure. After approving and initiating action on our SKU reductions, we now have approximately 50,000 SKUs that we are no longer manufacturing and are approved for decommission. Throughout 2023, we will work to transition our customers to the products that deliver the most value for our end users. As we shared last quarter, the strategic sourcing team activated quick wins. We are pleased to share that, this early traction has already generated $40 million in savings. Wave one is now fully activated and addresses approximately $2 billion of spend, which is covered by 20 RFPs that are due back this quarter. We also successfully advanced our facility optimization and distribution network planning. The detailed feasibility analysis nearing completion this quarter, with execution of the plan to follow shortly thereafter. Lastly, we have heightened our focus on manufacturing excellence, reemphasizing SBD Kaizen and Lean manufacturing practices at our factories. Activation at four plants will be complete this quarter. And in March, we will initiate the next wave. We have exited the acute phase of pandemic-driven supply constraints. And as such, refocusing our plans on continuous improvement rigor will enable the acceleration of value across the network. You can expect us to continue to take strides forward, and we will provide you with updates towards achieving our cumulative $1 billion of savings by the end of 2023 on our path to delivering total program savings of $2 billion by 2025. I will now pass it to Corbin, who will take you through more detailed commentary on the fourth quarter and full year performance as well as our 2023 guidance. Corbin?
Corbin Walburger: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk through the details of our business segment performance. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, fourth quarter revenues were in line with last year at $3.4 billion, benefiting from a 7% improvement from price actions and an eight-point contribution from the MTD and Excel outdoor acquisitions. Both of these acquisitions are now a part of organic growth beginning in December. These factors were offset by a 12% decline in volume and a negative 3% impact from currency. From a full year perspective, Tools & Outdoor achieved record revenue of $14.4 billion, driven by a 7% improvement from price actions, and 21% growth contributed by our outdoor acquisitions, which was offset by softer consumer demand and currency. Looking at the regions, Latin America achieved 4% organic growth. Although Europe declined 3% organically, performance improved sequentially from the third quarter, and we believe the more significant impacts from UK channel destocking are now behind us. North America was down 7% as a result of lower consumer and DIY market demand, as well as the third quarter carrying heavier holiday promotional shipments compared to last year. US retail point of sale was supported by price increases and professional demand. Compared to a pre-COVID 2019 baseline, the fourth quarter POS growth was consistent with the growth levels experienced in the third quarter of 2022. Aggregate weeks of supply in these channels ended 1.5 weeks below 2019 levels. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 1% in the quarter as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs, planned production curtailments and lower volume. For the year, operating margin was 8.4%, down versus prior year. Turning to the strategic business units. For the full year, Power Tools declined 5% organically due to weakness in consumer and DIY and front half constraints related to electronic components. These volume impacts were partially offset by the benefits of our price increases and the continued performance of our strong DEWALT cordless innovation across our FLEXVOLT, ATOMIC and XTREME product families as well as our new and differentiated power stack battery packs. Hand tools declined 5% organically in the year. Consumer related headwinds were partially offset by price realization as well as new product innovation, notably the DEWALT Impact Connect, which consists of accessories that attach to an impact driver, allowing up faster cutting than standard hand tools. We also benefited from innovation in storage solutions such as mobile tool storage within the DEWALT Tough system and the CRAFTSMAN Premium S2000 metal storage platform. The Outdoor business declined 7% organically on a pro forma basis for 2022 due to the difficult outdoor season outlined earlier in the year. The fourth quarter marked the one-year anniversary of the MTD and Excel acquisitions, and we're pleased with the progress made to advance the outdoor platform integration. We now have a combined dealer channel sales team and launched one go-to-market approach to grow share. We've activated a brand portfolio strategy, leveraging DEWALT, Cub Cade,t and Hustler in the Pro and high-end resi market segment while targeting CRAFTSMAN, Troy-Bilt, WolfGarden, and Black & Decker for the residential end user. I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for their dedication to this process and ongoing commitment to delivering the best products for our customers. Now, shifting to Industrial, which had another strong quarter, recording 10% organic growth and double-digit adjusted operating margin. Segment revenue declined 1% versus last year as nine points of price realization and one point of volume were offset by five points from currency and six points from the oil and gas divestiture. The team leveraged the price increases and volume growth to overcome commodity inflation and higher supply chain costs to deliver adjusted operating margin of 11.5%, up sequentially 40 basis points and up 220 basis points versus last year. Looking within the segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 9% in the quarter, led by aerospace growth of 37% and auto growth of 14%, which were partially offset by industrial markets. Aerospace fasteners delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement as the recovery in commercial OEM production continues. The auto fasteners' strong quarter, demonstrated by the business' ability to gain share in a dynamic environment and outpaced global light vehicle production in the quarter and for the full year. Attachment tools organic revenues were up 18%, driven by strategic pricing actions. While orders particularly from our dealer channel partners have been moderating, our backlog remains above 2019 levels. We continue to make progress with our inventory reduction in the fourth quarter, taking out nearly $500 million and resulting in a total second half inventory reduction of $775 million. Our production curtailment actions have been successful, helping to reduce DSI by approximately 20 days in the quarter and it was good to see the significant inventory reduction in the second half translate into free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter. As we look to the front half of 2023, we are targeting another $500 million reduction with the majority of this progress to be made in the second quarter. Although we typically see a seasonal inventory build as we prepare for the outdoor and spring selling season, we have the ability to work down our input materials and components as well as drive commercial actions to sell through finished goods. Our full year 2023 inventory reduction target is $750 million to $1 billion, which will drive significant cash flow generation that will be used to pay down debt and further strengthen our balance sheet. The timing of this reduction is demand-dependent. In a few moments, I'll cover how these assumptions impact the 2023 guidance range. Turning to gross margins. We expect the impact of planned production curtailments and higher cost inventory liquidations will continue to weigh on margins through the first half of 2023, resulting in margins in the low 20s. Production curtailments in the fourth quarter were down approximately 30% versus the long-term average and impacted gross margins by approximately six to seven points in the quarter. In our base case, we expect to improve from these levels but not fully eased production curtailments until the third quarter of 2023, which should support a gross margin recovery into the mid to high 20s in the back half. The normalized production and better gross margins could potentially shift earlier or later in the year depending on the overall demand environment and the speed of destocking. We have the teams focused on inventory reduction, cash generation, and balance sheet health as we work to drive gross margins to our historical 35% plus target level in 2025. I'll now walk through how the company is planning for three demand scenarios for our 2023 guidance as the macroeconomic outlook remains dynamic. Our base case scenario assumes a modestly unfavorable market demand environment, compared to what we experienced during the second half of last year. In this scenario, we are assuming total organic growth to be down low single digits with the first quarter being the toughest comp. Tools & Outdoor total organic revenue, inclusive of positive price is expected to be down low single digits, while Industrial is planned for low single-digit growth. Specifically, for Tools & Outdoor, this would imply a full year volume decline of approximately 5%, ahead of our forecast for the market. For the second half, volume is expected to be down 3% to 3.5%. In this base case, we would maintain our production curtailments with the goal of returning to normalized levels in the third quarter. As a result, the under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs would continue to constrain first half 2023 operating margins to low single digits. As production returns to normalized levels in the back half of the year, we expect operating margin rate to improve to the mid to high single-digit range. While our teams are aggressively focused on capturing deflation, this scenario does not include moderating commodity prices benefiting the P&L until late 2023 after the destock, and can be a positive driver heading into 2024. As we monitor the demand environment, we will be measured in the timing and magnitude of our investments, reinvesting into our businesses at the point of impact as part of our transformation strategy, and our base case scenario includes approximately $125 million of annualized reinvestment targeted at commercial leadership, driving innovation and complexity reduction. Shifting to our second half acceleration scenario. This contemplates the possibility of a stronger demand environment supporting organic growth in the second half of 2023. Total organic growth would be relatively flat for the year. To support the improved second half demand, production levels would normalize towards the end of the second quarter. This scenario would position us to deliver high single-digit operating margins in the second half as well as an elevated level of reinvestment to accelerate our transformation. Lastly, we are preparing a downside case that reflects a deceleration of demand due to elevated recessionary pressures. In this case, we expect full year organic revenues to decline by mid-single digits with volume declines in both the tools and outdoor and industrial segments. If this were to occur, our production curtailments would likely continue through the end of 2023, extending the time line of our gross margin recovery. Under this scenario, we would opt to conservatively meter the level of reinvestment until we had more clarity on the extent and duration of the macro impacts and economic cycle. Overall, we feel it's prudent to consider this range of potential 2023 demand possibilities production and reinvestment levels as we continue to prioritize inventory reduction and cash generation. As such, we are guiding full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of zero to $2. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be negative $1.65 to positive $0.85, inclusive of one-time charges from the global supply chain optimization and the remaining outdoor integration-related expenses. The current pre-tax estimate for one-time charges is approximately $225 million to $325 million with $50 million to $100 million in non-cash charges. Now some added quarterly context from our base case. For the first quarter, we're expecting similar levels of operating profit to what we delivered in the fourth quarter. However, we do not expect the discrete tax benefits to repeat, resulting in a first quarter adjusted loss of $0.75 per share at the midpoint. We believe profitability can improve sequentially into the second quarter, resulting in a stronger performance. In total, we expect our actions [Technical Difficulty] but will translate to positive first half free cash flow driven by $500 million of inventory reduction, most of which will come in the second quarter. As we get through the first half destock, we expect earnings to inflect positively in the second half of the year, generating an annualized EBITDA run rate of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. We view this as a jumping off point to further improve with our transformation. Our guidance calls for $500 million to $1 billion of free cash flow in 2023, primarily from inventory reduction. We're focused on our key priorities; number one, generate strong cash flow through inventory reduction to assist with ongoing debt deleveraging; number two, sequential improvement in our gross margins as we drive further supply chain transformation initiatives; and number three, focus on gaining market share in all major categories. We're planning for the dynamic operating environment to continue and feel we have the strategy in place to successfully navigate our path forward as we remain focused on driving above market long-term organic growth. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Don.
Don Allan: Thank you, Corbin. So in summary, we successfully advanced our cost reduction and business transformation strategy over the last quarter and made meaningful progress on a number of key objectives, including inventory reduction, cash generation, debt reduction and streamlining our organizational structure and supply chain. We have given you an indication today of what annualized EBITDA could be on the first step of this journey. We believe we can build from 2023's back half as our supply chain savings continue to accrue and contribute to the restoration of our gross margin to the 35% plus level. As we look ahead, we aim to get our levels of EBITDA back to 2019 levels and beyond as we continue to transform our business. While the macroeconomic environment is uncertain and 2023 will clearly bring us challenges, we are prepared to navigate forward and believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization, as well as reinvest in our core businesses will enable us to deliver strong shareholder value over the long-term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.
Don Allan: Good morning.
Julian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe just my question would be around -- I guess, two quick parts. One would be, it looks like you're guiding for positive price, I think, in Tools this year, maybe the conviction in that given what seems to be a lot of inventory kind of out there at customers and competitors. And then also, the second part would just be I heard what you said on the annualized EBITDA run rate. Are we still assuming a sort of $7 plus or so of EPS potential at Stanley in the medium-term based off that, or has that view changed?
Don Allan : Yes. So I'll start and then Corbin probably will add a little color too on both of those topics. But I would say that our price model has about 1.5 to 2 points in it for the year for 2023. And based on where we are now with commodity prices, which you've seen some improvement or reduction, but overall, when you look at the basket of commodities for us, we really don't see any significant deflation and a little bit of inflation here in the first half of the year. So we still see based on that, that we can maintain price throughout the year. Now your question on the angle of there's a lot of inventory in the channel, and therefore, we're going to have to take specific promotional actions that might be unusual to drive inventory out of the channel, which, therefore, would impact our price. We don't really see that in our plan today. So we see normal promotional activity in the spring and the Father's Day season and then, of course, in the later stages around Thanksgiving and other holidays at the end of the year. And so at this point, we do not believe there's a need to do anything unusual around pricing activities to push things to the channel. One thing I'll just point out related to inventory levels in the channel. For us specifically, we actually feel where the inventory is in our customers is pretty reasonable at this point, and it's actually down a little bit from 2019 levels. And so probably about a week to two weeks down from those levels, which is a good place to be. And we feel like we've gone into the year with the adequate amount of inventory in their stores. And what we're dealing with is higher levels of inventory in our own distribution network that we have to work through during 2023 and probably some early stages of 2024. But the vast majority of that reduction is going to happen this year in 2023. The second question was related to…
Corbin Walburger : Long-term EPS, medium-term.
Don Allan : Long-term EPS and the $7 and some commentary around that. So I think as you start to dissect the guidance we're providing at the midpoint, you'll see that the back half is getting itself close to a couple of dollars EPS for this year. And if you annualize that and factor in seasonality from the outdoor season that happens in the first half of the year primarily, you're probably trending something for 2024 that's closer to $5. And now that assumes that we deal with an environment that we have guided here, which is the midpoint is pretty muted from a volume perspective. We -- as you heard from Corbin in his presentation, the back half is assuming for the Tools & Outdoor business that the organic performance will be down about three points. And as a result, that's really us seeing a continuation of current trends on the consumer side, but also likely some slowing on the pro side as you start to look at lower housing start numbers, lower repair remodel numbers year-over-year and as -- and we think this year, we'll see a negative organic performance at our base case. Now if that doesn't play out, and the performance is stronger, you heard from Corbin that it could be two to three points better for the year, and obviously, the back half would be a better performance as well. If that played out, and then you went into 2024 with that type of momentum, there could be a case where you actually do work yourself closer back to the $7. So I think we're probably, at this point, somewhere around $5, with it eventually having the possibility, if the volume and demand is stronger than our base case, where it could be higher than that. Anything you want to add to that, Corbin?
Corbin Walburger: No. The only thing, Julian, maybe for your model from a pricing standpoint, we're going to have some price carryover in the first half of a point or two, and then that obviously anniversaries out by the second half.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open.
Tim Wojs: Yeah. Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for all the details. Don, maybe just following on to your question, or to some of the answers from the last question. Just what are you seeing from the Pro today? And I guess, what -- within the scenarios that you've outlined, I mean, what are you assuming that the Pro does as you work through 2023?
Don Allan: Yeah. I would actually say coming out of the gate here in 2023, it was just one month under our belt, we're actually not seeing any slowing of the Pro. So the Pro business continues to be healthy. As we talk to our customers, they say the same thing. What we are, though, forecasting in our model is a slowing down of some of that activity. And when you look at the organic projection that we have for our Tools & Outdoor business, we expect it to slow down as we get deeper into the year and for that to continue in the back half of the year in a modest way. And so I think that's a reasonable assumption when you give -- when you start to look at things like housing starts and the projections for housing starts, repair, remodel, what our customers are saying and their expectations are around likely performance year-over-year and what you hear from many of the peers in the space as well. I mean, everybody seems to be thinking that the market will probably be down somewhere 3% to 5%. And that's kind of where we are with our Tools & Outdoor business. And it aligns very much with the trends you're seeing in construction. And I think it is a good base case to start with, but as I said before, it could be better than that if the Pro doesn't weaken as much as I just described. It also could be worse than that, which I think our downside case covers that as Corbin articulated very well in his presentation.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning and thanks for the question. Don, on the inventory reduction, I think you're still going to be carrying $5 billion of inventory at year-end. So just wondering why not be even more aggressive on that inventory reduction? And is there a risk that, that this could carry forward into 2024? And maybe just address the dividend. We've got a few questions this morning. Just is there any scenario you look at/or any scenario where you might have to revisit the dividend this year? Thanks for asking the questions.
Don Allan: Sure. I think on the inventory part of your question, I feel like going after $1 billion, $750 million to $1 billion is the reasonable level that we should pursue given where our business model is today and our supply chain is today. Could we, over time, over the next 12 months, get to a number above $1 billion? Yes, that's possible. It probably wouldn't be dramatically above that number, though. Now as you go into 2024, I don't think there's a need for another major step down in inventory. I think what we're going to see, if things go the way we would like them to go in 2023, we'll get a substantial chunk of inventory out in the first half of the year, a lot of that probably in Q2. We'll do some more at the end of the year in the fourth quarter, which tends to be part of the normal routine of our company. And beyond that, I think it's just going to get back to managing and optimizing the supply chain to maximize the efficiency of it. And we'll continue to drive down inventory. But it won't be at the -- having an impact on our production. It will be more managing it efficiently, looking at how we do certain types of activities that drive reductions of $250 million to $500 million each year for maybe the subsequent two years, more in that magnitude. And I think that's the right way to look at it. I really would like to get production levels back to normal in the back half of 2023. That is our goal. We think it's achievable based on our base case right now. And we'll continue to look at that. Obviously, Corbin articulated at the downside case, if we saw demand being even worse then the production levels would have to stay lower probably through the remainder of the year. But in our base case, I think there's a good chance we can get production levels back to normal in the summertime of 2023. On the dividend, very good question. Thank you for asking that. The dividend continues to be a very important part of our capital allocation strategy. We believe that it's a necessary thing for us to maintain the level of the dividend that we have today. We'll continue to evaluate that through the remainder of the year, but there's no change in that strategy at this stage. Obviously, buying back stock is not an opportunity for us given the leverage we have on our balance sheet. And so therefore, returning value back to our shareholders, the main lever we have today is our dividend.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan, your line is open, please shut your mute button.
Mike Rehaut: Sorry, about that. Appreciate the taking my question. Just wanted to make sure I fully appreciated the base case in terms of -- I think you said earlier that it incorporates a view around repair remodel activity being down also low single-digits. I just want to make sure I understand that's right. I mean, obviously, you have existing home sale turnover trending down 30% year-over-year currently. And I think that might be, at least in our view, a little optimistic. But just wanted to understand your assumptions behind that? And also, if I could just kind of shift gears on the modeling side, I appreciate any views on some of the other line items from a guidance standpoint, corporate expense, interest expense, other net, some of those line items would be helpful? Thanks.
Dennis Lange: Hey, Mike, I'll take that. On the base case, as we said, the whole company we view in the base cases being down two to three points organically. Volume is more than that. There's some coverage from price. If you look at tools organically, tools will be down about three to five points, volume down a little bit back from price. And then the second half, as Don mentioned, volumes down in the kind of 3% to 3.5%. And from an Industrial standpoint, we see that being up low single digits, both from price and from volume. So that's the case for how we got to the base case.
Don Allan: I think the other thing that I would add is we – if you look back at history of Stanley Black & Decker and if you put the Great Recession in 2009 in a totally different category, because we had a significant amount of overbuild residential inventory, in particular, in housing and say that's an unusual situation that's probably not indicative of where we are today because we don't have that type of overbuild situation and we don't have the same type of leverage issues within the consumer in the housing market as well. The other recessions that Stanley Black & Decker has historically experienced, the average decline has been about 3% to 5%. And so when you think about it from that perspective and recognize that we just went through a period of time where we're dealing with supply constraints and then a bit of a consumer dip in the back half of 2022, now we believe we're going to see a bit of a pro dip here in 2023, we're kind of aligned with our 3% to 5% in 2023 with that historical point of view. There hasn't been many recessions that have impacted housing beyond the 5% except for the one that I mentioned, which was the Great Recession, which is very different than usual. So it's just something that we need to keep in mind as you factor all the different scenarios that Corbin went through in the presentation and really center around our base case. Our base case is very consistent with what history would say.
Corbin Walburger: Hey, Mike, just to touch on your other question around specific line items. As we said, the corporate expenses, we've really targeted to get back to 2019 levels. That's where we expect them and then interest because rates have gone up and the quantum has gone up, you'll probably see an increase in interest expense of about 20%.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi. Good morning everybody.
Don Allan: Good morning.
Rob Wertheimer: To the extent you can comment, how was your pricing in Tools & Storage achieved in 4Q compare with your channel partners, your home center pricing achieved? I mean, is there still a risk of major discounting to clear out inventory or otherwise reflect an environment, or do you think that we've come close to balance there?
Don Allan: I think as we look at the pricing dynamics in Tools & Outdoor, we are monitoring all the different things that are happening across the different product families and categories related to price. And we really look at what our competitors are doing. We're obviously paying attention to monitoring what we're doing as well and making sure it's consistent with our expectations. But we didn't see any major turbulence in the market around pricing from our competitors during the fourth quarter. We do see here random, kind of, what I would call promotional activities to move inventory through some of our customers' stores. So you saw some of that happen in the fourth quarter. But it didn't dramatically shift the pricing dynamic, the list pricing dynamic in particular in that time horizon. That's something we will continue to monitor here going into 2023 and make sure we stay focused on that throughout the year. And it's always something that we have to factor into our decision-making. But we think the promotional calendar that we've built with our customers so far for this year. And the other activities that we're able to do will allow us to achieve the level of inventory reduction we would like to get to, which is $750 million to $1 billion. And we obviously have to be agile and flexible and look at what happens in the market. But at this stage, we're not seeing any irrational pricing activity.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. So I wanted to ask about the gross margin recovery during 2023. When we see gross margin going from the 20% currently to the mid to high 20s by the back half of the year, could you provide just a bit more color on the buildup here between the improvement of just getting past the destock versus some of the benefits of the Phase 1 supply chain transformation plan starting to come through? Thank you.
Dennis Lange: Yes, you bet, Chris. So the gross margins, as we said, in the second half of 2022, on average, we're around 22%. And there was probably about four-point penalty driven by the production curtailments and liquidating the high-cost inventory. As we go through the course of 2023, that four-point penalty slowly starts to decline to about 3.5 and then to 2.5 points by the end of the year. And again, it's a mix between -- we don't -- as I mentioned in my view on our guidance, we don't expect production curtailments to continue throughout the whole course of the year. So that will help us. And then as we liquidate the high-cost inventory, that also helps us. So by the end of the year, on an incurred basis, we will see margins slightly above 25%, but there will still be a little bit of penalty that would get us into the high 20s.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Dan Oppenheim: Great. Thanks very much. I was wondering of the plans in different scenarios in terms of inventory, where you've talked about those situations and what -- how it impact production, but it doesn't seem as though you would change your goals in terms of that $750 million to $1 billion reduction of inventory. Why not think about reducing inventory by more? Is there something in the supply chain that's leading you to thinking about keeping a higher level than where you've had historically? What's the overall thought there in terms of why not more inventory reduction?
Don Allan: Yes. I would say the range actually is indicative of the range of EPS. So if the low end of range of EPS played out that Corbin articulated, then we'd probably be looking at $750 million of inventory reduction. Even though we would be continuing curtailments, the demand levels would be much lower. And so you have two or three points lower demand versus the base case. On the high end of the case, I think the $1 billion becomes very achievable because you're dealing with much higher levels of demand where organic for Tools & Outdoor would probably be flat year-over-year. And therefore, the $1 billion feels more achievable in that environment, and you're getting your production levels back to normal levels in the back half of the year or maybe sooner. And so that's where the range kind of plays out. As I mentioned earlier in response to Nigel's question, I do think if demand is stronger in the back half, we could see a possible improvement above the $1 billion. I don't think it would be a dramatic number, but a few hundred million dollars above that, it certainly makes sense. And so that's really where that range comes from. It really correlates well with the EPS range, which correlates well to the demand associated with those three different scenarios.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning guys.
Don Allan: Good morning.
Nicole DeBlase: Just to maybe piggyback on one of the earlier questions. Can you just give a little bit more color on the ramp of the cost savings that you guys expect to achieve throughout 2023, would take into the base case? And then any help at all on as we think about 2024 and 2025? It might be a bit early to give us explicit numbers. But is more of the plan coming through in 2024, or is it more back-end loaded towards the end of the three-year period? Thank you.
Corbin Walburger: Hey, Nicole, it's Corbin. I'll take it. So as Don mentioned, in 2022 in the second half, we've got about $200 million of savings. And as we look into 2023, from an SG&A standpoint, we expect to get about $300 million. About 70% of that will come in the front half and about 30% will come in the back half as you lap 2022. And then on the COGS side, we expect about $450 million, and that will build throughout the year. So Q1 will be a little bit higher and then it will build in 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q will be pretty even.
Don Allan: Yeah. And I think for 2024 and 2025, I mean, we're trying -- obviously, with the numbers that you just heard, we believe we'll have $1 billion of value creation by the end of 2023. And then there's another $1 billion related to the supply chain transformation in the subsequent two years of 2024 and 2025. Right now, based on the plan we have that our operations and business teams have collectively worked together on, that $1 billion has a specific level of detail and actions that are associated with it that we believe are close to being rock solid. And, therefore, we do think in those two years, we'll probably get about $500 million or so of that in each year. And we'll see as we get deeper into 2023, whether more comes in 2024 versus 2025, time will tell. But at this stage, it feels like the way that we're phasing this because it is a pretty significant level of transformation that we're doing across our supply chain, and we need to be thoughtful as to when we do different phases of it, so we don't cause any major disruption to our customers, which is why it's going to take three years to do. At the same time, it's also why the value probably would be pretty evenly prorated over a three-year time horizon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.
Eric Bosshard: Good morning. Thanks. Curious on, Don, you talked about 2024 of $5 to $7 in rough frame. And I know six months ago, that was the concept for 2023. What's so notably different in 2023 that pushed out that level of earnings to 2024?
Don Allan: Yeah. I would say there's a couple of dynamics. I mean, obviously, volume continues to be challenging. We think volume is going to be challenging for 2023. I talked about what I think is going to happen with the Pro market in 2023, and we'll see a modest recession aligned with what the historical recessions are for Stanley Black & Decker of down 3% to 5%. Clearly, that's a significant factor in all of this. We're also -- we've decided to be much more aggressive in the inventory reduction than we were thinking three, five months ago, where we were going to be more methodical in that reduction. We're being more aggressive. We're really trying to get a large part of this done by the middle of 2023 to get production levels, as I said, back to normal in the back half of 2023. And those are probably the two main drivers of the difference in the timing.
Eric Bosshard : Great. That's helpful color.
Don Allan : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn hand the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-27 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2022 third quarter webcast. On the webcast, in addition to myself, Don Allan, President and CEO; and Corbin Walburger, Vice President and Interim CFO. On our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don and Corbin will review our 2022 third quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.
Don Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from today's release, we made tangible progress during the third quarter towards our strategy around focusing our business and transforming our supply chain. We are building positive momentum as we deliver improved customer fill rates, deployed a new organizational structure, implemented cost controls and actively reduced our inventories. In addition, we made significant progress reducing debt, utilizing $3.3 billion in proceeds from our strategic divestitures. All key priorities we set out heading into the third quarter. All of this is not yet apparent in the financials, but we are encouraged by a few items. One, our headcount reductions are largely complete. Two, inventory is coming down. Three, cash generation was positive in September, and we believe this can continue in the fourth quarter and next year. And four, gross margin will be the last to turn as we face the high cost of destocking, but we expect to be through that and pivot to better performance by the middle of next year. While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, notably softer North America consumer and European markets, combined with stubborn cost inflation, there were relative bright spots with continued strength in Professional Construction and Industrial customer demand, as well as incremental progress unlocking global supply chain constraints. Our actions to alleviate semiconductor constraints are progressing as expected and are contributing to results through our improved fill rates as well as slightly better organic revenue performance in Q3. Third quarter revenue was $4.1 billion, up 9%, driven by our Outdoor Equipment acquisitions. Organic revenue declined 2%, which was an improvement over what we delivered in the first half, due to increased professional power tool supply and a solid performance by the Industrial business as organic growth was up 14%. Price realization sequentially improved 8% versus the prior year. U.S. retail point of sale was relatively consistent with the levels we saw exiting 2Q, supported by price and professional demand, even as softer DIY consumer demand persisted. Europe continues to operate in a challenging environment as a result of the broader macro, the war in the Ukraine as well as the continued impacts from customer destocking due to elevated channel inventories. Our improved supply position has set us up for strong merchandising support for the holidays across all major brands and categories, with much of the product already shipped to our customers in September and October. We have gained back some key Isle end caps and off-shelf promotion areas after 12 months of limited promotional activity. During the third quarter, we successfully delivered $65 million in pretax savings from our global cost initiatives and reduced our inventory by approximately $300 million. In a few moments, I will dive deeper into our progress related to the Company's transformation plan announced in Q2. Operating margin was 6.2% in the third quarter, pressured by input cost inflation, which was partially offset by customer price increases. Additionally, our margins were impacted from our inventory destock as we began the process of significantly reducing manufacturing production levels in June and during the third quarter. This resulted in third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.76. The divestitures of Electronic Security, Access Technologies and Oil & Gas businesses were successfully completed in the third quarter, which further focuses Stanley Black & Decker's portfolio on our leading Tools & Outdoor and Industrial businesses. Proceeds from the transaction supported $3.3 billion of sequential debt reduction. These deals also conclude the strategic portfolio moves we've been executing over the last 12 months and further intensifies the operational execution focus of our company as we move forward. In terms of financial guidance, because of the ongoing changes to the demand environment, the impact related to foreign exchange and incremental costs due to our more aggressive pullback on production to accelerate inventory destocking in the first half of 2023, we are revising our 2022 adjusted diluted EPS range down to $4.15 up to $4.65, and updating our free cash flow estimate to approximate to $0.3 billion up to $0.6 billion for the fourth quarter, which includes a substantial tax payment related to the gains on the business sales I previously mentioned. Our near-term priority is cash generation, and September marked a turning point with planned production curtailments beginning to meaningfully contribute to inventory reductions, supporting positive cash generation in the month. The decision to escalate and continue production curtailments in Q4 will clearly carry a negative P&L implication as we incur the impact of our underabsorption of fixed plant costs, while concurrently liquidating higher cost inventory from the balance sheet. Although the immediate P&L impacts are significant, and will be incurred in Q4 and likely in the early stages of 2023, we believe proactively reducing inventory in a disciplined yet swift manner is the right strategy and will put our business in a position to optimize growth and margin expansion going forward. Now, I'd like to review how we are moving forward to accelerate organic growth. We have optimized the corporate structure, focused our operating model and are transforming our supply chain to drive efficiency and fuel reinvestment. As we deploy our new organization structure and operating model, we are elevating three key priorities to sharpen our focus: one, end user obsession and innovation; two, customer focus; and three, delivering operational and functional excellence. These are built upon the non-negotiable priorities and values that make up our culture, such as people focus and talent management, health and safety, integrity, compliance, DE&I and ESG. In the next three years, we expect to redeploy $300 million to $500 million to advance innovation across our iconic brands, accelerate electrification in our Outdoor and Engineered Fastening businesses, rapidly accelerate our end-user market activation and create the supply chain of the future. These investments will position the Company for strong, sustainable, long-term growth, profitability, consistent free cash flow generation and shareholder return. We have a strong track record as the industry leader in breakthrough, world's first innovations in our businesses. From FLEXVOLT to ATOMIC and XTREME to POWERSTACK, we will build upon this strength to deliver an even higher quality of core and breakthrough innovations with shorter development cycles and new technologies. Electrification is a key growth driver across our Tools & Outdoor and Engineered Fastening businesses. We plan to make incremental investments to accelerate our efforts, capitalize on share gain opportunities and fortify our market leadership position as the technology continues to shift and adoption accelerates. Market leadership includes more user activation at the front end of our businesses. As we introduce our new products and innovation, we will bring more digital tools and capabilities as well as additional commercial resources to engage directly with our customers, enhance interactions with our end users and drive market share gains. Lastly, to fully leverage these investments, we need to have a world-class and more agile supply chain that brings us closer to our customers, increases our flexibility in response to demand and enhances our customer service levels, all to drive greater growth for us and for our customers. Aligned with these growth investments and as we execute this strategy, we will be focused on a few key success criteria. One, our powerful innovation engine will position us to grow organic revenue 2x to 3x the market over the long term. Two, our supply chain transformation is a key enabler to improve our customer service levels and operational efficiency to return gross margins back to the 35% plus level, with customer fill rates greater than 95%. Three, we have a long track record of generating strong free cash flow, and we'll continue to target 100% free cash flow conversion to net income over the long term, while ensuring consistent annual performance. We are now a more focused company, executing a clear strategy with both immediate and near-term tactical actions to deliver strong value for our shareholders over the long term. Key to our success is and will continue to be market-leading innovation, and I will now highlight a few exciting new launches on the next slide. As the world's largest tool and outdoor company. We are continuing to push the bounds of our category offerings to serve the full spectrum of our makers and creators, from the DIY consumer to trade users and up to the most demanding pro. We are expanding DEWALT POWERSTACK with the launch of a new 5-amp hour battery. This is the most powerful, longest-lasting 20-volt MAX battery in its class, and is compatible with our 300-tool strong DEWALT 20-volt system. POWERSTACK is the first pouch cell technology, battery of its kind, designed to deliver unparalleled bower density to best serve our most demanding professional customers and is expected to deliver over $100 million of revenue in its first 12 months since launch. Today, the 5-amp hour product is already in the European market and has received great reviews by our customers. We are also continuing to advance our high-power DEWALT FLEXVOLT line. By the end of this year, the portfolio will reach 60 products across power tools and outdoor power equipment, generating approximately $500 million of annual revenue and continuing to grow, approaching nearly 70 products by the end of 2023. The DEWALT FLEXVOLT 15 Amp-hour battery was introduced last year as a world's first innovation. DEWALT FLEXVOLT converts users who are using corded, small-gas engine or pneumatic tools due to a high power need, and they convert them over to battery power. And it is one reason why 3/4 of the DEWALT power tool revenue is cordless today. Our FLEXVOLT technology is also advancing innovation and sustainability across our industrial business, where customers desire to replace existing hydraulic tools with cordless solutions to increase portability and efficiency. To that end, the Stanley infrastructure team recently launched the first cordless automatic rail maintenance tool, the RD60 rail drill, which is powered by DEWALT FLEXVOLT. These are just a few subset of examples where we are continuing to deliver industry-leading innovations to push the bounds of our categories and accelerate our success. Another key enabler to our strategy is generating cost savings by taking the complexity out of our businesses while investing to accelerate our organic growth, recovering gross margins and generating consistent strong free cash flow. From an SG&A perspective, we are executing on our plan to rapidly optimize our organizational structure to become flatter and more agile. The new structure is largely complete, including a leaner corporate team. These actions will generate the $300 million of annualized cost savings as targeted. Rigor around indirect spend is in place. Initial savings of $40 million were realized in Q3 and we are on pace to deliver approximately $200 million by the end of next year. As we shared with many of you, we moved quickly to deploy this new structure, so the organization can focus on its priorities and execution. We remain on track to deliver the cumulative savings of $500 million we set out to achieve last quarter, covering the simplification of the corporate structure, the reduction of indirect spend and the streamlining of spans and layers, all by the end of 2023. Pivoting to supply chain, we also activated this transformation with a sense of urgency. Detailed planning and, in some cases, project execution is underway across all four pillars of the strategy. I will now cover some noteworthy progress in the quarter. Regarding the SKU rationalization, we have approved and initiated action on approximately 50,000 SKUs, which represents roughly half of the targeted reduction. We expect the remaining SKU reductions to occur from now through the end of 2023. Second, within the strategic sourcing initiatives, we are activating quick wins that are already generating savings. In tandem, we are defining the wave one implementation plan for 2023, which covers about 1/3 of the addressable spend. Lastly, we are being thoughtful as we progress the facility consolidation and distribution optimization to ensure we plan effectively for successful execution with our teams and for our customers, even as we work with speed. We have completed the feasibility analysis and are now finalizing detailed planning, with implementation targeted to begin in 2023. Additionally, we expect to take initial actions to begin the optimization of our distribution network in the fourth quarter. We have gained some significant early traction and are on pace to deliver the savings targeted for 2022, and we'll continue to build momentum as we enter 2023. I will now pass it to Corbin, who will take you through more detailed commentary on the third quarter performance, including gross margin and inventory levels, as well as the latest guidance on how we expect to close out 2022.
Corbin Walburger: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk through the details of our third quarter business segment performance. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor, revenue grew 10% to $3.5 billion as the MTD and Excel outdoor acquisitions contributed nearly $600 million of revenue or approximately 18% growth, and price realization contributed 7%. These factors were partially offset by a 12% decline in volume and a negative 3% impact from currency. On an organic basis, we were down low single digits in emerging markets in North America and down 12% in Europe. U. S. retail point-of-sale was supported by professional demand and remained consistent with levels exiting the second quarter of 2022. Aggregate weeks of inventory in these channels remain below 2019 levels. The European results were impacted by retail market pressure due to high levels of customer inventory and inflation as recessionary concerns and the war in Ukraine continue to weigh on consumer spending, particularly in the Northern region. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 6.8%. Excluding charges and acquisitions, margin was 140 basis points better at 8.2%, however, still below the 15.5% level from the same period last year as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs, production curtailment costs and lower volume. Consistent with normal seasonality, the MTD and Excel outdoor businesses deliver only about 40% of full year volume in the back half at operating margin substantially below the annual average as margins in the first half of the year are typically bolstered by peak outdoor seasonal volume leverage. Across the North American channels, organic sales in retail and e-commerce were down versus 2021 levels, with moderate strength in Commercial and Industrial. However, as compared to a pre-pandemic 2019 baseline, organic sales performance was up double digits across these channels. Turning to the strategic business units within our Tools & Outdoor segment. Power Tools declined organically by 2%. This modest decline reflects an improvement versus the front half performance as we're seeing better semiconductor supply, which helped to raise customer fill rates and contributed to positive organic growth in North America. Looking ahead, we expect further progress in the fourth quarter and are serving a normalized merchandising and promotional schedule for our professional products with our customers. Hand tools declined organically by 7%, driven by retail consumer demand softness in European customer destock. These factors were partially offset by strength among professional-oriented customers in the U.S. commercial and industrial channels as well as successful new product launches in our CRAFTSMAN plastic storage. The Outdoor business declined 12% on a pro forma organic basis. Total revenue was impacted by moderated consumer demand like many other discretionary retail categories and lower orders, as our retailers are also working down inventory. The outdoor team is progressing on our platform integration initiatives, and we have a host of new outdoor innovations across our brands and categories in the pipeline to be launched for the 2023 season. Now shifting to Industrial, which had a great quarter, leveraging the cyclical recovery, with 14% organic growth and margin expansion back to the double digits. Segment revenue increased 5% versus last year as nine points of price realization, coupled with five points of volume, were partially offset by six points from currency headwinds and three points from the Oil & Gas divestiture, which closed in August. The team leveraged this growth and our price increases to overcome commodity inflation and deliver adjusted operating margin of 11.1%, up sequentially 180 basis points and up 340 basis points versus last year. Looking within the segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 15%, led by aerospace growth of 28%, auto growth of 22% and 4% growth in general industrial fasteners. The auto fasteners business continues to navigate a dynamic supply environment for our customers and is also leveraging tailwinds related to the recovery in auto manufacturing. Our industrial fastener business is continuing to outperform the Industrial Production Index and is maintaining a healthy backlog, which is up 7% versus last year. Aerospace fasteners delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement. This business continues to focus on capturing the emerging recoveries in both narrow-body and wide-body OEM production. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 12%, driven by 19% growth in attachment tools, which was partially offset by the Oil & Gas divestiture in the latter half of the quarter. Orders from our dealer channel partners are beginning to slow, yet our backlog remains robust, and year-to-date OEM orders are up versus last year. I'll now spend a few moments covering our gross margin and inventory performance and expectations. Third quarter gross margins continued to be pressured by several points as we navigated the impacts from inflation and temporary impacts from under-absorption of fixed costs related to our planned production curtailments. This is a strategic choice as we prioritize cash flow generation through inventory reductions. We're making progress with our inventory reductions, which totaled nearly $300 million in the third quarter. We expect to make further progress in the fourth quarter, which will translate into positive cash flow. While these curtailments put temporary pressure on our margins that are necessary as we get our days of inventory back closer to historical levels. With this goal in mind, we made the strategic choice to extend our planned production curtailments versus our original plan to ensure we make continued progress through the middle of next year. Back in July, we assumed our production levels will begin to normalize at year-end. However, we're now planning to maintain low production levels through the first quarter of 2023. This puts additional pressure on our gross margins and depresses payables for the near term, with the trade-off and capturing a cash generation opportunity as inventory continues to decline. These items also impact our total cash generation forecast for 2022 and we incorporate assumptions for lower working capital reductions, including the previously mentioned impact of payables and a lower earnings base. However, the cash flow generation for the Company is gaining momentum. We generated positive free cash flow in the month of September, and we believe this will continue for the fourth quarter. Our capital deployment priority is debt reduction as we look to get to our targeted 2x debt-to-EBITDA level. In the third quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $3.3 billion, utilizing the cash from our divestitures. We expect to achieve further reductions to our debt levels as we generate cash flow in the fourth quarter and in 2023. Turning to gross margins. We believe that this quarter and the first quarter of 2023 should represent the trough as production curtailments and higher cost inventory liquidations are most impactful over the next six months, pressuring margins to the low 20s. The destock impact is expected to alleviate beginning in the second quarter of 2023, with gross margins recovering into the high 20s before any of the benefits from our supply chain transformation. As you heard from Don, we expect that the supply chain transformation savings will start to accrue as we move through the year and build to approximately $500 million by the end of 2023, which will provide further support for the improved gross margins into the 30s on the journey towards 35% plus gross margins in 2025. We believe our focus on inventory reduction, cash generation and balance sheet health are prudent as we work in parallel on structural supply chain savings to improve our gross margins in 2023 and beyond. I'll now walk through what this means for our 2022 guidance. For full year 2022, we expect low double-digit total revenue growth for the Company. We're updating our adjusted earnings per share full year guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.65. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $0.10 to $0.80, inclusive of one-time charges. The current estimate for pretax charges in 2022 is approximately $755 million to $795 million. On the right side of the slide, we've outlined the key assumption changes to our adjusted EPS versus our prior estimate. Lower fourth quarter revenue, primarily driven by European retail market pressure due to high levels of customer inventory and inflation, reduces EPS by $0.30. Foreign currency translation pressure further reduces EPS by $0.23. Our strategic choice to prioritize inventory reduction and free cash flow generation is accompanied by higher production curtailment costs and inventory destocking costs, which are estimated to be $0.82 of a reduction. Then the 2022 tax impact from lower earnings is expected to increase EPS by $0.25, bringing the revised midpoint to $4.40. We're continuing to expect $150 million to $200 million of gross savings to be achieved in 2022 from our transformation programs, of which $65 million was realized in the third quarter. We have also disclosed other below-the-line planning items for modeling purposes on the slide. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor is expected to realize a mid- to high single-digit organic revenue decline. Margins continue to be down versus prior year as a result of inflation, acquisition mix and volume deleverage. We are continuing to focus on the outdoor acquisition synergy realization as a lever to improve margins within this business unit over the coming years. The Industrial segment organic revenue growth expectation remains unchanged at high single to low double digits. The industrial margin rate is expected to continue to improve sequentially. However, it will be pressured year-over-year largely due to inflation and mix. Turning to cash flow. The fourth quarter free cash flow is expected to approximate $300 million to $600 million, which will support our strong commitment and track record for returning value to our shareholders via cash dividends as well as further debt reduction. As we look into 2023, we've positioned the Company with $1 billion of annualized cost savings, which Don covered earlier. We're also aggressively working to capture the opportunities of recent spot market pullbacks on many of our commodities, such as metals and resins, transportation as well as others. These input savings could benefit us next year after our planned destocking. We believe we are taking the appropriate actions which are in our control to position the Company to navigate a variety of demand environments and contribute to gross margin accretion. Once our visibility improves, we will also invest for share gain by advancing our innovation, electrification and end-user activation. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Don to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks.
Don Allan: Thank you, Corbin. So in summary, a lot of progress was made in our first 90 days and these benefits will become even more apparent within the financials in the coming quarters. Our headcount reductions are largely complete. Inventory is now coming down. Cash generation was positive in September, and we believe this will continue in the fourth quarter and next year. Gross margin will be the last to turn as we face the high cost of destocking but we expect to be through that and pivot to better performance by the middle of next year. And we will continue to focus on debt reduction, further strengthening the balance sheet. All as we continue our commitment to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends. As we move forward, we have a clear strategy, vision and execution plan. And we are laser-focused on optimizing what is within our control. The macroeconomic environment will definitely continue to be choppy and 2023 will clearly bring new challenges. However, we believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization, as well as reinvest in our core businesses, will enable us to deliver strong shareholder value over the long term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Okay. Thanks. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell: For my question, I'd just like to circle back to Slide 9, which was very helpful, and completely agree with the effort to get cash flow up even if it means near-term earnings are down. But I guess two related questions on that. One is the free cash flow was still negative $500 million in Q3. You've got the plus $400 million to $500 million in Q4. So really just trying to test the conviction in that tailwind on free cash given that it was, I think, worse than expected in the third quarter. And then secondly, when you look at that gross margin chart sort of bottoming in Q1 next year, just wondered what you're assuming for the macro on that point. Because I guess the risk would be that as you keep trying to lower inventories, the macro rolls and they stay kind of stubbornly high, so extra on the production is needed. So just trying to test sort of what are you assuming on the macro, on the pro channel for early next year when looking at that gross margin recovery slope?
Don Allan: Thank you, Julian, for the question, and so we'll give you a little more color in response to that. But as I think through the -- you're right with your opening comment, this is really a heavy focus on cash flow right now. And I was very pleased to see that we generated some solid cash flow in the month of September. Our conviction related to the fourth quarter is very strong. I feel like that we've done all the right things to ensure that our inventory continues to go down. We took additional steps in the third quarter to lower production even further, which is obviously having a bigger impact on Q4 versus Q3. We made that decision as we started to get a little more insight into what we needed to produce in the first half of next year, what the inventory levels were going to be. And we looked at a variety of different scenarios: growth scenarios, flat scenarios and declining scenarios. And we utilized all those scenarios to help, what we feel is the best decision we can make related to production at this stage. The chart is a depiction at a high level of what we believe the gross margin rates will be when you blend all those different centers together and you look at all the possible outcomes. Could there be a scenario where we have a deeper decline in revenue and we have to pullback production even further? Yes, that could play out over 2023, but we'll see how that -- we'll see how things evolve as we get deeper into the end of this year into early next year. The focus for us, though, continues to be, as I mentioned at the start of this commentary, our top priority is cash flow. We believe there's $1.5 billion of inventory that still needs to be liquidated. You could look at history and even say that number might be as high as $2 billion. So it's somewhere in that range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We are going to aggressively pursue that. There will be some pain to our margins in the short term as we go through this transition, and the pain might be even a little more challenging if we see further top line deterioration in 2023. That being said, it is the absolute right thing to do, and I think we all agree with that. The second thing is we need to really aggressively pursue and we have been pursuing what's happening with commodity deflation and freight deflation. We see that as a big opportunity to potentially offset maybe some of these pressures we might see in a declining revenue environment in that particular situation. But either way, we need to pursue those as opportunities because they are becoming significant. You have declines since April in commodity prices at 30%, 40%, even 50% in some cases. And there's an opportunity that we have been actively pursuing for the last several months that we will continue to pursue. And yes, it will not hit our P&L until the later stages of 2023 post the liquidation of a large chunk of this inventory, but we have to make that come to life. That's another -- that's a lever that can help us maybe offset some of the pressure we might see at the top line if that does play out. And the third thing I'd say is we have a robust supply chain transformation plan, that will create $1.5 billion of value, as we both mentioned in our opening commentary over the next three years. That is significant. We see opportunities within product platforming, strategic sourcing, facility consolidation and then operational excellence that are significant that add up to that opportunity. And we will begin to achieve some of those benefits in 2023 and then further enhance those and benefits in 2024. All those levers are there and available for us to pursue to ensure that we have healthy cash flow in 2023 and we continue to make progress in the back half of the year in improving our gross margin rate.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tom Wojs: Maybe if you could just talk a little bit, Don, about some of the improvements in some of the market-facing metrics that you kind of talked about on the call in terms of where are fill rates today versus where they might have been kind of early part of this year and what the progress on that looks like. And then just as you're talking with your customers, how are they kind of thinking about promotional activity and pricing as you move into '23?
Don Allan: Yes. Thanks, Tim, for that question. Yes, I'm really pleased with the team's progress in fill rates over the last 90 days. It's not 95% or above, so we still have more opportunity in front of us. But depending on the product category, we've made anywhere from 300 basis point improvement to 600 basis point improvement in the last 90 days. And so that's a great accomplishment by the team in a very short period of time. Now a large part of it is triggered by the supply constraint that we were dealing with in semiconductors, that now is pretty much behind us at this stage. And therefore, we feel like we can really focus on making sure that we're meeting the demand that our customers have. Another metric that we've looked at is what is the on-shelf percentage of all our products within our major customers. And those numbers are actually very good, 95-plus percent when you look at our products on the shelves -- those products are on the shelf. We have very little out-of-stock situations at this point in time. The third thing that I looked at is we actually did a really sizable promotion set of shipments to many customers in September and here in the month of October. A substantial amount of promotional activity is something that we haven't seen in well over a year, and so we're very pleased to be able to get back kind of at the end cap, get into some of the off-shelf areas within our major customers and begin to really drive some of that promotional activity and share gain in those particular circumstances. So, all three of those things are what we're looking at to really say, hey, we're making progress and we're getting back to a nice mix of core business and promotional activity, which is really, what makes the Tools and the Outdoor business successful over the midterm and the long term. As far as 2023, at this point, our customers are very excited about the upcoming year and the opportunities they see. They still believe that professional will continue to be strong. As I mentioned earlier, we are preparing a variety of different scenarios that could be a healthy environment or could be a significant decline that we have to manage through. And so therefore, we think given the amount of inventory we have, we have the ability to meet the needs of the customers, both core and promotional activities. And hence, why we continue to cut back production to ensure that we do actually lower our levels of inventory over the next 12 months.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: So Don, a question on inventory, you might be shocked by that. So obviously, no surprise, I'm just wondering if maybe you could quantify the actual -- you've called out the $0.82 of incremental production penalty to the guide, but where does that stand for the full year? I mean, how much are you absorbing maybe on an annualized basis so we can try and gauge the opportunity when inventory does eventually normalize? And then secondly, just kind of second part of that question is you talked about promotional activity, which obviously is top part of the business, but do you have to promote and discount to shift that inventory over the next couple of quarters?
Don Allan: Yes. Thanks, Nigel. Yes, I would say that we've seen obviously a pretty significant impact on our margins [Technical Difficulty] year due to basically heavy pullback in production. And we've done it probably almost -- we had to make three to four different adjustments as the year has gone on. As we got into late May and June, we had to make an adjustment based on what we're seeing with the slower consumer demand. We did it again in the early July time frame to prepare for our back half. And then we did -- we're doing it again here in the late stages of the third quarter into the fourth quarter for the early part of next year. So the impact to the P&L is probably around $400 million. It's a pretty substantial number for us in 2022. So that would equate to well over $2 of EPS, probably higher than that given our tax rate is very low. So, it's substantial. And so that, in my view, obviously, is a temporary situation that we have to navigate through and really figure out what that impact would be as things start to come back in a positive way. What was the second question, Nigel, I forgot?
Nigel Coe: Discounting.
Don Allan: Discounting, yes, on the inventory. So right now, I think we're being very balanced in our approach on how we liquidate inventory. We're looking at promotional activities. We're looking at alternative channels. The interesting part of the situation is that this is not old inventory. This is inventory that's been created in the last 15 to 18 months, that is very healthy inventory that we should be able to sell at reasonable price points. The question is time, how long do we want to take for the liquidation to occur. So I think we're going to strike the right balance between pursuing promotional discount activities and really just pursuing it more through normal core activity at normal price points.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Nicole DeBlase: Just maybe we could talk a little bit about pricing. I think that's also an important variable as we all kind of think through the puts and takes for 2023. So with demand now moving into negative territory and now that we're seeing some refreshing declines in commodity prices. What's the conviction that you guys can stick the price increases that you've taken so far? And maybe what is your view of what's going on from a competitive perspective as well?
Don Allan: Yes. I think when I look -- when I think about this situation, it obviously is something that's very unusual. We can't go back in time and look at anything in Stanley Black & Decker and say we had a period of time where we had 10% to 12% price increases. That just hasn't been part of any history here within the Company, at least recent history. And so therefore, you have to look at it a little bit differently. That being said, we all have to remember there's been a period of time leading up to this where we had no price increase of any substance, and we were incurring substantial impact in our P&L from the inflation back in 2021. And so we can't forget that. We have to recognize that that's a dynamic that we went through. And then when the tail end of this happens and we're recovering the commodity deflation that we're now experiencing, which actually won't hit our P&L until the later stages of 2023, we have to be vigilant with the price increases and recognize that just because the commodity indices have changed, it does not mean we can lower our prices, because we have the high-cost inventory in our system that has to flow through and be sold to our customers and eventually the end users over some period of time, which is probably at least nine to 12 months at a minimum. And therefore, I think the tail, we will continue to be disciplined about this. We always are looking at what's happening with our competitors in the market. At this stage, we feel like our price points are very consistent with their price points across virtually every category. So, we don't see anything unusual happening there. And we do know there are some competitors that are still putting some price increases into the market even today. So there's going to be a tail here that we're going to have to navigate through. I believe the impact of deflation and what happens with price over the next two years will still be a substantial positive for Stanley Black & Decker's P&L.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is open.
Chris Snyder: So I just wanted to ask more about the decision to have higher production curtailments versus what the Company expected three months ago. Because back half demand is trending as expected versus the July update, so does this reflect a softer outlook on demand into 2023? Or just more urgency around bringing working capital down and generating cash, maybe after that working capital winds down that the Company expected in the September quarter?
Don Allan: Thank you. Maybe, Corbin, you can provide that -- give some color to that question.
Dennis Lange: No, I don't think that our view in North America is pretty consistent as we -- we're seeing levels of demand that were consistent with how we exited the second quarter. Obviously, we're seeing weaker demand in Europe. But the production curtailments are really, to your point, about generating cash and that's really what's been driving it. So, that as Don said, we've been through three or four of these. And as we look at the desire to get the inventory out, there are a few ways to do it. But the quickest way for us was to reduce our production, which we've done throughout the last three or four months.
Don Allan: Yes. I think I'll just add to that, that when I made some comments in response to the first question, we have looked at a variety of different scenarios. And one of the scenarios is a continued retraction of demand as the housing market continues to slow and potentially construction slows down for a period of time. And therefore, we're factoring that into our decision as well. So it's a combination of what Corbin said, but it's also looking at what we think are potential scenarios for next year, and being thoughtful about what our production should be today. We have to remember that our supply chain is fairly lengthy. So things that we're producing today, we're selling -- something we produce this month, we're probably selling in the month of March and April of next year. And so that's really the decision we're making. And we're trying to strike the right balance and reducing the inventory, as Corbin was describing, and being as proactive and aggressive about that to continue to drive a healthy cash flow performance going forward. And then two, making sure we meet the needs of our customers and not have a retraction in our fill rates. And I think based on the decision we've made around production, we are striking the proper balance in that particular area.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Just wanted to try and get a sense, obviously, a lot of near-term disruption. And just trying to -- I guess, in two ways, number one, kind of zero in on the next couple of quarters, I guess, 4Q, for example, is going to be low digit margins in Tools & Storage. How much of that margin level is what you'd consider to be relatively temporary primarily, I think, driven by the inventory reductions? And how much is kind of a reset versus expectations 90 days ago? And I guess, ultimately, where I'm going with this is, I think in your most -- in Slide 9, you're talking about a high 20s gross margin by the end of the year. Potentially, it could -- the opportunity for low 30s, but it does look like that's a little bit of a reset versus also 90 days ago. And what type of headwinds are you seeing today compared to getting to, I believe, you kind of threw out like that $7 per share run rate by the end of 2023? It looks like there's a few more moving pieces or headwinds that might take that number down by $1 or $2 even.
Don Allan: Well, so I'll -- there was a lot in that, Michael. So I'll start with the first question you had around fourth quarter margins and how much they may be being impacted by these pullback in production decisions. The impact in the fourth quarter is about 5 points or 500 basis points. So it's substantial, clearly. So we're also dealing with the last stages or the middle stages of the high-cost inventory from the big inflation wage that we've had that are in our inventory now, and that we're starting to sell that through. So that's another factor that's pushing down margins that will take time to work through. Because even when you get 90% or 100% price recovery when you go to these actions, you still have an impact in your margin rate that's substantial. And in this case, the differential in our margin rate is about 300 basis points just from the difference of inflation, dollar and price dollar, because it's not a one-for-one offset. The only way you're going to offset it completely in your margin rate is going to be if you get like 120%, 130% recovery on inflation through price. And so you got a bit of a double impact that's impacting the margins right now in Q4. And so I think that's something that we just have to be thoughtful about as we analyze the view of Q4. We're not going to give a ton of color on 2023. What we're trying to do is help people understand that there's a path to get our gross margins back to the high 20s and eventually to 35-plus percent. The path is really about eliminating some of these temporary things, because these things are temporary in the sense of pulling back on production will eventually get back to a more normal level of production because we're going through a period of time that's whatever this recession is going to be and how long it's going to last. But if you just kind of put that in the rearview mirror and focus post the recession, we are going to be back to normal levels of production. We're going to have transformed our supply chain. We will have pursued all the commodity deflation that's out there. And yes, could there be a partial price offset to that? Yes, there could be. But at the end of the day, all these different things are going to have -- these are levers that drive our margin back to those levels. As far as what we guided back in July, what we're doing now has nothing to do with guidance in July. We have a new view on 2023, and so we're adjusting our manufacturing on that. I talked about the different scenarios we looked at as a result of that. We're getting closer to 2023, so it gives us the opportunity to adjust our manufacturing at this point. And then, we also want to be more aggressive and focus on generating more cash flow and reduce our inventory in the short and midterm. And that's really what's driving the temporary impact to our gross margins. I understand nobody likes the gross margins where they are. I don't like them where they are either. But I feel like we're pulling all the right levers that are in our control that are going to get our gross margins back to where they need to be. But it's going to be a multiyear period of time for that to happen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Adam Baumgarten: I'm just wondering if you could run through some of the point-of-sale trends that you saw in U.S. retail throughout the quarter and maybe into October, if you saw any deceleration. It sounded like it was relatively stable, but any nuance would be helpful as we enter the fourth quarter.
Don Allan: Sure. Do you want to take that, Corbin?
Dennis Lange: Yes. As we said earlier, we really did not see a big difference in the third quarter from what we exited in the second quarter. So in some ways, particularly around power tools, they've held up pretty well. Hand tools obviously was down a little bit. But in general, I think the POS sales in the U. S. have held up somewhat surprisingly well third quarter. Hard to tell what's going to happen in the fourth quarter and next year, as Don mentioned. But in the third quarter, we were relatively -- on a relative basis, pleased with what we saw.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David MacGregor: Yes, I think we got a pretty good handle on inventory and gross margins at this point. Let me just ask about the outdoor acquisitions and you talked about slower consumer demand and the seasonal patterns, which I guess we understand is probably comes as a surprise to anyone. The seasonal pattern, was it consistent or was there something changing there? And just talk about margin contribution expectations and the progress on integration. And how do you avoid not being distracted by everything you're focusing on with inventory and gross margins and keep an appropriate level of focus on the integration and the achievement of value for the steel?
Don Allan: That's a great question. We've actually integrated or folded in the integration process of MTD and Excel into the transformation plan in all the rhythms and rigors that we have around that. I mean we spend a lot of time every day, every week, focusing on these different things that we're talking about over the last hour. And so we have created a set of processes and rhythms that allow us to really polish these different things, make decisions related to a variety of different items and folding in the integration of MTD and Excel into that has actually been a bit of an efficiency for us to make sure that we don't lose sight of the importance of those acquisitions and effectively integrating them into the Stanley Black & Decker operating system. I think -- when I think about the outdoor business, yes, it was a rough outdoor season this year for sure due to weather primarily. And then, there was a bit of a consumer impact at the tail end of it as well as consumers started shifting their dollars to other areas. That being said, as you talk to our customers, they -- as usual, they're very bullish about the upcoming outdoor season and early next year. I think it will be a good season if the weather cooperates. Again, I think we've planned for a variety of different scenarios that could play out, whether it's a flat scenario or an up scenario or a down scenario, will be determined. But our production levels have been focused on those different scenarios because we are producing product in the fourth quarter for the upcoming season. So, it's difficult to know where that season is going to go. But if you listen to our customers, they're very excited about it. We're taking a balanced point of view on it to make sure that we effectively meet the needs of our customers and ensure that we don't get stuck with a lot of extra inventory if something unusual plays out. Maybe Corbin, you might want to talk a little bit about where we are with margin profile, how the integration is going and provide a little more color on that.
Corbin Walburger: Yes. The integration, I think, has gone very well. And the colleagues that joined from MTD and Excel have been fantastic, and it's great to have them as target team, and the very innovative right now. Given the seasonal weakness that we saw in the spring and summer, obviously, margin rates were hit probably more than we expected because of the weaker season. However, as we go forward, we don't -- our view hasn't changed in where we think the business can get to over time. And we're generally very strong on hitting our synergy targets and getting the margins of our acquisitions to where we want, and we feel the same for both MTD and Excel on this one.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2022 Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2022 second quarter webcast. On the webcast, in addition to myself, is Don Allan, President and CEO; and Corbin Walburger, Vice Presidentand Interim CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. This morning, Don and Corbin will review our 2022 second quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we will be just sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any Forward-Looking Statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Dennis and good morning, everyone. As you saw from this morning's results, we continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment including inflation, rising interest rates and now late in the quarter, we started to see these factors impact retail, customer demand across our global Tools & Outdoor markets. The significantly slower demand trends in June combined with a very late start to the Outdoor season due to weather resulted in significant volume pressure versus expectations and revenue, we landed well below our plans. In response to the sudden shift in demand, we have taken immediate corrective cost actions, which are already in progress. We are now expecting demand to normalize closer to 2019 levels for the remainder of 2022. The organization is focused on taking the necessary steps to reduce inventory, generate cash flow and re-size our cost base, through corporate simplification, organizational optimization and supply chain transformation. We will provide more detail on these areas later in our presentation, but we expect these initiatives can deliver pre-tax savings of $1 billion, as well as a significant reduction in inventory, beginning in the second half of 2022, and through the end of 2023. Over the last nine-months, we have executed a number of acquisitions and divestitures that have successfully focused our company around our market-leading Tools & Outdoor businesses, as well as our strongly positioned industrial products business. As you saw last week, our security and access technology transactions successfully closed, and we are using the $3.5 billion in gross cash proceeds net of tax to fund the $2.3 billion share repurchase, from earlier this year, as well as to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce debt levels in the third quarter. We also expect our oil and gas divestiture to close within the third quarter. These transactions enable us to intensify our focus on operational efficiency within our remaining, now simplified business portfolio. We also must continue to advance our strong innovation agenda, pursue a faster path of electrification in Outdoor and engineered fascinating, while we drive further global market penetration, along the way. We are redirecting resources within our Tools & Outdoor businesses to ensure we are extremely well-positioned for strong long-term growth, profitability expansion, consistent annual cash flow and improved shareholder returns. Incorporating the changes from this new demand environment, as well as factoring in the impact of our cost reduction plan caused us to revise our 2022 adjusted diluted EPS range down to $5 up to $6 and to update our free cash flow estimate to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the second half of 2022. This free cash flow range excludes the tax payments associated with our security divestitures. To summarize our second quarter, revenues were $4.4 billion, up 16%, driven by our Outdoor Equipment acquisition. Organic revenue was down 6%, which was impacted by slower Tools & Outdoor demand trends across many of our global markets due to poor weather start to the Outdoor season and reduce consumer spending. Price realization contributed 7%, which accelerated sequentially from the first quarter. Our total company operating margin was 9.2%, benefiting from the contribution of our pricing actions, but was down versus prior year due to lower volume, cost inflation and supply chain logistic cost increases. This resulted in second quarter adjusted EPS of a $1.77. More from Corbin on Q2 and 2022 guidance a bit later. As I previously mentioned, we saw a swift deterioration in Consumer Tools & Outdoor demand. This was in contrast to professional tool demand and the professional Outdoor independent channel, which remained healthy and continue to be active opportunities. During this timeframe, the consumer faced price increases across many categories, including essentials like food and energy. Consequently, our consumer categories have started to become impacted. We have seen this phenomena across many of our global markets, as central banks tighten the money supply to control high inflation. The chart on the left illustrates our tools U.S. POS trends against a 2019 base. Late in the quarter, it became clear that the point of sale trends were settling into a much lower growth position. And with information we have now, we believe it is prudent to build this into our plan for the back half. Price and a strong professional market delivered total dollar growth off the 2019 baseline. However, volumes turned negative versus 2019 in the later part of the quarter, or specifically in the month of June. We have analyzed the trends in the pricing in the market and do not see retail price gaps versus competition. This coupled with our information at the category and retailer level leads us to conclude that our markets are softening. Outdoor power equipment also experience slowing demand during the month of June. Customer inventory levels are elevated, largely driven by a very slow start of the season due to poor weather, which clearly is impacting replenishment demand across the retail Outdoor power equipment industry. The poor consumer Outdoor season is a well known fact in the industry initially due to poor weather start and then declining consumer spending due to inflationary pressures previously discussed. However, there are a couple significant positive factors to consider in this difficult demand environment. One, we will be past the constraints on semiconductor supply in the third quarter, and other inputs have greatly improved as well. Therefore, we are expecting better fill rates in the back half to capitalize on the continued strength we are seeing for professional end user driven demand and Tools & Outdoor. And two, the tools inventories at many of our major customers in north America are below 2019 levels, which should limit our destocking risk to customers in certain other geographies, such as Europe, and as well as the U.S. Outdoor retail category I mentioned. Across our industrial businesses, backlogs remain strong and demand for aerospace fasteners is steadily climbing, as the recovery and narrow body production has begun. The auto recovery continues to be choppy, but we do see some improvement and continue to outperform light vehicle production levels as demand of electric vehicles remains well above supply and OEMs continue to pursue strategic long-term transformation to EV centric portfolios. In summary, we see a demand environment that is modestly higher than 2019 levels and therefore, we are implementing an aggressive cost and inventory response to this new environment, while also pivoting the company to a new strategy for long-term success. We continued to have conviction in the long-term outlook of the markets we serve around construction, repair and remodel, Outdoor and across the industrial sector. With the housing inventory at historical lows and relative strength in the industrial markets we serve, our businesses are squarely positioned to satisfy our customer demands after we navigate the current environment. The portfolio transformation that we have orchestrated over the past nine-years is coming to conclusion, and we are setting up our core businesses to emerge even stronger on the other side of demand disruption. As we look ahead, Stanley Black & Decker is at an important point of inflection in our vision and strategy. We must ensure our customers and end users and their needs are where our energy and resources are fully focused. Our plan is to rapidly optimize our organizational structure to support our simplified company. We will take the complexity out of our businesses and the decision making processes. Then we will invest to accelerate growth to enable us to grow organically two to three times the market. The operating environment clearly has dramatically changed in the last month, especially, as we really evolved into the last stages of the quarter or June. Since accepting my current role, the leadership team and I have accelerated intensified the organization in operational streamlining efforts. We are rallying the teams are around a more focused portfolio and providing the businesses with the resources closer to the point of impact. Our tools Outdoor industrial businesses are high quality assets today, and we have the opportunity to improve them further through faster organic growth and significant operational enhancements to improve our margins. As we think about our leading franchises, the key areas of focus will be innovation, electrification, market leadership, and supply chain transformation. With always keeping the customer and end user needs in our sites. First, we are reimagining Tools & Outdoor innovation to create shorter innovation cycles and new technologies. So we can provide differentiated competitive offerings with speed to market. This includes introducing a high quality of new margin accretive core innovations to the portfolio in addition to more big swing innovations that carry the same disruptive power of our successful franchise extensions, such as flexible, atomic, extreme and power stack. Secondly, we are taking meaningful action to deliver innovation and electrification with power Tools & Outdoor power equipment, as well as capitalizing on our partnerships with auto OEMs to leverage our highly engineered auto fastening solutions, the electric vehicle market, as it rapidly expands. These are big opportunities for growth and margin expansion across the portfolio. We are accelerating our efforts in these areas, as these trends are moving quickly, and we must maintain our market leadership position during this technology shift. Next, we will step up our commercial support, bringing more digital tools to our commercial model and increasing sales leadership to directly engage with our customers and end users. These resources drive share gain and key information from our end users related to our products and potential new innovations. In addition, we will enhance our efforts in digital marketing around, new innovation launches, promotions and other key end user interactions. Finally, to enable this growth, we need to accelerate our supply chain transformation. One of many lessons from the pandemic is that complex and long supply chains are prone to disruption. And in our specific case are not matched well with the short cycle nature of our businesses. So you have a choice maintain very high levels of inventory due to the long supply chain or have your supply chain closer to your customer, elevate your agility, and resiliency to better serve those customers. We believe being closer to the customer is the right answer. Organizationally, we are working to ensure that I have the right people in the right roles to execute this vision. We have an accomplished leadership team supported by a diverse, extremely capable organization, which is comprised of Stanley Black and Decker veterans and supplemented by new talent, with fresh perspectives and industry expertise. We continue to bring in new members of our leadership team to partner with our existing seasoned leaders. A few examples of this are Robert Raff and John Wyatt are leading our tool and Outdoor businesses and Tamer Abuaita, sorry, Tamer who joined us at our Chief Supply Chain Officer in January. I’m excited to see Robert rejoin the tools business to lead the team with fresh energy and insight. He is a veteran tool executive who also led our security business transformation. He knows the business, the team and our customers, and we will bring that perspective as he gets the tool organization focused on our shared vision. Tamer brings nearly 30-years of experience leading global transformations, expansions and post acquisition integrations of supply chains for multi-billion dollar consumer goods organizations. He is ideally suited to lead the transformation of our supply chain. All of these growth and supply chain investments are necessary to support higher growth and share gains with our target objective being two to three times the market growth. Now let's get tactical. Let me describe our global cost reduction program, which has a savings potential of $150 million to $200 million in 2022, growing to $1 billion by the end of next year and totaling $2 billion within three-years. These actions are necessary, as we successfully navigate the current market environment. But importantly, when the time is right, it will give us the ability to further accelerate investment in the commercial programs, I just outlined. Over the past two months, we have applied rigorous prioritization to eliminate and reduce overlapping capabilities and functions. As a more straightforward company, we don't need the same structure that was set up for diversified industrial model. The corporate simplification is nearing completion and it will generate $200 million of annualized savings. The resizing effort allows us to ensure our resources serve our core businesses and are closer to the point of impact with the customer and in our supply chain. As a result of these initiatives, we expect the 2023 corporate spending level will be below the 2019 spend. To help us to navigate today's economic cross currents, and in spirit of simplification, we are also attacking indirect spend. We are prioritizing across all categories and cost centers to re-qualify what we will continue in the near-term. We expect this exercise to generate an additional $200 million of annualized savings. Next, we have an opportunity to improve the speed and agility of our operating and decision making processes. We are doing this by reducing the complexity of how we are operating as an organization, including evaluating the number of layers in our structure from the C-suite to the point of impact. To put this in perspective, we believe, we can move from our current organizational structure which has 12 layers, down closer to seven to eight layers. I believe that, we function much better as a company when our leaders can come together quickly for prioritization and decision making and results in results in us moving forward in a more agile manner. Additionally, as we have gone deeper into our Outdoor integration, we see opportunities for savings, where there are synergies with our tools business. We are implementing the spans and layers and cost synergy exercises during Q3 and expect this effort to deliver an additional $100 million in annual savings. Lastly, we are accelerating our supply chain transformation. We believe there is approximately $1.5 billion of P&L efficiencies that can be gained by this acceleration over the next three years with $500 million by the end of 2023. I will go into more detail in this value stream in just a moment. So to summarize, we believe this program can deliver cost savings of $150 million to $200 million in 2022, $1 billion by the end of 2023 and $2 billion within three years. I will now dive a little bit deeper into the supply chain transformation, which is the largest driver of this global cost plan particularly in the medium-term. As mentioned, we are embarking on a three year journey that will completely reshape our supply chain. It will be focused on accelerating our Make Where We Sell strategy to be closer to our customers and more responsive to demand. Our supply chain needs to be agile and adaptive with new product innovation and therefore, as we ramp up our investments in innovation and expand the quantity of our new products we bring to market annually, we also need a supply chain that significantly reduces our innovation cycle time to launch new products much faster than today. This transformation is a key pillar of our strategy and a catalyst for returning our gross margins to 35% plus level. Our success with this transformation will build a more sustainable, agile and efficient supply chain that is resilient in an ever-changing and dynamic operating environment and further enable our advanced manufacturing technologies. We will be focused around four value streams. First product platforming shifts our optimization focus from cost to supply by leveraging product families designed around common building blocks. This shift enables us to standardize our components through platform solutions that create economies of scale with our key suppliers, which ultimately reduces the complexity in our product design and supply base. It also reduces time to market on innovation by leveraging common design. We also believe we can reduce the number of SKUs in our system by 40% plus. These programs collectively can deliver cost savings of approximately $300 million. The next significant opportunity is strategic sourcing, which has a savings potential of $500 million. As we look to set up our supply base through our Make Where We Sell strategy, we have an opportunity to deepen our relationships with suppliers and help them optimize supply and efficiency. In addition, we have significant opportunities to leverage contract manufacturing in, in parts of our supply chain that can improve cost and speed to market. Finally, our simplification efforts within our first value stream, product platforming also carries benefits here as we have less unique parts in sourcing complexity, which results in higher scale purchases. Our current supply chain is a result of organic growth in additions through acquisitions. And while it has been optimized over the years, there is significant opportunity to reduce complexity, eliminate logistical inefficiencies, increase scale for our manufacturing and serve our customers better. Currently, we have approximately 120 manufacturing facilities in our network. As we think about our supply chain of the future, we want to be closer to our customer and we want to do it at a lower cost. This means we need to simplify and consolidate our regional footprints around high performing industry core, technology enabled sites. Our target is to reduce our operating footprint by at least 30% and optimize our distribution network, which can generate approximately $300 million in savings. Lastly, we see an opportunity to capture $400 million through operational excellence. This is focused on driving incremental efficiencies across our facilities, leveraging the SPD operating model, having the right levels of inventory and streamlining the spans and layers within our operations organization to align around our core businesses. These value streams total approximately $1.5 billion of over three years with an opportunity for $500 million during the first 18-months of the program. Clearly, this represents a significant value creation opportunity. However, it also creates an opportunity to elevate the focus on our customers and end user needs. Corbin will now take you through more detailed commentary on the second quarter results, as well as what we believe this near-term demand environment means for the remainder of the year. Corbin.
Corbin Walburger: Thank you, Don and good morning, everyone. Let me walk through the details of our second quarter business results. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor revenue grew 17% as the MTD and Excel acquisitions contributed $900 million of revenue and price realization contributed 7% accelerating approximately 1.5 point sequentially as a result of our third round of global price increases implemented in May. These factors were partially offset by a 16% decline in volume and a negative 2% impact from currency, which both softened as we move through the quarter as interest rates increased and inflation in non-discretionary categories like gas and fuel hit consumers’ wallets. As a result, U.S. retail point of sale demand softened during May and June. That said, our professional customer channels and products remain solid and outperformed our consumer-oriented offerings. On an organic basis, regional performances were flat in the emerging markets down 10% in Europe, and down 11% in North America. Operating margin for the segment was 10.8%. Excluding acquisitions margin was a point better at 11.8%. However, still below the 19.9% level from the same period last year, as the benefit from our price actions was more than offset by inflation, higher supply chain costs and lower volume. Across channels sales were down versus 2021 levels. However, against a pre pandemic 2019 baseline retail was up mid-single digits and commercial and industrial was upload double digits. Turning to the Tools & Outdoor SBUs, power tools and hand tools declined organically by 6% and 8% respectively, driven by the softening of retail demand and against a very strong period in the prior year. Operationally, the teams have been successful and alleviating our semiconductor supply constraints and are beginning to see semiconductor driven fill rate improvements for the previously constrained products. The fill rates are on a path to return to targeted levels in the third quarter. As we look forward, our investments in innovation, electrification and commercial resources will support the launch of new product introductions expected in the back half, and into 2023. We are launching a series of new DEWALT cordless solutions continuing to electrify the professional job site. As we convert current product categories, still relying largely on corded and gas powered products to next generation battery powered tools, we will also pair these new products with the DEWALT power stack, our industry leading battery technology that launched only seven-months ago. Coming later this year is a world's first innovation, the new DEWALT impact connect, which consists of new accessories that attach to an impact driver and will allow end users to effortlessly cut copper and PVC pipe up to four times faster than standard hand tools. We will also launch new category solutions for the trade users with our CRAFTSMAN and STANLEY brands, expanding these 20-volt systems to more than a 100 products by early 2023. As we have throughout our history, we remain committed to serving the ongoing performance needs of the most demanding pro and trade users of the DEWALT, STANLEY and CRAFTSMAN solutions. The Outdoor business declined 8% on a pro forma organic basis. This decline was driven by a very slow start to the season due to poor weather, as well as softening consumer demand, similar to many other discretionary retail categories. Due to the softer demand, our retailers are working down inventory and have eased replenishment at this point. Despite this, season being slower than 2021, pro forma sales are still favorable as compared to 2019 levels, primarily driven by the secular gains we have experienced from electrification, which remains our focus going forward. The Outdoor team continues to advance our platform integration efforts, and we are excited about the innovation, growth and synergy opportunities ahead. Stay tuned for the exciting launch of a host of new Outdoor offerings, including innovations in handheld, walk behind and ride-on equipment for the 2023 season. Now shifting to industrial. Segment revenue increased 8% versus last year, as eight points of price realization coupled with four points of volume were partially offset by about a four point negative impact from currency. Operating margin was 9.3%, which compares to 10.5% in the second quarter of last year, as the benefit of price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation. Looking within the segment, engineered fastening organic revenues were up 7%, as 7% general industrial fastener growth was accompanied by 4% growth in the auto fastener business, along with an acceleration for aerospace fasteners, which was up 36%. The auto fastener business continues to successfully operate in a dynamic environment and outpace light vehicle production by five points. Our industrial fastener business has a healthy backlog, which is up 18% versus last year. Aerospace fasteners delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement. This business is focused on capturing the recovery in OEM production, which is underway. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 26%, driven by 17% growth in attachment tools. Infrastructure backlog remains strong, up 44% versus last year, and the team continues to partner with suppliers to successfully fill booked orders. Moving on to our aggressive plan to reduce inventory to generate strong cash flow in the second half. Our second quarter ending inventory balance was $6.6 billion, up approximately $400 million versus the first quarter and up versus historical levels of stock. The main factors contributing to the increase versus prior years were; An elevated level of in process inventory as a result of the congested global supply chain, along with higher inflation, finished goods above current demand requirements and approximately $1 billion of additional inventory from the Outdoor acquisitions. We are implementing actions to significantly reduce working capital by $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the second half of 2022, primarily from inventory reductions. There are five parallel work streams already underway to enact as sequential inventory decline with a sense of urgency. First, production curtailments to slow finish goods manufacturing have already started. Second, commercial teams are working on expediting sell through of on-hand finished goods. Third, safety stock levels are being reviewed and optimized. Fourth, goods and transit are being actively addressed as we work to reduce lead times and slow production. And lastly, levels of raw material and whip are being evaluated to meet current production requirements. This inventory reduction plan has P&L cost implications for the next few quarters, but is necessary to realign our inventory to the current demand environment and meet our cash generation requirements. Let's transition to the next slide, where I will speak further about gross margin. Total company adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was approximately 28% down two points from the prior two quarters and against the 36% we had in the prior year. The confluence of the elongated supply chain, inflation and easing consumer demand impacted growth margins, partially offset by the implementation of price increases. Over the last 12-months, we have been responding to inflation with multiple rounds of price increases, which is reflected in our price performance over the last few quarters. At this stage, given the slowing demand environment and moderating spot commodity rates, we are targeting surgical opportunities for price as opposed to additional broad based global price increases. The cumulative impacts of rising inflation and global supply chain costs and inefficiencies are now capitalized in inventory. While we believe we can optimize moving forward, these capitalized costs will be with us until our inventory returns to normalized levels. In addition, there will be costs associated with plants running at curtail levels while we destock. We expect the cost dynamic of this inventory normalization process to take three to four quarters with gross margins sequentially improving as we move into and through the first half of 2023. These are short-term, but necessary impacts as we prioritize cash flow in this environment. To quantify this opportunity, we see 300 basis points of improvement potential. Once the destocking is complete. We are clearly not satisfied with 30% gross margins and have begun implementing the following actions to accelerate the pace and increase the magnitude of this improvement. First, we are immediately attacking the fixed and semi-fixed costs across our manufacturing base, capturing the quick wins from the first phase of our supply chain transformation. Second, spot commodity prices have moderated from the peak levels in April. While this will take until 2023 to work its way into the P&L, we plan to aggressively go after savings to capture this opportunity. In total, these two actions can accelerate the pace of margin improvement and enable us to achieve low 30s gross margins in the back half of next year. Our three-year target is to get our gross margins back to 35% plus and the $1.5 billion supply chain transformation that Don discussed is how we do it. So to summarize, prioritizing cash generation is the right decision for the company by curtailing our production plans and lowering our inventories to set ourselves up for a stronger 2023 and beyond. Now let me pull all this together into what it means for 2022 guidance. We are expecting total revenue growth to be in the low double-digits. We are updating our adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5 to $6. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $0.80 to $2.05, inclusive of onetime charges related to restructuring expenses, a voluntary retirement program, the Russian business closure and integration-related costs. The current estimate for pretax charges in 2022 is approximately $760 million to $810 million. The change in pretax charges from April guidance primarily relate to a roughly $170 million non-cash asset impairment charge related to the oil and gas divestiture and an estimate of $150 million to $200 million in restructuring to support our cost reduction plans. On the right side of the slide, we have outlined the components of our adjusted EPS assumptions versus our prior estimate. The slowing consumer demand in Tools & Outdoor, along with moderated price expectations, contributes to lower revenues and reduces EPS by $4.25. Currency translation, below-the-line items and second quarter performance impact EPS by another $0.55. We expect the plant production curtailments to range from $0.50 to $0.70 of a reduction as we minimize fixed and semi-fixed cost during this period, but do not completely avoid them. Then the 2022 benefit from the cost savings initiatives that we previously described adds $0.80 to $1. I want to spend a moment to recap the drivers of our cost savings plan. simplifying the corporate structure, reducing indirect spend, optimizing organizational spans and layers and streamlining the operational footprint are expected to total $100 million to $200 million in savings over the remainder of 2022 with cumulative savings of $1 billion by the end of 2023. We have also disclosed other below-the-line planning items for modeling purposes on the slide. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to decline mid- to high single digits with margins down on a year-over-year basis. Pricing is expected to contribute high single-digit growth for the back half and full-year. We believe there is a meaningful midterm opportunity to improve margins within the Outdoor acquisitions over the coming years, and this continues to be a significant priority for us. We expect high single-digit margins this year, and we see the potential for low double-digit margins over the coming years. We are targeting the Industrial segment to achieve high single-digit to low double-digit organic growth, driven by innovation, pricing and cyclical recoveries across much of the portfolio. The industrial margin rate is expected to be pressured year-over-year largely due to inflation and mix. We are closely following the recoveries in auto and aerospace and still believe there to be a solid growth outlook in those markets. Shifting more specifically to the third quarter, we expect adjusted EPS will approximate 13% of the full-year. This is comprised of relatively flat sequential tool sales, a slight sequential improvement for Industrial and a seasonally lighter Outdoor quarter as compared to the first half of the year. Now turning to cash flow. Second half free cash flow, excluding the tax payments from the security sale is expected to approximate $1 billion to $1.5 billion, supported by our inventory and cost optimization actions. The divestiture-related tax payment is expected to approximate $500 million to $600 million, and therefore, total free cash flow is expected to be $400 million to $1 billion in the second half. Stanley Black & Decker remains focused on disciplined capital allocation and our current priority for excess capital deployment will be debt repayment to support our strong investment-grade credit ratings and our commitment to the continued return of value to our shareholders as reflected by the recently announced 55th consecutive annual dividend increase. After we strengthen the balance sheet and the macro improves, our plan for excess capital is to prioritize our share repurchase program. And I'm sure many of you are thinking about what the normalized earnings power is for the company. It will take until the first half of next year to work through our inventory destocking plans and fully implement and realize the benefits from our cost reduction actions. We believe the initiatives we have outlined today are sufficient to return to our 2019 earnings power on an annualized basis once we hit the second half of next year. This does not assume any improvements to revenue. Here is how you get there. We believe destocking is a three to four quarter process that will improve our gross margins by approximately three points as we move into and through the front half of next year. Then the annualized benefit of our prioritization, complexity reduction efforts and impact from our indirect spend reductions are worth approximately $500 million by the end of 2023. Finally, the supply chain transformation can add another two to three points to gross margins as those savings are realized. These are all items within our control, and if we were to achieve them at a faster pace or realize improvements from revenue or input pricing, we will be prepared to accelerate investment in our core businesses and capitalize on the growth or realize improvements from revenue or input pricing, we will be prepared to accelerate investment in our core businesses and capitalize on the growth opportunities that Don outlined. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Don to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Don.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Corbin. There is no doubt challenging environments in recent history, which underscores the need to accelerate our strategic transformation that will carry the benefits of increasing agility and improving our responsiveness to customer demand. Our portfolio transformation comes at an ideal time as it enables us to unlock significant value by rapidly pivoting the organizational structure and operating plan towards a more focused company, centered around great franchises within our Tools & Outdoor and industrial businesses. We have an aggressive cost program that we expect will yield $1 billion of savings by the end of next year and approaching a cumulative savings of $2 billion within three years. This will allow us to accelerate investments in our core businesses as the demand environment clears. As we look forward, we have a clear vision, and we believe these actions will reshape our organization and elevate our focus on our customer and end user needs, enabling us to deliver strong shareholder value through long-term growth and enhanced profitability. With that, we are now ready for Q&A, Dennis.
Dennis Lange: Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.
Q - Jeffrey Sprague: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning. I guess my 1 question would be picking up with more kind of Corbin close back to the kind of earnings power question over time. I just want to clarify really how you are defining earnings power relative to 2019. Obviously, we have got Outdoor in. We have got security out. We have got a different share base. Are you suggesting that kind of earnings power is shown by EPS or some other metric is in line with 2019. So maybe just give us a little more color on that and how you see that trajectory to play out through the quarters of 2023.
Donald Allan: Yes. I will start and then pass it over to Corbin with a little more detail. But obviously, we have utilized 2019 as a base to compare things to because it was pre-pandemic. And so before all the unusual activities of 2020 and 2021 of a recession in early '20 and then a boom for three or four quarters and now things are starting to shift with potentially a significant recession on the horizon. We believe that we are kind of normalizing back to 2019 levels as a result of what we are seeing right now. The earnings are not at that point yet, as you can see from the back half guidance we are providing. But if you start to think through the cost actions we are taking, some of the temporary pressures that we are going to experience in the back half, as Corbin described around inventory liquidation, you start to build a pass that gets you closer and closer to what the 2019 EPS was which was about $7.25 roughly. Yes, very different comparable as far as Outdoor versus security. But it does give you kind of a guideline of what we are thinking about internally for kind of our initial objectives of where we want to take earnings. And then obviously, with a $2 billion plan over a three year period. If we have a stable environment from a revenue perspective over that three year period or a growth environment over that three year period, which I would expect would occur. You can see a path where earnings really start to improve in a more dramatic way as we get through 2023 and then into 2024. Corbin, Any more color or details you like to get on that?
Corbin Walburger: The only thing I would add is if you think about the second half of 2022 and then you annualize that, that gets you a little over $3 and then if you take the $1 billion of incremental cost in 2023, that gets you a little over $4. And so you get - it is another way to get back to what we did in 2019 at $3 plus $4, a little over $7 a share.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Bosch with Baird. Your line is now open.
Timothy Wojs: Yes. Hey guys good morning. I kind of have a two-parter, but I guess what gives you the confidence that this is really, I guess, a market phenomenon versus something that is more kind of Stanley specific? And as you are thinking about these cost reductions, can you just talk through how you are kind of protecting brand and R&D investments just to make sure there is no long-lasting impact on some of the brand values.
Donald Allan: Yes. Thanks, Tim, for the question. When I think about what is happening right now, I mean, there is a lot of information that we have, data we have around POS that is impacting clearly, our business and our products. We also have conversations with many of our customers that we serve. We also have seen some recent earnings releases from other companies that are in spaces where we are as well as - or close to that type of category in the building product space. So I feel like when you triangulate all that information, it definitively says there is a slowing demand environment happening that is occurring. And so we also are looking at it, we have looked at all our pricing, as I mentioned, versus our competitors. And our price points are pretty much at par with all our competitor products in all the major key categories. So we don't see any big gaps where we have premiums that are significant versus our competition. Based on all that factor, it doesn't feel like there is anything unique that is happening related to Stanley Black & Decker that this is truly more of a market phenomenon that that is playing out, which makes sense because a lot of the products that we are providing. There is some discretion associated with those products and certain buying decisions versus some of the other building products that are necessary to build a home, whether that is lumber or whether that is insulation, windows, doors, there is still a fair amount of backlog that exists in the pro market. And although we are starting to see signs that maybe that backlog is dwindling a little bit. And the orders going in there are not as strong as they have been in the last year. However, there is a fair amount of backlog to continue probably a strong pro performance for another six to nine-months. But when you get to the discretionary decisions on tools, and some of the other categories that I mentioned, you can start to see where we begin to begin the tip of a spear of a downturn, and that is really what I believe we are seeing right now. On the cost side, thank you for asking that question, we have been very thoughtful about how we are going to do this. So the $2 billion, $1.5 billion will be very focused on supply chain transformation. I went through all the details of that. That is not touching brand that is not touching engineers. That is not touching the sales organization. So that leaves you with the $500 million of SG&A, $200 million of that is the corporate simplification, where we are really just taking out a lot of the complexity of our corporate organization. We are no longer a diversified industrial company. We are primarily a Tools & Outdoor company, with an excellent industrial business alongside of it as well. It makes us a very simpler company than we can be more streamlined, more efficient and effective and then we have a significant indirect spend component, which is not people related. And then there is the, what I would call, the optimization of spans and layers, which is about $100 million. And that is really looking at that structure of how our businesses are organized and how many layers do we need, what is the span of control and really trying to optimize that. And that really, for the most part, will avoid the R&D organization, the sales organization, our digital marketing organization and really be more focused on the leadership team and the management of the businesses and also simplifying the processes that they utilize to make decisions throughout the day and the week as they drive the business. I feel pretty confident that we are very much focused on making sure we do not impact the organization that you mentioned.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks good morning everyone. If you go back to 2023, obviously, 2023 seems like a long way. But just going back to the comments, Corbin, you made about sort of getting back to a normalized earnings kind of number. And I think you said $6 to $7 when you layer in the cost savings and initiatives and things like that. Number one, is that the right way to read that? And then just around that sort of mathematics, are we seeing any benefit whatsoever from raw material deflation coming through. Obviously, your kind of input costs you laid out in April are well off those levels back in April. But is that part of your supply chain savings? And I'm assuming that the 2023 buyback is off the table at this point, just if you can hit as well.
Donald Allan: Yes. I would say that when we go through those questions there, why don't we start with the buyback, we will get to the buyback as soon as we can. But as Corbin said, we are focused on inventory reduction, getting our cash flow performance to higher levels, fairly significant performance in the back half of this year as we both described. Another strong performance next year will be expected for cash flow and we will be focused on that. We will also be focused on getting our debt levels down to where we want them to be, where we have had them historically related to debt-to-EBITDA ratios. When we feel like we are in a good position to do that, we will do the buyback. That could be in 2023 or it could be a little bit later. Time will tell. We will see how things play out. Corbin, maybe you can take the question on the $6 to $7 and 2023 and provide a little more granularity and clarification of that.
Corbin Walburger: Yes, you bet, Nigel. The way that I was thinking about it was if you take the run rate for the second half of which is about $1.50, and you analyze that, that becomes about $3 on an annual basis of an EPS base. And then if you add the $4 which is the $800 million of additional cost savings we plan to get in 2023, that is $4. So the $3 plus $4 gets you to $7, which is close to what the 2019 base is. Just another way to think about 2019 being a baseline for earnings going forward.
Donald Allan: Yes. And so the other part of Nigel's question was about commodity trends. So yes, we had a high in the March, April time frame. We have seen commodities pull back significantly, except for lithium. Lithium is still holding in pretty strong because there is still a high demand for batteries across many industries. But a lot of those spot prices have dropped back to levels that are closer to where they were at the beginning of the year. And so we are aggressively pursuing that opportunity. It is unlikely to have an impact on 2022 just because of where we are with inventory at this stage and trying to really liquidate a large portion of our inventory. But as we go into 2023, we have not factored that into our transformation savings. So that is an opportunity that we want to pursue. If these spot levels are maintained where they are, that clearly could be a significant opportunity that would improve the performance that we are talking about that could potentially play out for 2023. But as the year goes on and we get more progress in that area and we begin to see the impact of that in the later stages of 2022 as we start to plan for 2023, we will provide more color, but that is an opportunity that is out there that we will be pursuing as it has really reached a level of significance from a spot rate differential versus where it was in April.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to focus you had kind of alluded to your competitive positioning earlier, Don. And I know you put a lot of thought and analysis into that. As you look into the back half, I think there was a part where you said you are still considering surgical price increases. And I'm just kind of curious as you look at how the retail sales backdrop is softening and given the level of competition that is out there, what is the ability to hold on to price in the current environment? And as you look into 2023, you had mentioned that a lot of the cost savings don't necessarily come at the expense of the front forwarding, the front-facing part of the business, so to speak. But to the extent that we are in this reverted or more normalized demand backdrop, which is much less than this past 18-months. How do you assess the need to perhaps invest more in the business and plow some of those cost savings back into the company, either through some targeted price reductions or areas of investment in terms of marketing or R&D.
Donald Allan: Yes. I think, Michael, it is a good question. As you think about the dynamics, we are navigating here. And I guess I will start with, as we have done three rounds of price. I mentioned in my presentation that our price points are very consistent with our competitor price points in virtually every category. So we feel like the current price environment is a level playing field from that perspective. We did mention surgical price increases as an opportunity in the back half. But that is very modest. That is not a large number we are pursuing. Corbin also mentioned, we are not doing a round for price because of the dynamics we just described around commodity prices and slowing demand playing out as well. We also have to remember there was a big part of a front-end inflationary period last year where we didn't have price recovery for the first six to nine-months in some cases of that cycle. And so as the tale of the cycle plays out, where we start to experience deflation, we tend to hold on to the price through the cycle as that tail plays out. And then once we are starting to capture significant benefits in our P&L from commodity deflation, we begin to look at where are our margins, where do we want our margins to go, where is the pricing versus the market, do we need to make some surgical changes based on that. And we have a very robust team and process that we have created over the last two-years that is 100% dedicated to this work in this type of analysis that allows us to be very fluid and agile, but I always remind people of there is a significant gap we had at the beginning of the cycle, where we had very little recovery of inflation versus price. And at the tail, there will be a period of time where we have the benefit of higher prices as commodity inflation is receding or we are having deflation in this particular case. That is the way it is historically paid out. It is most likely the way this is going to play out. That doesn't mean there won't be occasional surgical promotional things that happened versus those list prices to drive higher levels of volume or performance in certain categories. Those things will happen. But in a general playing field, that is likely how the price versus commodity deflation will play out over the next 12 to 18-months.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi good morning and thank you. I suppose I just wanted to sort of circle back on to the margin outlook. Just to try and understand what sort of operating margin trajectory you are dialing in for the back half, any major ramp-up in Q4 there. And also as we think about sort of early 2023, which you have alluded to a few times, do we expect a sort of similar margin rate first half of next year to second half of this year? Just trying to get a bit more color around that and sort of the confidence that once those savings and cost actions are realized you can really retain those in your margins and not have to pass them on.
Donald Allan: Yes. I will start and then pass it over to Corbin for a little more detail. There is nothing unusual in the margins between the two quarters in the back half of this year. So there is no dramatically low number in Q3 and dramatically high number in Q4. They are relatively consistent overall for the company. Corbin talked about what we expect to do with gross margins as a company as we go into next year and getting into the low 30s with a road map for the longer term of 35-plus percent. We believe that is a model that works very effectively for this portfolio of businesses and products. And that is something that if you look at history, you have a history that would demonstrate that. But really, the model that I described when I laid out kind of the strategy of where we need to go and the focus on investing in innovation, investing in commercial leadership, investing in our supply chain, et cetera, et cetera, all those different areas. That consistent investment model will allow for not only strong growth two to three times the market growth but also allows for higher levels of profitability. One of the benefits of having the Pro market and the Pro brand like the Walt in particular, but some of our other niche brands such as Pacome and Proto our programs as well. Obviously, on the Outdoor side, we have got some great brands with Hustler from the Excel acquisition, Cub Cadet DEWALT as well in that category. Those channels have and always have had high levels of profitability. And so that gives us confidence as well because we are looking to continue to shift, especially on the Outdoor side, more and more into the pro category where the higher levels of profitability are. But Corbin, maybe you give a little bit of color on. SP1.
Corbin Walburger: Julian, the only thing else I would add is that if you think about going into 2023, the benefits that we will start to see from a gross margin standpoint from the supply chain transformation and then from an SG&A standpoint, from the other cost reduction that we laid out, those will be pretty even throughout the course of 2023. So you will start to see both gross margin and operating income margin slowly start to improve throughout the year.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We would like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2022 first quarter conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, CEO; and Don Allan, President and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our 2022 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. As such, statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Loree.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Dennis and good morning, everyone. As you saw from this morning's results, we achieved 20% revenue growth and over 200 basis points of sequential gross margin improvement in the first quarter. We benefited from a sustained strong demand environment, significant and growing price realization and our new strategic outdoor acquisitions. The first quarter results illustrate the operational focus and agility of our teams in managing through a choppy external environment characterized by supportive demand. We are executing pricing to offset inflation and restore margins and beginning a very successful integration process with the new outdoor acquisitions. We will benefit from recent portfolio moves which render a more focused company, anchored by our core tools, outdoor and industrial franchises. In this regard, we announced last Friday the sale of our Access Technologies business for $900 million in an all-cash transaction at a compelling valuation. It represents the final step in our security divestiture initiative and was preceded by the announced sale of our Electronic Security business to Securitas in the fourth quarter for $3.2 billion. These transactions, along with the outdoor acquisitions, will further strengthen our position as the number one tools and outdoor company in the world. With these acquisitions and the security divestitures, we have created a business portfolio that is extremely well positioned for sustained long-term growth and margin expansion as well as one that benefits from several positive secular trends and competitive advantages. During the quarter, we also initiated $2.3 billion in share repurchases through an accelerated share repurchase as well as open market buyback activity. These actions represent significant progress towards achieving our goal of returning $4 billion in capital to our shareholders through repurchases which we expect to complete in '23. Taking into account the approximately $0.5 billion in dividends we expect to pay in 2022, we will have returned $2.8 billion to shareholders by the end of the year, a record for Stanley Black & Decker. These important capital allocation actions along with, one, our now demonstrated and continuing ability to achieve substantial price inflation recovery; and two, progress in reducing supply chain constraints will result in higher growth and margin accretion and thus, significant value creation in both the short and long term. To summarize our first quarter, revenues were $4.4 billion, up 20% driven by our outdoor equipment acquisitions. Organic revenue was down 1% and customer demand remained strong across many of our global markets and price realization accelerated sequentially from the fourth quarter. The volume could have been higher but for the supply-constrained environment that we continue to make progress on resolving, with added supply of semiconductors and electronic components during this quarter, we expect to be able to alleviate all major electronics-related constraints by the end of the quarter. Our total company operating margin was 11.5%, up 250 basis points sequentially, reflecting the implementation of new pricing actions but down versus prior year due to cost inflation and supply chain challenges. This resulted in first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.10 which was ahead of our plan. As we look forward, I'd like to share a few comments on what we're seeing in the demand environment. In Tools & Outdoor, end-user demand across most markets and channels has remained stable, led by pro construction. Absolute dollar sell-through in North America retail continues at high levels, especially when measured sequentially and/or compared with the 2019 baseline. Additionally, we believe that we are gaining market share in North America and other geographies. For instance, based on publicly available disclosures by our top 2 home center customers, our 2021 point-of-sale growth was above category line average for each of them. In our end markets today, while the boom global conditions of 2020 and 2021 have leveled off, the fundamentals and secular drivers remain healthy and are still very much intact. As we look out over the balance of the year, the combination of repair/remodel, new residential construction and commercial construction have plenty of runway to continue to drive enduring demand in many of our markets around the world. Despite this factor of slowing global growth and increasing U.S. interest rates, repair/remodel activity is expected to grow at mid- to high single-digit rates over the next 2 years due to multiple factors, including an aging housing stock, record levels of home equity and strong price appreciation driving big ticket remodeling and tight existing housing supply leading consumers to invest in existing homes as well as spurring demand for new homes. In terms of new residential construction, the years of undersupply of new homes post the 2008 economic crisis has created a significant housing stock supply issue as just as millennials reach the age when they're most likely to purchase a home. We expect that this will continue to support new residential construction activity, even with the interest rate increases currently being contemplated by the Fed. Commercial construction is still in the early stages of a post-COVID recovery and the secular drivers for safe, healthy, professional working spaces and more efficient buildings will contribute to positive activity levels in 2022 and the coming years. And lastly, we have strong backlogs in our industrial businesses and we remain optimistic that cyclical recoveries in the auto and the aerospace sectors are beginning to emerge. This is very meaningful to both revenue growth and profitability for the segment. To size it, we think it is a $300 million to $400 million multiyear growth opportunity with accompanying margins returning to the mid- to high teens over time. And while we see continued momentum within our core markets, we will monitor and respond accordingly if and when we observe any adverse impact from a higher interest rate environment and/or significant elasticity of demand effects following our pricing actions. On top of the market, we continue to reinvest in growth, including leading-edge product innovation, e-commerce and electrification that will position us for sustained share gains. In fact, since the start of the pandemic, we have invested in over 1,500 human resource additions in R&D, commercial and e-commerce functions in Tools & Outdoor. And that is before the impact of any acquisitions. On that note, I'll now address our recent capital allocation and portfolio actions. A key aspect of the Stanley Black & Decker value-creation model is our active approach to portfolio management and commitment to an investor-friendly capital allocation strategy. Over the long term, we look to invest 50% of our excess capital into strategic M&A and return the other 50% to shareholders through a consistent growing dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. The 2 security divestitures were at a trailing EBITDA multiples of mid- to high teens and have a headline price of $4.1 billion in the aggregate, resulting in approximately $3.5 billion of after-tax proceeds. These impressive results validate the investments we made in transforming our security business over the last several years and have enabled significant return of capital to shareholders as well as reinvestment in our highly focused core businesses. Deploying capital into outdoor enabled us to acquire approximately $3 billion of revenue at 8.5x EBITDA and a material opportunity for margin enhancement over time as we fully integrate these businesses and leverage our combined scale, brands, manufacturing expertise, R&D and access to both the retail and the pro channels. Now there has been some noise and misinformation out there about our recent outdoor acquisitions and I'm now going to present you with the facts. We have a sound strategy for outdoor anchored on 4 pillars: electrification, brand and channel strength, cutting-edge innovation and large-format manufacturing capacity and experience. Overnight, we have assembled a formidable leading player in the $25 billion outdoor power equipment market that is capable of growing 10% to 15% organically at mid-teens operating margin for many years to come. This business will lead the charge in the electrification of both large-format and handheld professional outdoor power equipment. We will also bring our outstanding differentiated line of autonomous electrified products under the DEWALT brand to the professional landscaping channel, where the acquisitions comes in network of independent dealers with 2,500 unique outlets, skewing towards the pro market and representing half of the $25 billion addressable market. Such channel access represents a compelling competitive advantage and it is critical to above-average growth and profitability. I'm also excited about the breakthrough innovations resulting from the integration of the outdoor acquisitions. And even though the new team just completed its first quarter together, they've been working together for several years and will bring to market a strong set of new innovations at attractive margins just ahead of the 2023 outdoor season. We're off to a great start and I have strong conviction in our ability to deliver outstanding cordless and autonomous new products to the market that will result in growth and margin expansion. And the 13.7% operating margin delivered in our first quarter together is just a taste of the profitability potential ahead in the coming years. And lastly, we have added 8 manufacturing locations through our outdoor acquisitions. In addition to the instant capacity to support growing demand, the resulting extensive manufacturing footprint gives us an enormous competitive advantage over our small-format, electric-only competitors. In short, despite what you may have heard, our outdoor acquisitions have enabled us to become the outdoor power equipment leader, best positioned to electrify the industry given our multiple competitive advantages. Our outdoor business is now a powerful growth engine with approximately $4-plus billion in annual revenue with anticipated organic growth of 10% to 15% a year. This is an exciting period for our company with a portfolio focused on core businesses in tools, outdoor and industrial and attractive markets in construction, DIY, automotive and industrial. And I'd now like to turn the call over to Don Allan, who will provide an update on how we're positioning our supply chain for growth as well as more detailed commentary on first quarter actuals and our full year outlook. Don?
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned in his comments, our focus remains on ensuring we serve the continued healthy demand and investing in our supply chain to further strengthen our position for sustained growth. As I've highlighted on prior calls, we took multiple actions in 2021 to navigate through the global supply chain challenges and further strengthen our manufacturing capacity, sourcing, operational efficiency and agility. These actions are allowing us to better serve our customers and deliver growth in revenue and cash flow in 2022 and beyond. Key areas of investment included adding capacity consistent with our make where we sell strategy, co-investing with strategic sourcing partners with a focus on batteries and electronic components and deploying our manufacturing 4.0 automation solutions to enhance productivity, labor efficiency and competitive costs. Our investments in this area as well as our electronic component availability continue to progress as expected and remain on track. Demand continues to outpace availability for our hottest products amid this constrained supply chain environment. First, as it relates to inventory, our actions will position us to meet the current demand levels while improving working capital to deliver strong cash flow generation. Greater working capital efficiency and cash flow generation remains a significant opportunity in 2022 and beyond. As a reminder, last year, we made significant investments in inventory to help meet the outsized demand in the tools business. Our 2022 cash flow guidance assumes that we can modestly reduce inventory versus 2021 levels and we expect much of that improvement to occur in the second half of the year once we get through this spring to early summer selling season. Our inventory at the end of Q1 was up approximately $850 million versus the year-end '21 balance. The increase in our first quarter inventory was primarily due to working capital seasonality to support the peak outdoor buying season, spring merchandising and the Father's Day selling season. This investment in working capital, coupled with the earlier timing of certain tax payments, contributed to a free cash outflow of $1.4 billion in the first quarter. This Q1 performance will reverse as we execute on the remaining 2022 working capital initiatives. Within the supply chain, tight component supply and elongated transportation times continue to be a challenge. However, we have seen some signs of stabilization. For example, our goods in transit for the quarter remained stable and similar to year-end levels. The Port of L.A. has seen improvements with reduced congestion and moving goods from the ports to our DCs is not a significant source of delays. As it relates to China, we continue to frequently monitor our end-to-end supply chain. And while there has been some minor COVID-driven disruption to date, it remains manageable at this stage. This is a dynamic situation that we will continue to watch closely in the coming weeks. As it relates to semiconductors, we continue to see improved supply in line with expectations. Our Tier 1 contract manufacturers received more semiconductors in the first quarter which will enable us to increase the throughput for our professional power tools in Q2. We are on track for an improvement to our electronic component supply of approximately 20% in 2Q and further improvement in 3Q which will support better fill rates, customer inventory positions and higher revenues as we progress through the remainder of the year. So in summary, we are actively managing a very dynamic supply chain and responding with agility to position ourselves to meet the continued strong demand we are experiencing, especially within the professional power tool portion of our business. Turning to our segment results. The headline for the first quarter is that demand for our products remains healthy and we are executing the necessary pricing actions to mitigate higher input costs. In Tools & Outdoor, we grew revenue 24% as the strategic outdoor power equipment acquisitions contributed 27% and price drove 5 points of growth. Price realization accelerated sequentially because of the new global price increases implemented in response to commodity and transportation inflation experienced in late 2021. These factors were partially offset by a 6% decline in volume and 2% from currency. Volume was impacted by electronic component availability and we have not seen evidence of broad demand destruction related to price elasticity. We estimate that supply constraints resulted in approximately $200 million in unfulfilled professional power tool opportunities in the first quarter which, if realized, would have resulted in volume growth and a record prior year performance comp. We will better position to capitalize on this volume opportunity as we improve supply in the coming 2 quarters. Regional organic growth was relatively in line with our expectations, with Europe up 2%, emerging markets contributing 5% and North America down 3%. The Tools & Outdoor operating margin rate for the segment was 14%, representing a 260 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to execute on price to protect our margins and we saw the sequential benefit in Q1. Comparing the Tools & Outdoor margin rate versus prior year, we experienced the decline as price realization was more than offset by inflation, higher transportation costs, growth investments and lower volume. The outdoor acquisitions were near line average margin rates for the quarter, representing a very strong start to the year. U.S. retail point-of-sale remains at healthy levels, supported by strong professional construction markets and our innovation. While the POS comps were down versus a stimulus-aided Q1 2021, the normalized 2019 comparative growth rates accelerated from the levels we experienced in the back half of 2021. This strengthens our conviction that we continue to experience a very solid demand environment. Now turning to the Tools & Outdoor SBUs. Power tools was down 1% organically in the quarter. We continue to realize benefits from our price increases, along with continued demand for our innovative offerings for the pro and tradesperson. We have launched a series of products under our industry-leading CRAFTSMAN, STANLEY FATMAX, Black & Decker and DEWALT brands. Our recent breakthrough, DEWALT POWERSTACK, continues to be very well received by end users and is expected to be a multi-hundred million dollar contributor to growth in 2022. Hand tools, accessories and storage declined 1% in the quarter against a very difficult comparable. Revenue was supported by pricing and new product innovation. Some of our new innovations include extending our world's first DEWALT 20-volt laser platform with the new 20-volt MAX laser, expanding our DEWALT ToughSystem storage to include soft storage solutions designed to optimize efficiency in organization and we added a new IRWIN STRAIT-LINE tape to our industry-leading tape measure lineup. Moving to outdoor products. This business grew 4% organically, while the addition of MTD and Excel added over $800 million of revenue. Growth was driven by price realization, expanded distribution and new product innovations under the Black & Decker CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT brands. Our acquisitions are also benefiting from product innovation, including recent launches such as the redesigned FasTrak zero-turn mower line for commercial use and the first semi-autonomous zero-turn mower with the Cub Cadet SurePath. Despite the strong start for these acquisitions, this growth was modestly impacted from a later breaking outdoor season due to colder weather in many parts of North America. We expect these revenues to be recovered in the second and third quarter. Our first full quarter as one outdoor team was very successful and we remain on track to integrate 3 assets into a new $4 billion revenue platform, as you heard from Jim. As the integration progresses, we continue to build conviction around the innovation, growth and synergy opportunities. We are even more excited about the electrification growth opportunity as we work to integrate these organizations and processes. The team is energized, focused and off to a great start. I want to thank the Tools & Outdoor organization for their efforts in the first quarter. We made progress against our key operational goals for 2022 with strong price realization, improved power tool supply and actioning a strong plan for working capital reduction as we move throughout the year. This dynamic environment requires agility and I know we have the right people with the perseverance and dedication to be successful. Now, shifting to Industrial. Segment revenue declined 2% versus last year as the 5 points of price realization were more than offset by a 5% volume decline and a 2% negative impact from currency. Operating margin was 6.9% as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation and market-driven volume declines, in particular, in our higher-margin automotive business where our customers remain constrained by their own supply chain challenges. Looking within the segment, engineered fastening organic revenues were down 3% as 5% general industrial fastener growth was more than offset by lower automotive OEM production as well as a modest decline in aerospace. Our auto fastener business continues to successfully operate in a dynamic environment with customer production fluctuations. Despite this, auto fasteners once again demonstrated outperformance versus light vehicle production. And the business is also benefiting from accelerating growth and content gains across the electric vehicle production space. Our industrial fastener business enjoys a healthy backlog and delivered growth at nearly 2x global IPI in the first quarter. The aerospace fastener business delivered its third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement. This business is focused on capturing the recovery in the OEM production which is beginning to emerge. We expect in 2022 aero fasteners will begin to demonstrate organic growth as it starts the cyclical recovery back towards historical levels of revenue. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 4% as 13% growth in attachment tools were partially offset by lower pipeline project activity in oil and gas. Momentum remains strong in attachment tools driven by record backlogs, dealer inventories continuing to trend below targeted levels and elevated market confidence due to the U.S. infrastructure bill. Our Industrial team is continuing to make steady progress with its revenue and profitability improvements. And we are primed to leverage the cyclical recovery that is on the horizon and capitalize on the auto electrification trend as well. Turning to the next slide. The operating environment continues to be dynamic and the recent invasion in the Ukraine by Russia has driven a new wave of inflation versus the backdrop earlier this year. From an input cost perspective, our updated expectations for 2022 commodity inflation and cost to serve is now $1.4 billion versus our January expectation of $800 million. The key drivers of the incremental $600 million reflects significant increases in battery inputs such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, oil-related inputs such as transport and resins and continued upward movements in other base metals and steel. Looking at the commodity indices since we issued our initial 2022 guidance, lithium, nickel and cobalt are all up approximately 90%, 50% and 7%, respectively, whereas oil is also up nearly 15%. If we break down the $600 million increase, it is in primarily 4 major categories: $200 million in batteries, $200 million in transportation costs, $100 million in resins due to oil prices and $50 million in gas engine costs. If you look at our commodity basket discretely, the increase to our total direct material spend is up over 30% since the end of 2020. Nearly half of this total impact occurred in February and March of this year. While these commodities continue to be volatile today, we do have solid visibility to the expected sustained impact. And we are building this into the plan and taking additional pricing actions to offset the impact to our margins. We have executed 3 rounds of price which are now in place across our global businesses. And we are in the process of implementing additional price actions in response to the new wave of inflation that has occurred in the last 60 days. These new price actions will be on top of the 6 to 7 points of price we included in our prior guidance and we now expect price to contribute high single digits for 2022. Our teams remain focused on pricing actions to offset the cumulative inflation impacts experienced in the last 9 to 10 months. We believe this will allow us to expand our core margins and that will begin to emerge in late 2022. As a reminder, before diving into the details on Slide 9, our guidance does not include our security businesses which are now recorded as discontinued operations. So moving on to our 2022 guidance. We are planning for total revenue growth in the mid-20s, inclusive of organic growth of 7%. We are updating our adjusted earnings per share to a range of $9.50 up to $10.50. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $7.20 up to $8.30, inclusive of onetime charges related to restructuring expenses, a voluntary retirement program, the Russian business closure and acquisition-related costs. The current estimate for pretax charges in 2022 is approximately $460 million. On the right side of the slide, we have outlined the components of our EPS adjustment versus our prior estimate. We made 2 portfolio decisions since January guidance which reduced EPS by $0.45. The divestiture of our Stanley Access Technologies business reduces EPS by $0.30. And there will be a $0.15 impact from the closure of our Russian business. Therefore, the January guidance midpoint adjusted for these 2 decisions is $11.80. Incremental commodity and cost to serve just discussed results in a $3 cost increase or reduction in EPS. Then you have the offset of the outlined price actions which add $1.70 benefit which is a net of a lower volume planning assumption to protect ourselves for any potential demand elasticity. Below-the-line items are relatively neutral as a lower tax rate and other expense assumptions are offset by the impact of shares from an adoption of a new accounting standard in Q1 related to preferred shares. This accounting standard change will only impact 2022 and reverses in 2023 as these shares will be retired in November of '22. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic growth is expected to be in the mid- to high single digits, supported by price, core and breakthrough innovation and healthy demand across our end markets. We expect that our strategic outdoor acquisitions will contribute just over $3 billion in revenue in 2022. For the full year, Tools & Outdoor consolidated margins are expected to be down on a year-over-year basis as inflation and acquisition mix pressure margins. As you think about Tools & Outdoor margins, excluding acquisitions, our plan calls for a relatively similar OEM in the second quarter to what we just delivered in Q1. We then expect year-over-year core margins to be up in the back half. There is a meaningful midterm opportunity to improve margins within the outdoor acquisitions over the coming years. And this continues to be a significant priority for us. We expect high single-digit margins this year and we see the potential for low double-digit margins over the next few years. We believe the Industrial segment will achieve low double-digit organic growth driven by innovation, pricing and cyclical recoveries across much of the portfolio. The Industrial margin rate is expected to be positive year-over-year. Leveraging strong revenue growth, productivity and price, this segment will experience sequential improvement each quarter in 2022. Let's now shift to some color on Q2, full year cash flow and our share repurchase program. We expect the second quarter adjusted EPS will approximate 21% to 22% of the full year. This assumes low single-digit organic growth and a strong revenue contribution from acquisitions. Now, turning to cash flow. As a result of our lower full earnings guidance and higher inventory values at year-end due to the additional wave of inflation we experienced in the last 60 days, we expect free cash flow to now be in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. This range does still reflect a modest working capital reduction year-over-year. We still plan to complete our $4 billion share repurchase program. However, since we see a lower cash flow performance in 2022 for the reasons just articulated, we will defer the remaining portion of -- or $1.7 billion until 2023. We continue to pursue a disciplined capital allocation approach that aims to balance share repurchase activity with a commitment to dividends and strong investment-grade credit ratings. We are committed to the completion of this repurchase program in 2023. The organization is focused on execution in this dynamic environment, with the key operational priorities centered around the following areas: improving supply chain and customer service levels, driving above-market organic growth, delivering on our price and cost control measures, successfully integrating our strategic outdoor acquisitions, closing the 2 security divestitures later in this year as planned and leveraging the SBD operating model to improve our working capital efficiency in 2022 and beyond. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim?
Jim Loree: Thank you, Don. There is no question that we are operating in one of the more challenging environments in recent times. And to succeed in such an environment, we are intensely focused on the inputs we can control. We've strategically optimized our business portfolio, creating a stronger, faster growing and highly profitable company with distinctive competitive advantages. We've continued our long history of returning excess capital to shareholders through our impressive annual dividend record and share repurchases, together totaling almost $3 billion in 2022 with more to come in 2023. We've reinvested in our core businesses, adding resources to support our growth catalysts in electrification, e-commerce and innovation. This type of focused reinvestment will be an ongoing and consistent approach for us and the company going forward and we've made substantial progress in resolving supply chain constraints, most of which are expected to dissipate during the balance of this year. And we have now proven our ability to offset the impact of hyperinflation through pricing actions that stick. We've made an enormous commitment to ESG as we've shifted our business portfolio to areas that both support growth and benefit our stakeholders and society. For an impressive immersion into this topic, I refer you to our 2021 ESG report which is available online effective today. And we are confident in the strategic positioning of our company and look forward to continuing to demonstrate our ability to thrive in 2022 and beyond by driving top and bottom line growth and shareholder value creation. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning. I guess just on price and I guess it's going to be a multipart question. But the argument here is you're pursuing price to offset cost. But based on the bridge, it looks like pricing is aiming at maybe offsetting 1/2 to 1/3 of the cost pressure. So maybe you could put that in some additional context. Perhaps it's the annualization of the way things work through the system. Are you actually targeting full recovery at a run rate with the price actions that you're taking? And separately, I wonder if you could just provide a little bit of color on what you might be doing to try to mitigate the incremental cost pressure that you laid out for us here.
Don Allan: Yes, Jeff. So you're right on the commentary around the timing of the pricing. So the pricing impact in 2022 will be about roughly half the impact of what the annualized amount will be. So there'll be a carryover positive into 2023 related to pricing. And it's really due to the timing of -- as the inflation comes in, you have a timing aspect of being able to get price increases into the market. That can be anywhere from 3 to 4 months depending on the customer or the region. In some cases, it can be faster in certain regions around the globe. And so it's just factoring in that dynamic that is -- like we experienced last year and in early parts of this year as well. The question around -- what was the second part of the question, Dennis?
Dennis Lange: What are you doing on the cost...
Don Allan: The cost mitigation as you related to, the inflationary costs as they come in, we go through a very similar process, frankly, we experience with our customers which is justification of the cost, what's driving the cost increase. It's got to go through a review process with our GSM procurement organization and then has various approvals that has to go through as well before we can accept the cost increase. The projection that we're putting forth out there related to inflation is based on current spot prices for the most part. And so it assumes these spot prices stay in place for the remainder of the year going into next year. We don't know if that will be the case, they could go up or they could go down. And that's something that we'll see over time. But we manage it through a very robust process on the input side, very similar to what we see what our customers do with us to help justify why we're doing price increases as well.
Jim Loree: And just for clarity, I think Don made this clear but I'm just going to emphasize that we are aiming to offset with our fourth price increase now over a 2-year period the entire amount of the inflation. So it's just a matter of timing. We got hit with this latest tranche of $600 million of inflation in the last 2 months. It takes a little time to get that price -- those price increases implemented and that's the dynamic at play here. There's no long-term degradation of margins associated with the hyperinflation because we are absolutely and I'm very, very pleased actually with the ability to implement price and offset the inflation with price increases because, historically, we never had this type of hyperinflation and we never had 100% price coverage of the inflation. And this era that we're in, we've been able to prove that we can do that successfully and that's what we're going to do here and the fourth increase as we go out to market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. So I just wanted to home in on that sort of price-cost delta again. So I think pricing was maybe -- I don't know, maybe $200 million or so in Q1. Maybe help us understand what was the gross cost headwind in Q1. And then how do we think about those 2 numbers in the second half? And as you kind of snap the line today, what's the cost headwind looking like for '23 at this point?
Don Allan: Yes. So obviously, we had, as we mentioned in January, a very significant inflationary impact in Q1. And the number approximated a little more than $400 million. We expect probably a very similar number in Q2. And back in January, we were assuming in Q3 and Q4 those numbers were going to become very small. With the new wave of headwinds, we have a number that's about $300 million per quarter in the back half of the year. So that's a large part of the change. You've got certainly a bigger impact in Q2 than what we saw in the January guidance. That's about $400 million, where that was supposed to be ticking down. And then you had close to almost a neutral impact in the January guidance in Q3 and Q4. And now it's going to be roughly $300 million per quarter. The carryover impact, you'll have some inflationary carryover impact, obviously, with this new wave, maybe a quarter to 1.5 quarters of that into next year. And then you'll have a substantial price increase carryover as well that the price should exceed the inflation in 2023.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Hey, good morning, everyone. I appreciate taking my question. I wanted to actually -- a lot has been talked about, obviously, pricing, cost and I appreciate all the details. I wanted to actually shift a second to the outdoor business and the comments around the 10% to 15% annual growth that you highlighted. It sounds a little more bullish than before. And I just wanted to make sure that I was thinking about that correctly that this is -- the statement of a double-digit organic growth rate is something new into the equation. What's kind of driving that statement either from organic growth or new product introductions, distribution gains, etcetera? And then just one technical question, if you can lay out the share count progression over the next couple of quarters, understanding there might be some accounting issues that go away for next year. But just from a modeling perspective, that would be very helpful as well.
Jim Loree: That's an artful one question but we'll take it. Don will take the second part, I'll take the first. We didn't get into this outdoor business because we thought it was low margin, low growth. And we are extremely pleased with what we've acquired and the teams that have come with these acquisitions. The innovation or new product development pipeline is revolutionary and especially in the professional products area and especially as it relates to the large format, zero turns and riders. It is clear that electrification will be an increasing force in this market with the advent of ESG and with the increased energy prices. So one of the factors that has slowed the adoption of electric large format has been the differential between the price for electric and the price for gas. And it historically has been fairly wide but it's coming -- it's converging as electric gets down the cost curve through innovation and cost reduction and energy prices drive higher prices for internal combustion-powered equipment and regulatory action has begun. So in the States, you have heard about regulatory action in several states, led by California. And so there is going to be a very, very significant amount of pressure to convert much of the gasoline to powered unit sales to electric. And we see that accelerating. We see the fact that we have been working together for several years on revolutionary innovation in electric and autonomous. And by the way, the labor shortages that exist all around and the cost of increasing labor are another factor getting us excited about the growth because the autonomous units that we have can literally cut lawns for landscapers without people on the mower. So there's a bunch of factors that make us very excited about what's happening in the market. And then there are the 8 facilities that we own that are up and running that make everything from walk-behind mowers to zero turns to basic riders. So we are poised and ready to go with products, with capacity and with a great team -- management team. So 10% to 15% in a market that has historically grown in the high single digits, mid- to high single digits is something that we think is very achievable. And we're going to make investments to support that.
Don Allan: And your question on shares, Michael, it's -- I think the easiest thing, if you look at the next 3 quarters for the remainder of the year, it will average about $155 million. In the first quarter, it was about $165 million -- shares. Sorry, not dollars, shares [ph].
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: Hey everybody, good morning. Maybe just on the volumes within Tools. It does seem like there's a little bit of a lower assumption there. I think volume kind of on an implied basis might be kind of flat to down now and you had kind of low to mid-single digits before. So could you just maybe walk through the drivers of that, especially since it sounds like POS is still doing pretty well and the inventory in North America is pretty low versus the industry?
Don Allan: Yes. As I have mentioned in some of my comments, Tim, we have done a little bit of a haircut on the volume side versus January. It's down about 3 points from our original assumption. And that's really factored in just more price increases going into the market, maybe being a little more cautious on the impact on volume. It's not necessarily a view that we think demand is slowing. It's just more of with all the price increases going in, you're going to have -- we had almost 5.5% of price in the first quarter. We're going to have somewhere between 7.5% to 8% of price in Q2 and then it's going to get close to 10% in Q3 and Q4. That's a lot of price in the market very quickly. And so we thought it was prudent to just do a modest haircut on the volume side to represent the potential impact of all those price increases. But it is not an assumption that there's some significant slowdown related to overall demand. Other than what's happening in Russia which is relatively modest, it's an annual revenue of about $150 million.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Good morning. I think I will keep this to one question. So obviously, Don, you've been chasing the curve on inflation all the way up here. What -- you've kind of reset the inflation expectation. How do you take a step to try and ring-fence the plan now for FY '22? I mean, is there any buffer in there to maybe protect into further inflation? And then broadly speaking, it seems that the China supply chain, the context of the supply chain is really causing a lot of transportation and freight inflation. What steps are you taking to accelerate the transition back to domestic manufacturing?
Don Allan: Yes. I would say that the first question, as I said, we're projecting inflation assuming current indices. And so we're projecting that's going to continue for the remainder of the year. Some people view that as maybe potentially conservative view. It's hard to make that view based on the level of inflation that we've seen over the last 12 months. Like any guidance we provide, we always put some level of contingency in there. It's usually in the $100 million to $150 million range. And I would say that's consistent with this particular guidance we just provided. As far as the China situation, yes, we're obviously watching what's happening very closely from a tactical perspective. But as we had mentioned in previous calls, we did open several plants in the North American markets between U.S. and Mexico to really be able to -- before the pandemic, to really receive a lot of the Asian production, in particular, the China production into those Mexican facilities and some -- and one U.S. facility as well. Because of the volume increase of roughly 20% in '21 and 20% in '22 -- I'm sorry, '21 and '20, you've had a significant spike in the overall output and therefore, it's been difficult to ramp down the Asian production. So we are looking at 2 different things. One, some additional expansion opportunities in both those countries of Mexico and the United States. But we've also been accelerating our manufacturing 4.0 automation and digitization efforts across the supply chain to try to accelerate that. We believe at this point we can make significant progress in this transition over the next 18 to 24 months. We will not completely mitigate the risk in that time frame but we have an accelerated plan based on the current revenue projections as well as the potential for more revenue growth to accelerate that progress over that time frame and we believe we can dramatically mitigate that risk and concern.
Jim Loree: And it goes beyond just risk management. That's a huge part of it but also working capital management and efficiency. Getting the production closer to the market, within the home market, enables faster cycle times. It enables more ability to respond to volatile changes in demand which is the nature of the world today. And I think as e-commerce becomes more prominent, it's more important to have that production and supply chain closer to the customer, again, for purposes of agility and responsiveness. So there are offensive reasons for doing this as well. So it has a double benefit, a defensive risk management side to it but also an offensive go-to-market advantage in supply chain responsiveness for a changing end market in terms of what's expected and changing channel needs as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Joe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. I wanted to circle back to volume. You gave some helpful color on price and cadence over the course of the year and wondered if you could talk a little bit about the volume cadence specifically in Tools. And as you have maybe a little bit of -- I don't know if you call it buffer or cushion in there just related to uncertainties around what the pricing is going to do on demand. But generally, what the framework looks like and whether kind of back half of the year, we're talking volume that's more kind of flattish? Or are you anticipating volume declines in each quarter?
Don Allan: Yes, I would say that you'll see a volume decline again in Q2, mid- to low single-digit decline. You'll see modest growth in volume in the back half, 1 or 2 points in Q3 or Q4 as the supply continues to improve, in particular, in the professional power tools space.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David MacGregor: Yes. Good morning, everyone. I guess a question on volume and you made reference to some of the new plants that you were ramping. Just wondering if you could talk about kind of the progress there and whether that's representing a sort of a bottleneck right now because maybe there's supply channel issues associated with supporting those plants as they ramp or if maybe that's not the case, maybe you could address that. And also just talk about the unabsorbed cost of ramping those plants through 2022 and what that might represent.
Don Allan: Yes. The unabsorbed cost is not significant. Those plants have been ramping up for a period of time. And as the year goes on, they're going to continue to become more and more efficient. The main bottleneck is really semiconductors and the electronic components that they go into. As I mentioned in my commentary and Jim's commentary, that's going to continue to get better. There's a big step-up happening in Q2 of about 20% improvement. And we'll see another improvement in the back half of the year as well. And so as that starts to shake loose, we'll be able to meet the current demand levels and hopefully be able to look at other opportunities above and beyond the demand levels at that stage. The capacity in our plants is not really the challenge. The challenge is really in one particular area that I just touched on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.
Eric Bosshard: Thanks. You talked about favorable tool market share performance over the last year. And I know this is a point of discussion. Just curious what you think you're doing, what you were affected at in 1Q with tool market share and then what your assumption is for further tool market share progress in the back half of the year, especially with your thoughts on volume and guidance on volume for tools for the back half.
Jim Loree: Yes. I mean we've been gaining share year in and year out for a long time. During the pandemic, the competitive dynamics are such that we have been gaining share at a slower rate than one of our other competitors. And we're roughly the same size now in power tools and we're bigger in total with hand tools and other items. But the share dynamics as we look at this year will be very interesting. This competitor ended up buying pretty substantial quantities of batteries and semiconductors prior to the pandemic. They've built several billion dollars’ worth of inventory during the pandemic. They have -- a lot of their business is done on an FOB Asia perspective which means -- they're not reporting sellout. They're reporting sell-in. And a lot of the challenges that we have with the supply chain and the congestion on the Pacific Ocean, in their case, relate to their customer and who bears the burden of, at least for a good part of their business, those challenges. So this supply constraint issue has resulted in their ability to grow share a bit faster in this time period. When that gets resolved, I would bet on our channel access, our product innovation and our growing reinvestment in tools and outdoor and our outdoor platform in general to continue to help us grow the market share. And it will be an interesting couple of years as we go forward. But we're still very, very focused on gaining share, growing above market and continuing to, with our new focused portfolio, compete very, very aggressively and effectively.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-01 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2021 fourth quarter and full year conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, CEO; Don Allen, President and CFO. And our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation, which we'll refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 A.M. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our 2021 fourth quarter and full year results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that you may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Loree.
Jim Loree: Good morning and thank you, Dennis. As you saw from our press release, we delivered a record year in ’21 for revenue, organic growth, and EPS. We benefited from extraordinarily strong customer demand, which continues for our innovative products and portfolio of brands, both of which underpin and support our position as the world's number one tool company. I want to thank our colleagues across the globe for their unwavering commitment to serve our customers with the highest quality products as well as for their outstanding effort in helping to deliver this record-setting performance amidst the confluence of COVID era challenges related to supply chain inflation, other external factors. And during the year, we took several significant strategic actions to optimize our business portfolio, completing two outdoor power equipment acquisitions, adding $3 billion of revenue as well as the announced divestiture of our Electronic Security business for 16 times EBITDA, sharpening our focus on tools, outdoor, and industrial. These transactions are reshaping our portfolio into a faster growing, more profitable one with lots of runway to both support and benefit from the ESG movement as well. This portfolio will also benefit from important societal trends, including household formation, increased consumer nesting with focus on the home and garden, electrification, and infrastructure investment. In addition, this month, we plan to begin the return of $4 billion of capital to our shareholders through our previously announced share repurchase program, including as much as $2 billion to $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022. We believe these transactions, the acquisitions, the divestiture, and our substantial repurchase will result in significant value creation for investors in the short, medium, and long-term. To summarize our 2021 performance, our revenues were $15.6 billion, up 20%, driven by a record 17% organic growth, with all businesses contributing. Our total company operating margin rate for the year was 13.9%, down versus prior year due to the growing cost inflation and supply chain challenges that emerged as the year progressed, as we chose to take the necessary steps to deliver for our customers. We see this core margin rate as a temporary trough, given that we expect our continued 2021, 2022 pricing actions will be sufficient to fully offset the $1.4 billion of cost growth associated with inflation and increased cost to serve during the same two-year time period. Full year 2021 adjusted EPS was $10.48, a 30% increase versus 2020. And for the year ahead, we have a proactive plan and approach that is focused on execution, growth, margin improvement and strong cash flow. Our teams are focused on leveraging our operating model and execution principles that have allowed us to deliver consistent, strong revenue and EPS growth over many years, including in 2021. Although, we were pleased with the total year revenue and EPS performance, the fourth quarter was challenging, with supply chain and inflationary impacts, which impacted working capital. We strategically prioritized building additional inventory in 2021 to capture the strong demand. And in addition, we experienced the impacts from the clogged supply chain, which intensified as the year progressed as component shortages, shipping delays and inflation drove inventory levels even higher. Accordingly, free cash flow for the year was $144 million, which reflects a $1.8 billion increase in inventory. Suffice it to say this working capital increase was higher than anticipated, unnecessary but partially temporary investment which will reverse by at least $500 million this year, converting working capital back to a cash generator during the year. Our team has a long history of driving working capital turns improvement and asset efficiency with our SBD operating model. We have comprehensive enterprise-wide plans in place to ensure we serve our customers while also delivering strong cash flow in 2022 and beyond. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter. Revenue was up 2% to $4.1 billion with 5 points of price, 6 points from acquisitions. Volume was down 8% due to promotional shipment timing in 2020 and was impacted by logistical supply chain challenges as well. Overall, we remain confident in our multi-year growth and margin expansion plans. There are several positive secular demand trends that are benefiting our businesses. We remain bullish on construction, DIY as well as gradual recoveries in the automotive and aerospace OEM markets. We've developed an array of growth catalysts, including product innovation, e-commerce and electrification to position our businesses to capture this opportunity. And we are continuing to focus on innovation, manufacturing, automation, capacity expansion and our logistics capabilities to meet the elevated demand in the near-term and support strong sustainable growth over the medium and long-term. In this regard, we believe that we are well positioned in 2022 with a target of 7% to 8% organic growth; total revenue growth aggregating over $4 billion; adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 19%; and $2 billion of free cash flow. As noted, our tools and outdoor businesses enjoyed high demand levels across our global markets and channels. And as we think about some of the causal factors in North America, many of the traditional drivers of housing and repair/ remodel activity are trending in a positive direction. Household formation, driven by millennial first-time home purchasers as well as the urban exodus support strong housing demand and the low levels of existing housing inventory will continue to be a catalyst for new residential construction. Home prices have appreciated, building home equity, which generally supports home reinvestment growth through repair and remodel activity. In recent years, the consumer mindset and behavior patterns regarding home and garden have shifted as more time is spent in these environments. Homebase for many has grown in importance, serving multiple purposes, including as a sanctuary, as a locus for increased indoor, outdoor activities and as a workspace for more permanent remote and hybrid workers. These behavioral shifts are driving robust project activity for both contractors and DIYers not only in the US but globally as well. Leading indicators for non-resi construction, such as ABI and Dodge rebounded during much of 2021 and have remained positive as construction activity has continued to recover. Industrial production is returning to pre-pandemic levels as manufacturers look to replenish their supply chains. The growth momentum that we built in 2021 in our industrial fastener and attachment tools businesses is expected to continue in 2022, and we expect to benefit from the recently signed $1.2 trillion US infrastructure bill as well. And lastly, we are cautiously optimistic that the cyclical recovery in auto and aero will begin to emerge in 2022, a $300 million to $400 million multiyear revenue growth opportunity for industrial. And so while there is much to be excited about within our core markets, we will carefully watch for any impacts from a higher interest rate environment or changes in the elasticity of demand following price increases and react accordingly if things change. To keep our market and brand vitality fresh, we continue to invest selectively in growth catalysts, including innovation, e-commerce and electrification. These will position us for sustained share gains in the future. These catalysts capitalize on key global trends, many of which are expected to continue in the coming years. Across the board, we have competitive strategic differentiators that make us the world's leading tool company. Our iconic brands, DEWALT, Craftsman, Stanley, STANLEY FATMAX and BLACK+DECKER, our category depth channel development and operations excellence are coupled with a track record and commitment to market leading innovation. Our new power stack battery system launched in December is enjoying an excellent market reception and has the potential for several hundred million dollars of organic growth in 2022. Popular science called it, quote-unquote, “the best cordless power tool battery we've ever used.” With our sharpened focus and increased innovation investments, our product development plans are robust as we look to nearly double the number of professional power tool products we offer over the next three years. The rapid acceleration and the shift of demand to e-commerce has continued, and we believe that we have at least twice the revenue in this channel as our next closest competitor. In 2021, we continue to enjoy strong double-digit growth in e-commerce, and it now represents a $2.5 billion channel for us globally and it's approaching 20% of our tool business revenue. The increased societal focus on ESG and climate and what that means for electrification presents a very attractive multiyear opportunity for outdoor power equipment. Our existing business grew almost 40% in 2021 as we continue to drive the conversion of handheld units and push mowers to cordless electric. With the addition of MTD and Excel in late 2021, we have assembled a $4 billion outdoor power franchise, which will lead the conversion of larger equipment such as riders and zero turns to electric and autonomous as well. We have the ability to capitalize on the electrification of automotive as well through engineered fastening. This moves from internal combustion to plug-in hybrid and EV platforms ultimately results in a 3 to 6x increase in Stanley Black & Decker dollar content per vehicle produced by OEMs. We are also focused on the other growth and revenue synergy opportunities in outdoor, such as global channel expansion and brand development. We have a compelling opportunity to serve the professional customer segment by developing gas and electric offerings under the DEWALT brand, among others. We now have access to more than 2,500 independent equipment dealers across the US that carry leading-edge higher-margin products, which serve a professional user. This dealer channel opportunity is compelling as it is sized similarly to the retail channel, but comes with historically higher profitability. Finally, we have an opportunity in the $4 billion high-margin parts and service segment as we build our presence, serve our customers. I'm excited to share that we are updating our expectations for 2022 EPS contribution from these outdoor acquisitions. MTD had a strong finish in 2021 and was able to outperform our initial plan for both revenue and margin. They also remain on track with their margin improvement trajectory as they did a nice job in 2021, implementing price actions to counter inflation and are continuing to do that in 2022. With a higher '21 base and improved forward outlook, we now expect our outdoor acquisitions to contribute $0.85 of EPS in 2022. This represents a $0.20 improvement and a $0.60 year-over-year tailwind for EPS growth. As I sum up my section today, I am excited by the portfolio changes we affected in 2021. The establishment of a high potential outdoor platform, the Security business divestiture and a commitment to repurchase $4 billion in 2022 all set the stage for value creation this year and beyond.  With that, I will turn it over to Don Allan, who will provide some additional insights. Don?
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned, we are focused on serving robust demand and investing in our supply chain to position us for sustained growth. We took multiple actions in 2021 to navigate the global supply chain and position the business to have the capacity, sourcing, operational efficiency and resilience to serve our customers and deliver significant growth in revenue and cash flow in 2022 and beyond. These key investments include adding capacity consistent with our Make Where We Sell strategy, co-investing with strategic sourcing partners with a focus on batteries and semiconductors and investing in automation solutions to support productivity, labor efficiency and competitive costs. Our capacity additions are on track, and we have opened 2 new power tool plants and 1 new hand tool facility in North America, which are now ramping up. These new manufacturing plants will enable shorter lead times and be accompanied by parallel regional development of our supply chain base overtime, enhancing local sourcing and speed to market. As it relates to strategic sourcing, we have added new battery suppliers and made co-investments with key partners that have put us in a great position as we enter 2022. We have the necessary battery supply and capacity to support significant growth in tools and to fuel our electrification strategy in outdoor. The supply environment remains tight for semiconductors and electronic components. This plus the elongated global supply chain, which significantly increased inventory in transit, impacted our ability to generate more volume in the fourth quarter. Semiconductor shortages have been a pain point for many global industrials, and we have been investing to improve supply to enable significant tools growth. For example, adding new Tier 2 and 3 suppliers for chips, co-investing with Tier 1 suppliers to improve their capacity and taking actions to lower lead times across our supply base. As mentioned in October, we expect semiconductor supply to improve in Q2 versus current levels. Based on current commitments from our semiconductor suppliers, we expect a 20% to 30% increase in chips in Q2 versus the current run rate. In summary, we have been working to alleviate constraints on many key components and are now down to the last critical few, which will unlock more supply as we move into the second quarter. We are also advancing our Industry 4.0 capabilities, driving automation throughout our manufacturing environment. This will make our U.S. manufacturing plants more competitive, as well as improved productivity in factories across the globe. We just completed a significant flexible automation assembly line in our major U.S. power tool plant. It is up and running. Last year, we also made significant investments in inventory to help meet the outsized demand in the tools business. Excluding the consolidation impact from acquisitions, we increased our core inventory position by $1.8 billion as compared to year-end 2020. Two-thirds of this increase is composed of inputs, work in progress or goods in transit, that will work their way through our supply chain to support growth and improve fill rates with our customers. As a result, fourth quarter free cash flow was $175 million, which brings our year-to-date result to $144 million, significantly below our prior expectation for 2021. The main driver of the deviation was related to the congestion of the global supply chain on working capital. Let me unpack this to provide some additional color. First, we ended up building more inventory and tools versus our expectation. This was primarily related to a combination of goods in transit, expanding in the quarter as we experience port and other logistical delays. The increased tools inventory is needed to serve existing and projected demand, and therefore, we believe we will sell through this incremental inventory during 2022. Secondly, we are holding on to inventory longer than we have historically due to longer shipping and lead times, which has changed the relationship between inventory and payables. This dynamic also led to a deviation versus our October expectations. Finally, the MTD and Excel inventory build ahead of the outdoor season was not in our forecast back in October due to the unknown timing of each of those closings. The global supply chain is dynamic, as we all know, and requires new intensity, focus and agility to react to the changes as well as to be able to predict the dependencies that may be -- may not be consistent with past experiences. We have a long history of using the SBD operating model to drive high asset efficiency, strong cash flow and superior cash flow return on investment. These processes and tools, with some new enhancements, will ensure we mitigate the temporary portion of the inventory increase and the correlated impact to account payables. We will do this while holding the appropriate levels of inventory and making CapEx investments to support the strategic growth initiatives you heard about earlier. We expect to drive working capital efficiency in three primary areas which will increase supply chain predictability, optimize inventory location and improve inventory turns from acquired businesses. One, opportunities will definitely arise as the semiconductor pressure alleviates in Q2 and the electronic component supply improved. Two, we built a dedicated team focused on lowering in-transit inventory. This team will also focus on product SKU optimization of our days of stock, ensuring we have the right inventory when it's needed by our customers. And three, we are also deploying the SBD operating model across our recent acquisitions to drive efficiency in all aspects of working capital. MTD and Excel entered the portfolio around three turns, and we have line of sight to improving that metric across a multiyear period. This management team has dealt with headwinds and temporary shifts in business conditions for two decades plus. And therefore, we are confident that we will improve our turns and believe the cash flow working capital benefit is at least a $500 million opportunity, which is incorporated into our $2 billion cash flow commitment for 2022. In summary, our portfolio and supply chain actions from 2021 have put us in great shape for 2022 and beyond. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the fourth quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 3% revenue growth as the acquisitions of MTD and Excel contributed 7% and price delivered 5 points. These factors were partially offset by a decline of 8% in volume and 1% from currency. Regional organic growth was 7% in the emerging markets with weaker performances in North America and Europe due to, one, a tough comparable related to the prior year holiday shipping timing; two, the current year volume constraints caused by supply chain logistical challenge I previously mentioned; and three, the anticipated Q4 semiconductor shortages we discussed in October. Pricing actions delivered strong mid-single-digit growth in response to commodity inflation and higher cost to serve aligned with expectations. This was the most significant quarterly price benefit the Tools & Storage business has seen in modern history. The operating margin rate for the segment was 11.4%, down versus last year as pricing benefits were more than offset by inflation, higher supply chain costs, growth investments in volume. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as the first quarter of 2022 is currently expected to be the peak of the inflation and supply chain cost headwinds, and then these headwinds will begin to recede versus the prior year. This expected trend in headwinds combined with the pricing actions we completed in 2021, the additional price actions to be completed and implemented in 2022 that I will touch on a little bit later in the call, and the cost controls that we recently put in place will result in profitability rates trending back to normalized levels as we move through 2022 for Tools & Storage. End-user demand strength remains persistent across all markets as the consumer reconnection with the home and garden, innovation, and e-commerce continue to drive growth. Our e-commerce platforms grew over 30% in 2021, the innovation pipeline continues to be impressive with new product launches across the portfolio. In addition to an exciting line of new product introductions in 2022, within the DEWALT, FLEXVOLT, ATOMIC and XTREME power tool platform, and also across the construction, automotive and industrial end markets. Point-of-sale demand in US retail grew high single digits and channel inventory ended below historical levels. We saw strong professional driven demand in the commercial and industrial channels, which grew in the fourth quarter and achieved 28% organic growth in the year. Now turning to the Tools & Storage SBU. Power Tools delivered 20% organic growth in 2021, which was supported by the new and innovative product launches across CRAFTSMAN, DEWALT and STANLEY FATMAX, inclusive of DEWALT POWER STACK, which is off to a fantastic start. Hand tools, accessories and storage achieved full year organic growth of 17%, inclusive of 26% international organic growth, fueled by robust market demand and new product highlights, including the Craftsman trade stack and DEWALT ToughSystem portable storage solutions as well as new additions to the DEWALT Elite Series circular saw blade. Moving to Outdoor Products. This business grew 3% organically in the quarter, while the addition of MTD and Excel added over $200 million of revenue. The outdoor team had a great 2021, achieving 40% organic growth, inclusive of share gain led by electrification. This came from new listings and innovations under the Black + Decker, Craftsman and DEWALT brand. Our acquisitions also had strong innovation-led organic growth for 2021 with new launches such as the redesign Hustler FastTrack zero-turn mower line for commercial use and the first semi-autonomous zero-turn mower with Cub Cadet Share path. We are beginning the journey to integrate our acquisitions into a new $4 billion revenue strategic business unit and are making great strides towards becoming one team focused on innovation, growth and capturing the cost and revenue synergies from these transactions. The collective efforts of our tools and outdoor teams across the globe were unrelenting as they continue to navigate this dynamic operating environment. I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for your perseverance and dedication. Now shifting to Industrial. Quarterly segment revenue declined 7% versus last year, as the three points of price realization were more than offset by 9% volume and 1% currency. Operating margin was 9.3%, down versus last year as the benefits from price and productivity were more than offset by commodity inflation and market driven volume declines in the higher margin automotive and aerospace fastener businesses due to our customers primarily in those markets lowering their production. Looking further within the segment. Engineered Fastening organic revenues were down 9% as strong general industrial growth of 12% was more than offset by aerospace market pressure and lower automotive OEM production, which obviously resulted from the global semiconductor shortage. Our auto fastener business navigated customer production fluctuations and a dynamic market as they move through the year. Despite these external challenges, auto fasteners demonstrated nine points of outperformance versus light vehicle production and the business successfully doubled its revenue tied to electric vehicle production. The business is exceptionally well-positioned for the cyclical rebound in production and for the secular trend of electrification. Our industrial fastener business realized 12% organic growth in the quarter and exit the year with a healthy backlog, which is up nearly 50% versus 2020. It was satisfying to see the business achieve organic growth over 18% in 2021, two times the global industrial production index. While aerospace continued to decline significantly versus prior year, we have started to see green shoots, with revenues sequentially improving for two quarters in a row. This business is focused on capturing the coming rebound in production that will begin in 2022 and continue beyond that. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 3% as 18% growth in attachment tools was largely offset by lower pipeline project activity in oil and gas. Momentum continues to build in the attachment tools market, the strong demand from our OEM and independent dealer customers, generating orders that were up 59% versus the prior year and a backlog that is nearly five times year ending 2020 levels. To summarize our thoughts on Industrial, we saw some pockets of strong growth, combined with early stages of stabilization in the challenged markets I mentioned as we close 2021. And we are looking forward to leveraging the cyclical recovery and to capitalizing on the auto electrification trend over the next two to three years. Turning to the operating environment. We are actively engaged on multiple fronts to support margin recovery and believe headwinds have now stabilized. The 2022 carryover impact inclusive of currency is sized at nearly $800 million. From an input cost and transport rate perspective, we had assumed that the levels seen in the fourth quarter continue for all of 2022. This could be a second half opportunity if recent trends in commodity pricing hold. However, with the continuing dynamic environment, we are not counting on that, and we remain diligent on executing several actions to support margin recovery. We are taking more price actions in the first quarter to offset these headwinds. We are notifying our North American Tools & Outdoor customers this week about new price increases of 5% to 10% or more depending on the category. These actions are in addition to the five points of price already delivered, which underscores that the price environment today is very different from history. Our expectation is 100% coverage of inflation during this cycle. Our 2022 plan now calls for 6% to 7% price, which will be exceeding the carryover cost impact. These actions in aggregate will support sequential margin improvement in the coming quarters and year-over-year margin improvement in the back half of the year. In terms of when price cost turns positive, we still expect that to occur in the middle of the year, as close to 90% of the $800 million of headwinds are estimated to occur in the front half of 2022. Finally, as always, we continue to advance our margin resiliency initiatives and see a pathway to generate $100 million to $150 million of 2022 opportunity. Now before diving into guidance, there's one point that I would like to mention. As a reminder from our release, this guidance does not include the commercial electronic security and health care businesses, which are now recorded as discontinued operations as a result of the announced divestiture in December. Moving to our 2022 guidance on Slide 11. We are planning for total revenue growth in the mid-20s, inclusive of organic growth of 7% to 8% and adjusted earnings per share range of $12, up to $12.50 or increasing approximately 15% to 19% versus 2021. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.10, up to $10.70, inclusive of various one-time charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs, cost reduction and functional transformation initiatives. The current estimate for pre-tax charges is approximately $380 million. From a segment perspective, total Tools & Storage organic growth is expected to be in high single-digits, supported by price, core and breakthrough innovation, continued strong demand across our end markets and the improvement of our customer inventories. The Industrial segment is expected to achieve high single-digit to low double-digit organic growth, driven by new products, pricing, momentum in industrial fasteners and attachment tools and the beginning of a cyclical recovery in auto and aerospace. As it relates to the acquisitions, we believe they will contribute just over $3 billion in revenue in 2022, primarily from MTD and Excel with about 60% of that revenue occurring in the front half. The team is building momentum, and this will be an acquisitive growth driver in 2022, but more importantly, an organic growth driver for years to come. For the full year, it's still our expectation that Tools & Storage will have a strong year-over-year margin expansion on the core, driven by strong second half improvement, as I discussed earlier. Total segment margin will be down as our outdoor acquisitions enter the portfolio with high single-digit profitability. Improving margins from the outdoor acquisition is a focus in 2022 and, of course, beyond. We expect to improve these margins to low double-digits in the one to two-year timeframe and mid-teens in the medium term. For Industrial, the margin rate is expected to expand year-over-year, leveraging strong revenue growth, productivity, and price. Shifting now to the right side of the page, I will outline the drivers of our year-over-year EPS growth at the midpoint. Our plan is to grow our core earnings base with added benefits from the MTD and Excel acquisitions. As we discussed earlier, we are actively addressing the inflationary environment with a 6% to 7% pricing -- set of pricing actions that should allow us to more than fully recover the carryover impact from inflation and the elevated cost to serve, adding $1.20 up to $1.30 of EPS. The carryover impact of our growth investments in SG&A is a headwind of about $0.20 net of our recent cost containment actions. Our outdoor acquisitions are already building momentum and should generate $0.60 of year-over-year benefit, ahead of our prior estimates. We also realized the $0.65 benefit from the 2022 impact of our $4 billion share repurchase program. This is partially offset by tax and other below the line items of $0.55. Our full year tax rate assumption is 10% and we are also planning for increased interest expense due to a higher rate environment and the financing needs of our strategic capital deployment. So, in summary, we expect the business to deliver nearly $1.80 of EPS growth this year to achieve a midpoint of $12.25 of EPS. Now, to cover what this means in terms of the first quarter, which is expected to be about approximately 13.5% of the full year adjusted EPS. We are planning for tools to have a relatively flat organic growth and industrial to decline in the low single-digits, reflecting the tough comp in the automotive business. Acquisitions should contribute about $950 million in revenue as the outdoor season kicks off. Price cost will still be a negative as we experience a significant amount of our full year headwinds in the first quarter. Total company margins should step up from the fourth quarter and in each successive quarter thereafter. We also intend to execute our $2 billion to $2.5 billion of our previously announced $4 billion share repurchase program here in the first quarter. As you think about the quarterly profile for 2022, consider the following factors; one, 90% of our $800 million headwinds occur in the first half of the year; two, the additional pricing actions I mentioned pays into the P&L during the first half; and three, the share repurchase begins to occur in the middle of the first quarter. Therefore, we expect 60% of our annual EPS to be delivered in the second half. For the full year, we expect robust free cash flow generation of $2 billion. This plan considers continued investment in our supply chain, inventory optimization to serve our customers as well as the drawdown of at least $500 million of our working capital, as we previously discussed. We are confident in the steps we have taken and are continuing to take to navigate a dynamic supply environment and optimize our factories. The organization is focused on driving above-market organic growth, delivering on our price and cost control measures, successfully integrating MTD and Excel into the portfolio and leveraging the SBD operating model to improve our working capital efficiency in 2022. We expect executing on these actions, as well as our $4 billion allocation to repurchase shares will deliver 15% to 19% adjusted earnings per share growth and a historic free cash flow performance in 2022. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Don for that immersion into what was a very complicated or complex quarter with a lot of ins and outs in the portfolio and lots of dynamics in the end markets and so on. So thanks for taking the time and really giving a very transparent view there. And so as you've seen and heard, we are focused on continuing to serve the robust demand in our markets. Our multiyear runway for growth is compelling. We talked about adding $2.5 billion of growth in 2021 and then another $4-plus billion in 2022.  Our EPS and revenue set records in last year, and we expect more of the same this year. So, we're determined that free cash flow will return to record levels in 2022 as the working capital reverts back to a source of cash. And we're confident in our ability to execute in today's dynamic, volatile environment. Our proven track record of performance over many years supports this. Our 6-year revenue and EPS CAGRs, our 6% for revenue, 10% for EPS, respectively, and a new and improved portfolio and a great strategic setup for 2022 and beyond. We're focused on several tactical operational levers to ensure outstanding near-term execution. First, we're leveraging our price productivity and cost control measures to support a margin rebound throughout the year as Don described that. We're well positioned to achieve price covering the entire $1.4 billion of inflation and cost to serve for the 2-year period 2021, 2022. The unusual cost input increases have stabilized for now, and we are monitoring trends closely to ensure that we respond to trend changes as they develop. We're investing in the supply chain to ensure that we have the necessary capacity and supply to fulfill the strong demand and support significant revenue growth this year and beyond. We're off to a good start integrating the outdoor acquisitions, which are positioned to contribute EPS accretion of $0.85 in total, $0.65 year-over-year and $0.20 ahead of our initial expectations. We're driving working capital reductions, which we expect to translate to an impressive cash flow performance in 2022. And lastly, we're expecting to execute on our $4 billion share repurchase program very, very soon. So I'm confident in our collective ability to deliver another strong year in 2022 with outstanding potential for value creation. With that, Dennis, we are now ready for Q&A.
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. 
Julian Mitchell: Hi good morning. A lot of good detail in the slides. Maybe 1 point I wanted to home in on was on the Tools volume side of things. I think it sounds like you're assuming that tools volumes organically at least down maybe mid-high single digit in Q1 after backing out price, so, not too different from the trend year-on-year in Q4. Just wanted to check that that's the case. And then maybe as you think about the balance of the year after Q1, there's clearly a lot going on with people trying to figure out the impact of interest rate increases, maybe we start to see some volume headwind from continuously rising prices. So how conservative do you think your tools volume guide is for the year? I think you're assuming volumes are maybe flattish or down a bit in tools for 2022 overall and down more than that in Q1?
Don Allan: Yeah. I think, Julian, that's a good assessment of where we think we are with the tools and outdoor businesses from a core perspective, obviously, on an organic basis. So we – for the year, we're probably looking at a relatively flat volume performance, with a very strong price performance of 6% to 7%, so they're probably leaning closer to 7%. The Q1 dynamic will be volume probably down 4 or 5 points in the first quarter, and then improvement of that kind of modestly as the year goes on. No real big significant volume expectation in any given quarter at this stage. However, we do see that as an interesting opportunity. I mean, there is a lot of uncertainty to your point about where demand may go, what may happen based on all these inflationary pressures and the prices going into the marketplace. So we think we're well positioned by taking the approach we're taking on the price side. But we also see an opportunity that, if demand is strong, we've adjusted our supply chain to be prepared for that and in particular by Q2 on the semiconductor side. And so if demand is there, we'll be able to really meet that demand and improve the fill rates of our customers as well as the inventory levels in the store.
Jim Loree: Yeah. The flattish volume is really more of a financial planning construct than it is in operational execution plan. So we are going for as much volume as makes sense and as much as double-digit volume in terms of what we're programming to try to achieve. However, given the uncertainty in the macro, given what remains to be seen in terms of price elasticity of demand for the products, we're trying to be financially conservative here so that, if any of the types of things that I described become factors that we still have a financial plan that makes a lot of sense.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning. Maybe to pick up on that point, right? You delivered what you delivered in 2021 with the semiconductor situation as it was. So Jim, I think you're then implying that with what we heard today on the call about semiconductors, there actually is an opportunity to kind of uncork more volume. I just wonder, if that's kind of the linchpin of the whole kind of volume debate in 2022 and if there are any other particular really pinch points or bottlenecks that you need to work through?
Jim Loree: Yeah. Come April, I think we're going to be in a position to really open up that well. So it really is a couple of months of constrained production based on that. And then whatever we can get after that, we've got really good supply definitely enough to support double-digit organic growth beyond that. And of course, the other potential constraint, but it's not going to be an issue for us, would be battery cells, and we've got that one under control with investments that we've made in capacity with major battery suppliers. So, we have the capability come April to open the spigot for volume and produce whatever the market demands.
Operator: Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Your line is open.
Markus Mittermaier: Yes, hi. Good morning. Maybe another one on pricing from my side, the 6% to 7%. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the various go-to-market channels you have? Has anything changed in your ability to price with the higher proportion of the online business, B2C or the addition of some of the other end markets that you're now going after? How has pricing changed to maybe what we know from the prior cycle?
Don Allan: Well, I think, Markus, the way to think about it is there is really no cycle in history that you can really compare this to. I mean maybe you could go back to the 1970s and the inflationary periods back then. But the world clearly was much different and e-commerce didn't even exist back in the 1970s. So, it's a very different timeframe. And so when you look at this situation where you're dealing with $1.4 billion of headwinds at Stanley Black & Decker, we put a significant amount of price in the market in 2021. We have not seen an impact to demand related to that in any of the channels that you referenced. We're putting more, as I mentioned, price increases in the market here in the first quarter of 2022, anywhere ranging from 5% to 10%, depending on the product family or category, in some cases, even higher than that if we see significant gaps versus our competitors or we see a situation where a particular product is being impacted more heavily by the commodity inflation headwinds. So, we'll watch this very closely. I mean it's why we're taking this approach on the volume side where we're not being overly aggressive in forecasting where the volume might go. But we're prepared, as Jim and I both mentioned, to really pursue higher volume. But we have to watch the pricing impact very closely and see the elasticity impact, but it's different. It's a different cycle. This is not the typical cycle where you're looking at maybe putting 3% to 4% price increase in the market to offset your inflationary pressures. You're talking about something that's more above 10% in many cases. And if you look at our peers and other players in both the building products and industrial space, you're seeing the magnitude of those types of increases across the Board. And we believe that's the right approach at this stage. However, we also have to maintain the flexibility and watch this very closely day-to-day and week-to-week and respond accordingly.
Jim Loree: There's an existence theorem for this type of environment, not so much the supply-constrained part of it, but the highly inflationary environment in some of the developing markets. So, for instance, Latin America, which often has massive inflation that comes quickly and often is currency-driven. But in those markets, our history of being able to recover price is excellent, our history of being able to stabilize margins at favorable rates is very good. And the continuation of organic growth and strong organic growth in those markets is something that we've been able to sustain for a long period of time. So if this is -- if this environment response is anything like what we've seen in some of those types of situations, the demand continues. So we don't know as Don said, it's uncharted territory. But we're ready for anything, as Don said.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. 
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hey good morning, guys. So just a follow up on the price discussion. I think, Don, you mentioned maybe some potential upside from commodities as some of those roll off. How much of the price equation is really tied to something surcharge related where maybe you give some of that back, or I guess, maybe said differently, what are the surcharges tied to in terms of like price benchmarking? And then I guess sort of related, how would you rate your price capture POS relative to what you've seen out of peers? Do you think you're ahead, behind? Some aspect of the competitive environment would be helpful?
Don Allan: Yes, I think the surcharge component is probably a couple of points of price that we put in place in the fourth quarter. And it was really more heavily tied to the cost to serve aspect. And so, we had these -- as we all experienced this really intense wave of price increases in logistical space transportation in the summer of 2021 and going into the fall, and that surcharge is really in response to that. Those prices on container costs and other logistic costs have not really changed. They dipped down a little bit in the month of December, but then they pop back up to the previous levels in January. So I don't -- we don't really see any significant shifts in that particular area. And I think the supply chain could continue to be a little bit challenging from a cost perspective for a portion of this year. What I was referring to is more on certain commodities are shipping in the last month or 2, where you're seeing steel pull back a little bit and a couple of other commodities as well. Right now, that if those prices held, that could be a $50 million to $100 million opportunity for us later in the year. So that's kind of the sense of the magnitude. It's not a massive move at this stage. If it continued to improve, and obviously, that number could get better. So we're not seeing shifts that have us concerned about the pricing actions we've taken nor the pricing actions we plan to take here in the first quarter. But again, that will be something we closely monitor. And we also have to keep in mind that we – it takes a while to get price actions into many of our customers, and you saw that in 2021 play out. And so we're probably a 3 to 6 month lag versus what you might see in some industrial channels versus the building product channels that we're more heavily weighted to. And as a result, you're probably going to have an upside tail on the back end of this as things start to change. And so that's just something to keep in mind as you think about price, where if you compare it to an industrial peer who may have had priced much quicker in 2021 and price may move down sooner in 2022. The dynamic here will be different just because of what I laid out related to the lag and how it really plays out in the building product space.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. You mentioned price elasticity now a couple of times. I'm just wondering if you've seen any signs of that. The POS is strong, but just wondering if you've seen any early signs of that. And it feels like you're prepared to trade lower volumes for higher price. I just want to make sure that's the case. But my real question is, could we just get a bit more definition on how we see the Tools & Storage margins playing out through the year sequentially? It seems like we're starting up at comparable levels to what we saw in 4Q how do we see that building up through the year? Thanks.
Jim Loree: I mean in a perfect world, Nigel, we would want to get our margins back to what they've been historically, and we would want to grow with the market and then in excess of the market, gaining share with our product development and our – all the other growth catalysts that we have. That's what we're aiming to do. Now I've said – I've mentioned price elasticity, because it's a reality of any pricing environment is such that at some point, there is a change in the consumer's willingness to purchase something at a given price, and there's a lot of different economic factors that consumers are dealing with right now. And so that's just an unknown. And it's not something that we're prepared – we're not necessarily prepared to trade volume. Let me put it this way, we're not necessarily prepared to trade market share for price. And we will continue to grow our market share. And so we just need to continue to monitor price elasticity, competitive dynamics, all those different things that one does when one manages in an environment like this.
Don Allan: And you mentioned margins and profitability and tools, Nigel. And so as you saw, we had 11.4% in the fourth quarter operating margin for the Tools & Outdoor segment. I think the first quarter will be kind of in that ballpark, maybe a little bit better than that number. Then you see a fairly substantial jump in Q2 and in the back half. We're getting pretty close to that 18% number, in particular in the fourth quarter. So it's going to be a gradual improvement in operating margin rates with a bit of a pretty sluggish start in the first quarter because of the fact, as I mentioned. The fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 is really the peak periods for the headwinds. And so you're seeing pretty substantial headwinds in both those quarters, and then they start to recede going forward after that. So that's just something to keep in mind as you factor in your modeling.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Mike Rehaut: Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Just to make sure – and apologies, if we're beating a dead horse here, but in terms of where you were on last quarter's earnings call, where you're expecting, I believe, mid-single-digit volume growth, and now for Tools & Storage, flattish. I just want to kind of break down the differences between then and now in terms of the expectations. How much is coming from maybe supply chain constraints, which I think you've said you expect to more fully address in the second quarter and going forward versus conservatism from the price increases and that impact on volume in terms of demand elasticity. Just trying to understand where the differences come from. And if there's any other elements that's driving that change in terms of the end market demand for instance. And then secondly, on the price – the price increases of 6% to 7% company-wide if that is – we could think about that kind of a similar impact in terms of against Tools & Outdoor and industrial if it's a similar type of allocation. Thanks.
Don Allan: Yes. So, Michael, I would say that as you think about what we said in October, obviously, we weren't providing guidance or just kind of giving a high-level framework. And -- but as we progress through the fourth quarter and began to finalize and create our guidance for the full year here in January, I guess, now February, we really recognize that there was a pursuing those actions here in the first quarter of 2022. 5% does not get us to where our margins should be, along the lines that Jim described and I described a few minutes ago. And so we really believe we need to take that approach, and that is the right approach. On the volume side, I would say that there's a little bit of the supply constraint dragging over into Q1 for sure. And so we had an expectation of a little bit better performance in Q1 back in October. But given the dynamics that played out during the -- especially November, December, we think the more prudent view of the approach we're taking with the Tools & Storage organic growth in Q1. And then your question on the 6% to 7%, was that more about, Dennis, more about the split between tools and outdoor? What was some?
Dennis Lange: Yes. So, both segments -- no, tools and industrial.
Don Allan: Tools & Industrial. 
Dennis Lange: Yes, I think it's actually when you look at both of those, they are both going after pretty aggressive price actions and there's not a big deviation between the two of them.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe O’Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Joe O’Dea: Hi, good morning. It seems like there's a big step up in earnings expected from one 1Q to 2Q and I'm assuming that that's related to the supply chain side of things and you've talked about April getting better, but I wonder if you can just expand on the visibility you have into that because I think you're putting a finer point on it than others in terms of the timing of some of the supply chain getting better. But just how secure that is at this point for the visibility it gives you?
Don Allan: Well, I think when you look at the dynamics of that kind of walk, you obviously have a volume improvement. That's pretty substantial for the reasons that you just touched on around supply chain and semiconductors. You'll see more price flowing through in the second quarter versus the first quarter because of the actions that we're now taking here in Q1. You'll get a bigger benefit in Q2. There's some cost containment actions we've touched on that you get a full quarter benefit of that in Q2 as well. So, -- and then, obviously, some of the headwinds start to level out and recede a little bit versus the prior years. So, all those things together are really driving that improvements from Q1 to Q2. What I would say volume and price being the larger components of those items.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Everyone, have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker’s 2021 third quarter conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, CEO; Don Allan, President and CFO; and Lee McChesney, Vice President of Corporate Finance and CFO of Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we'll refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11:00 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Lee will review our 2021 third quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Loree.
Jim Loree: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning everyone. This morning, we announced a record third quarter, which was powered by 11% growth, primarily result of an impressive 10% organic growth performance. Customer demand remained at robust levels across commercial and retail end markets and strong trends continued in home building and remodeling, commercial construction, professional activity, and global economic growth. Innovation was also a positive, which is driving demand around electrification and other themes. We're continuing to prioritize meeting this heightened customer demand while operating in an unusually complex supply chain environment. I thank our 56,000 employees around the world for delivering record revenue under the circumstances. And in particular, I want to offer a special thanks to our employee makers in plants, DCs and operations organizations, as well as our sales and service people for their incredible dedication, agility, and resilience to serve our customers during this period, as they always do. Tools generated 13% organic growth in what we believe to be the strongest demand environment in our history, resulting from positive secular trends, robust professional activity and strong global markets. Our brands such as DEWALT, Craftsman, Stanley, and Black & Decker among others were fueled by a steady stream of innovation and a strong and resilient supply chain, which is putting great products in the hands of our loyal end users across the globe. Industrial grew 1% organically driven by continued double-digit growth and share gains in our general, industrial and attachment tool businesses. As these end markets remained solid. Industrial growth was tempered however, by lower auto production activity, as OEMs continue to be impacted by electronic and other component shortages. Aerospace also experienced trough conditions as the industry recovery while promising to be likely in the foreseeable future has yet to occur. Security delivered another strong quarter with 8% organic growth, the security transformation to a data enabled cloud-based technology provider is building significant momentum. And our team successfully converted this robust backlog into revenue growth. Order rates were strong and we posted the third straight record quarter and backlog. We're excited about the full potential of these opportunities to support elevated revenue growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. The overall company adjusted operating margin rate was 12.2% down from the prior year as growth investments and higher supply chain costs that accelerated in the quarter, more than offset volume, leverage, price, mixed benefits and margin resiliency. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.77 down 4% year-over-year. And similar to most companies engaged in global trade, our supply chain costs were higher this quarter. We have worked tirelessly to get components and finished products to where they need to be to serve this extraordinary customer demand. Through data analytics, we now have visibility into every container on and off the water and we utilize this visibility to prioritize and expedite the most critical items often with premium freight. To offset the additional expenses, we have deployed price increases, surcharges and productivity measures. To be clear, we have made a conscious decision to incur temporarily higher expediting costs to serve our customers and meet demand as effectively as possible. We have sized the pricing and productivity actions to ensure that we are well positioned to address the inflation and achieve margin accretion in 2022. This implies that our actions will be sufficient to restore our margins to normalize levels as the actions catch up to the higher costs in 2022. And further, we remain highly confident in our multi-year growth and margin expansion plans. There are several positive secular demand trends that are benefiting our businesses, and we remain bullish on the resi and non-resi construction markets. As well as the industrial recovery, we have developed an array of growth drivers to position our businesses to capture this opportunity. And we are continuing to invest in innovation, manufacturing, automation, inventory, and our supply chain to meet the strong demand in the near-term and fuel sustainable growth over the medium and long-term. And now I'll take a moment to review our recently announced MTD and Excel acquisitions. The combination of these two high quality complimentary companies with our existing outdoor business creates a powerful growth engine with approximately $4 billion of revenue across all categories and channels in the $25 billion plus outdoor category. Of the $4 billion, we expect approximately $3 billion of the $4 billion to be a direct result of closing the two transactions in the coming weeks. Even before that, we are starting from a position of strength with strong outdoor brands in DEWALT, Craftsman, and Black & Decker, as well as the fastest growing franchise in cordless electric outdoor products. Our legacy outdoor business is benefiting from the long-term trend of electrification, primarily now in handheld products and walk behind mowers. MTD is one of the leading players in U.S. retail with great brands, such as Cub Cadet and Troy-Bilt and brings a relentless dedication to innovation. Excel focuses on zero-turn mowers and offers a range of premier commercial grade and prosumer equipment with Tier 1 niche pro-brands, such as Hustler and BigDog. Excel also brings us access to a strong and extensive professional dealer network. These acquisitions are complimentary to each other and fill gaps in our current presence in the outdoor space, which brings me to another major growth driver. With these acquisitions, we have an ESG opportunity to lead large format electrification and outdoor, the customer adoption of electrified riders and zero-turn mowers is still in the early stages, but the future potential is compelling. In collaboration with MTD, we have been making great progress since 2019 in developing innovative electrified solutions that offer a compelling value proposition in terms of runtime, price point and environmental impact. Additionally, MTD has semi-autonomous and autonomous mowing technology, which we will commercialize in the coming years. Outdoor will undoubtedly unleash an array of impressive innovation over the next few years. Global channel development and professional branding are significant additional revenue synergies that we think as we think about ways to grow sales through our future outdoor activities, applying MTD strong innovation with a leading professional brand, like DEWALT presents an excellent opportunity to win the pro-user with a full lineup of gas and electric options. To fully realize its potential, we plan to build on our existing position in retail, as well as expand our sales in the pro-dealer network. MTD has a strong presence in the retail channel with approximately 1,500 dealer locations. Excel exclusively distributes through its 1,400 outlet dealer channel, which is largely geographically complimentary to MTD’s dealers. The opportunities for brand, product and channel revenue synergies to expand sales and carry accretive margins are both meaningful and exciting. And finally, on one more outdoor growth front, we have an opportunity in the $4 billion high margin parts service segment as we build our presence and serve our customers. The benefits from this growth will also come with margin expansion. As we apply our SPD operating model and our global scale to execute on cost synergies, launch margin accretive innovation and develop a vibrant professional franchise. We expect these opportunities to provide a pathway to mid-teens or higher margins over the long-term. Both acquisitions are currently progressing through their respective regulatory processes. And for MTD, we are happy to say that the United States HSR review is complete. Additional reviews are underway in several other smaller countries. We currently anticipate a close in late 2021 or early 2022 for both transactions pending successful completion of the regulatory processes. And as must be obvious, we're excited about the future of outdoor products at SPD, the significant ESG growth and margin opportunities have the potential for excellent value creation in 2022 and beyond. Extreme innovation is at the heart of SPD’s culture. It is one of our three strategic pillars, performance, innovation and social responsibility. Innovation differentiates all our franchises and defines our brands. Over the last couple of years, we have brought incredible innovation to the market from flexible to atomic and extreme, and now DEWALT POWERSTACK and Black & Decker reviva, which I will cover in a few moments. It is clear that our tools innovation machine has never been stronger. Nonetheless, we are doubling down on our investments in innovation and new product commercialization. These investments will support the largest pipeline we have ever had with new products across all our major categories and end users. Over the last 12 months, we have added approximately 1,300 new employees with deep domain expertise and technical knowledge in critical areas, including sales, engineering, product management, brand, industrial design, e-commerce and end user insights. Our supply chain investments are also key innovation enablers moving closer to the customer, adding capacity, improves agility, customer responsiveness, and speed to market as we develop and commercialize new products. We have approximately $200 million of new innovation and growth investment projects in process, which are included in our second half 2021 run rate. These projects will allow us to effectively better serve the strong global product demand for Tools and position us for sustained long-term growth. Earlier this month, we announced our latest breakthrough innovation, the DEWALT POWERSTACK battery, a remarkable design and engineering achievement. POWERSTACK is the world's first power tool battery to leverage lithium-ion pouch cell technology and introduces a new era of performance for DEWALT power tools. POWERSTACK batteries will begin shipping in the fourth quarter of this year with annual growth potential measured in hundreds of millions. This is another example of our leading edge, differentiated innovation driving the revenue growth potential of our core business. The POWERSTACK battery is 25% smaller, 15% lighter than our comparable DEWALT 20-volt 2 ampere hour battery and it delivers 50% more power with two times the charge cycles making this revolutionary design, the lightest and most powerful and longest lasting compact battery from DEWALT. And it is compatible with our DEWALT 20-volt system. The combination of POWERSTACK and our proven capabilities to design and manufacture the best and most compact brushless motors in the industry. We have just unlocked a new dimension for smaller, lighter and more powerful tools with enormous runway ahead. The importance of this innovation cannot be overstated, more power, more compact, lighter, last longer, guaranteed tough. We love it and so will the market. DEWALT is again asserting itself as the industry leader in professional power tools. And now for something also very exciting, but quite different. It's never been more important for companies to turn their attention to building a sustainable future for our global community. The Black & Decker reviva line is our latest customer offering in creating more sustainable products and driving innovation with purpose. This line of consumers, DIY tools features 50% post-consumer recycled content in the enclosures, which reduces virgin plastic use and supports closing the loop in a circular economy. Partnering with Eastman to apply their Tritan Renew material to our products has created the opportunity to reduce environmental impact, while continuing to develop the performance durability and quality that our customers require. We are delighted to have found a long-term partner in Eastman, a company that will support and accelerate our wider, broader commitment to becoming a force for good in society. This product is a great example of how corporations can embrace ESG in a way that provides meaningful innovation to the consumer, reduces our impact on the environment and drives business performance. The Black & Decker revitalization is a major growth opportunity for the company. And reviva is just one great example of how we're making that happen. And now I will turn it over to Don to talk about our supply chain investments, our business segment results and how we are positioning the company for sustained long-term growth. Don?
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. As Jim just highlighted in his opening remarks, we continue to see a range of powerful secular business drivers that are creating a path for strong multi-year growth for our businesses. In support of that, I want to spend a moment to share a few of the many actions we have taken to position our company for significant growth in 2022 and beyond. Three areas I would like to highlight include our latest investments in expanded manufacturing capacity, strategic sourcing partnerships and the further acceleration of our factory automation initiatives. Beginning with our manufacturing footprint. We are aligning our new investments with our Make Where We Sell strategy as we expand capacity globally. For example in 2021, we are opening two new power tool plants, and one new hand tool facility in North America. These three new facilities will enable shorter lead times and once in place our North American capacity will have tripled since 2016. These new manufacturing plants will be accompanied by a parallel regional development of our local supply chain base over time, enhancing local market sourcing and speed to market. As it relates to strategic sourcing, we have acted and continue to focus on securing sufficient supply of battery cells and electronic components used in our power tools to support our long term growth plans, which include the growing tailwind from electrification. We have co-invested with key battery suppliers to secure dedicated capacity for the next several years. In addition, we are adding new qualified suppliers to diversify our sourcing and working to increase our inventories for battery cells. We made great progress in 2021 and are well positioned for significant supply increases related to battery cells. As it relates to electronic components, we are following a very similar plan. We have made progress in 2021 and are on our way to securing the chips and the throughput to support at least 25% growth in our electronic component supply for 2022. This area is currently an intense pain point. However, we see a roadmap for significant improvement by early spring of 2022. Finally, we are leveraging our Industry 4.0 capabilities to drive manufacturing automation throughout many of our factories. We are deploying multiple projects in our Charlotte manufacturing facility that have a payback of less than one year. These flexible automation projects enable to labor efficiency and increase throughput required to deliver outsized productivity and enable our Make Where We Sell strategy. In summary, we have positioned our business to have the capacity, supply and throughput to deliver significant growth in 2022 and beyond. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the third quarter. Tools and stores delivered record revenues as we maintained our focus on ensuring, we keep up with the existing market demands. This resulted in 14% revenue growth with volume up 11%, price up 2% and currency contributing an additional point. The operating margin rate for the segment was 15.7% down from 21.5% in the third quarter of last year. As volume, price, productivity and benefits from innovation were more than offset by accelerating transit costs incurred to meet the strong market demand. Additionally, rising commodity inflation and new growth investments related to digital marketing and feed on the street offset those positive items I mentioned. All regions delivered organic growth with North America up 9%, Europe up 20% and emerging markets up 28%. This performance was supported across all markets as the secular shifts related to the reconnection with the home and garden, as well as e-commerce were amplified by our industry leading innovation and the strong professional demand. The high single digit North American growth was underpinned by another strong retail performance up 6%, as point of sale demand remained at robust levels in U.S. retail and channel inventory remained below historical levels. The strong professional driven demand was also demonstrated in the commercial and industrial channels posting 15% growth versus the prior year. Our thesis on demand is playing out as underlying construction activity remained strong and the pro is driving growth. Overcoming a robust growth performance in the comparable period last year and a little bit of moderation in the DIY category. Further demonstrating the durability of these trends, our latest POS results showed mid single digit growth over the last four weeks covering late September through mid-October, with the last measured week up double digits, a very good signal of the healthy backdrop in U.S. retail. The European Tools business experienced growth across all major geographies, along with the commercial, retail brick-and-mortar and ecommerce channels. The region grew 17% organically with a standout ecommerce outperformance up 43% versus the prior year in addition to a notable DEWALT brand strength performance, which achieved 27% growth. Finally in emerging markets growth was pervasive across all regions and was led by trade solutions, cordless power tools and continued ecommerce momentum. All markets are consistently contributing to share gains, including 36% organic growth in Latin America and 22% organic growth in Asia. Finally, our enterprise-wide ecommerce strategic growth initiative continues to deliver strong results. With third quarter global ecommerce revenue up nearly 20% versus 2020. Now, let's turn to the tools and storage SKUs. Power tools delivered 11% organic growth, which was support by the new and innovative product launches across CRAFTSMAN, DEWALT and STANLEY FATMAX. Two great examples of these innovations are one STANLEY 20-volt product line launch with improved battery technology and two, several new offerings across both the extreme and atomic platforms. Moving on to the outdoor business. All regions contributed to an 11% organic growth performance. This was driven by new listings and cordless innovations under the Black & Decker Craftsman and DEWALT brands. Notably, global sales were up over 50% year-to-date as compared to 2020. We delivered industry leading growth rollout new offerings and mowers and handheld products in 2021. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the results of our 2022 line reviews, where we gain significant listings with all our major retailers, supporting our beliefs that outdoor electrification has the potential to be a major growth catalyst for the company. Finally, hand tools accessories and storage grew 16% organically fueled by a robust market demand and new product introductions across our key construction auto and industrial markets. A few highlights include the 20-volt spot laser and the elite circular sawblade within the construction space. Within the automotive aftermarket CRAFTSMAN unveiled a new set of V Series mechanics tools that are designed to professional specifications. We also launched a LENOX GEN-TECH carbide bandsaw for our industrial customers. A lot of wonderful innovation in the third quarter. Also during the quarter, the tools and storage team was awarded 46 Pro Tool Innovation Awards, representing best-in-class products in the construction industry. Well done tools team. I want to thank all the tools and storage employees around the world for their perseverance to navigate this dynamic environment to deliver a fantastic revenue result for the quarter. Demand in tools remains robust lapping strong 2020 growth comps and Q3 saw strong mid 20’s percentile growth as compared to 2019. Now shifting to industrial. Segment revenue expanded by 1%, as 2 points of price and 1 point of currency was partially offset by 1 point of volume and 1 point from an oil and gas product line divestiture. Operating margin was 7.9% down versus 12.3% in the third quarter of last year, as the benefits from price and productivity were more than offset by commodity inflation, growth investments and volume declines in higher margin automotive and aerospace fasteners. Looking further within this segment, engineered fastening organic revenues were down 1% as strong general industrial growth of 23% was offset by market driven aerospace declines and lower automotive OEM production, resulting from the global semiconductor shortage. Our auto fastener growth outperformed light vehicle production by approximately 15 points for the quarter and year-to-date periods. This shows our value add business model is generating share gains, despite the OEM production schedule fluctuations. Infrastructure organic revenues were up 7%, as 16% growth in attachment tools was partially offset by lower pipeline project activity in oil and gas. Momentum continues to build in the attachment tools markets with strong backlogs and order rates at our OEM and independent dealer customers. As we look forward into 2022 and beyond, we are prepared to serve the cyclical growth recovery across many of our industrial end markets. Now shifting to security. Total revenue was up 5% with 7% volume and 1 point contributions from price, currency and acquisitions, which was partially offset by a 5 point decline related to the international divestitures completed in the third quarter of last year. North America was up 12% organically driven by strong backlog conversion and commercial electronic security and solid growth within automatic doors and healthcare. Europe was positive organically led by data driven product solutions in France, which is one of our most mature businesses in activating the new health and safety growth opportunities that we have outlined in the past. Our security business transformation is consistently driving top-line momentum. Order rates globally grew 14% in the third quarter resulting in the third consecutive record quarter-end backlog. Overall security segment profit rate, excluding charges was 9.2% down versus the priority year rate of 11%, as price and volume gains were more than offset by higher labor costs, pandemic related inefficiencies and growth investments such as SaaS solutions, touchless door technology, and other health and safety options. We now have broad customer access, but new safety protocols are extending installation timelines. We are implementing price actions for these new realities while we continue to invest to fuel top line momentum. I will now turn the call to Lee McChesney who will review cash flow and provide an update on our response to the rising costs in key areas of our supply chain. Lee?
Lee McChesney: Thank you, Don. Moving to Slide 11, let's review free cash flow performance. Third quarter free cash flow was a use of cash of $125 million, which brings our year-to-date results to a use of cash of $31 million. As you heard from Jim, we are focused on serving our customers and have invested in inventory to serve the robust demand environment here in 2021 and in 2022 and beyond, which is a major item that explains a year-over-year performance. There's also normal seasonality pattern to our working capital that typically results in a significant amount of our cash flow generation occurring in the fourth quarter. We expect 2021 will follow that pattern and are planning for strong fourth quarter cash performance. While ensuring that we make the appropriate investments in inventory and CapEx to support all of our exciting growth initiatives. Let's now move to Page 12 and dive into the supply chain. The environment certainly remains dynamic as we serve the robust demand across the markets. During the third quarter, we experienced accelerated input cost inflation and higher cost to serve demand. We've initiated a comprehensive set of pricing and productivity actions in response. I'll now outline our latest expectations for inflation and our game plan for price recovery. Compared to our July guidance, key commodity inputs, such as steel resins and purchase components accelerated throughout the third quarter, contributing an incremental $100 million in costs. In addition, container and transportation costs, which largely drive our cost to serve experienced a dramatic increase during the quarter. Average container spot prices are now nearly seven times what we were paying earlier this year. Average transit time from Asian suppliers to the North American manufacturing facilities and distribution centers have increased more than twofold from approximately 40 days to 85. Combined, these container and transit cost impacts added an additional $130 million of cost pressure. These underlying assumptions raise our full year commodity and supply chain headwinds to an estimate of approximately $690 million, assuming that known impacts continue. We also are forecasting approximately $600 million to $650 million of carryover cost headwinds for 2022. Now, if you shift to the right side of the page teams across the globe are actively engaged to fully address these headwinds with robust productivity actions to further boost their operational efficiency. We've also completed the price increases that we discussed with you in July and have recently taken further actions, which include communicating a new 5% surcharge in our North America tools and outdoor business, and further price increases across all of our businesses and regions during the fourth quarter. The combination of our market leading brands, when coupled with our robust pipeline for innovation provide the setup for volume and price driven growth in 2022. And then finally, we continue to advance our margin resiliency initiatives and anticipate $100 million to $150 million of opportunity in 2022, which we can leverage to offset incremental headwinds, further invest in the business or contribute to margin outperformance. Within a complex environment, we believe that we've sized the productivity and pricing actions to exceed the anticipated 2022 headwinds. And we are taking the appropriate actions to position the business for margin improvement in the coming quarters. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Don to review guidance.
Don Allan: Thanks, Lee. I will now outline the full year organic growth and margin rate assumptions overall and by segments. Our updated full year 2021 guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 17%, and at the midpoint adjusted EPS expansion of 22% versus the prior year and 31% versus 2019. Tools and Storage and security organic growth expectations are consistent with our prior guidance in the low 20s and the high single digits respectively. The teams will continue to leverage price and cost actions in addition to operational productivity to counteract the extremely dynamic supply chain cost pressures. We are anticipating a relatively consistent level of revenue for Tools and Storage across Q3 and Q4, which both represent total growth in the mid to high 20s versus the comparable periods in 2019. Across all the segments margin rates will be down year-over-year, largely due to the accelerated inflation impacts, which are partially mitigated by the incremental pricing actions that were or will be implemented during the third and fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.20, up to $10.45 inclusive of various one time charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, we are moderating the EPS outlook to $10.90, up to $11.10 from the previous range of $11.35 to $11.65. The key assumption changes to the company's prior EPS outlook includes the following four items. One, an incremental $230 million in commodity, transit and labor inflation, which is approximately a $1.25 reduction into EPS. Two, recent currency movements have resulted in a $0.15 negative EPS for 2021. Three, these pressures will be partially mitigated by our incremental pricing actions and other actions, which add an incremental $0.30 EPS. And then four, the benefit of a lower full year tax rate and other below the line assumption will contribute approximately $0.60 of improvement in EPS. We have also disclosed several key full year assumptions and our expectation for pre-tax M&A and other charges to assist you with your modeling. Lastly, the company expects free cash flow to be approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which contemplates CapEx investment levels to be between 3% to 3.5% of revenue. This updated guidance reflects our desire to maintain temporarily higher levels of inventory to serve the strong demand and improve customer fill rates. That combined with our supply chain investments will set up – set us up strong for very strong performance in 2022. So in summary, our revised guidance calls for consistent revenue expectations generating organic growth of 16% to 17% and approximately 22% adjusted EPS expansion for the company in 2021. Considering the volatility in the operating environment that we all continue to navigate, this is an excellent top-line performance with significant year-over-year EPS expansion. Moving to the right side of the page. I'll now outline some initial thoughts on 2022. While the environment remains dynamic, we have strong conviction that we can grow our core earnings base in addition to the MTD and Excel accretion. We have been investing in our supply chain and in a powerful set of organic growth initiatives that can fuel mid-single digit organic volume growth in 2022. In addition, we have cost productivity to help us fund investments and enable healthy operating leverage. We are also actively addressing the inflationary environment with pricing actions that should result in 3.5 to four points of price next year, and will allow us to move to more than fully recover to carryover impacts from inflation experience in the second half of 2021. We believe this price and inflation dynamic can be a positive carryover benefit of approximately $0.20 of EPS in 2022. These factors added together should generate approximately $0.90 to $1.10 of EPS accretion. Additionally, MTD and Excel is expected to generate $0.50 of EPS and combined with the prior factors can result in significant double digit EPS growth from operations. Below the line, we are assuming a $0.50 headwind primarily from the tax benefit in 2021, which will not repeat next year. So to summarize with the current inflation and demand environment, we are programming the business to deliver $1 of EPS growth versus our 2021 guidance. Tools and security global markets continue to demonstrate strong demand and our customers have an optimistic view for 2022. Industrial begin to see a cyclical recover in 2022, most likely at a moderate place. We have a clear plan for 2022 growth assuming that conditions we are experiencing today continue. These initial thoughts on what is possible in 2022 will be refined with our guidance to be issued in January once we have a clearer picture of various external inputs. That being said, the market demand environment remains very strong and supportive. We have a phenomenal set of growth catalysts across the businesses, and we are actively addressing the supply and inflation environment, which has not worsened from what we have experienced in Q3. We remain well positioned to deliver above market organic growth with operating leverage, resulting a strong free cash generation that will drive top quartile shareholder returns over the long term. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim?
Jim Loree: Thank you, Don. What may not be obvious without stepping back from all this condensed information is this? When we deliver the organic growth in 2022 that Don discussed, and when we close the outdoor transactions. In combination, we will have added $6 billion of growth in the 2021, 2022 time period against a 2020 base of $14 billion that is over 40% growth. So in summary, we continue to execute on the strong demand trends and deliver exceptional organic growth, despite the temporarily challenging supply chain environment. We are enjoying positive secular trends, vibrant markets in a strong array of growth catalysts. And we expect this to continue. I am more than pleased with our team's efforts, and I'm excited about the enormous potential as we close up this year and look forward to continuing top and bottom-line growth to drive shareholder value creation in the coming months and years. And finally, I am excited about all the cultural advancements we have made in recent times to attract, inspire, and engage talent in the 2020s requires an acute awareness and commitment to deliver what that talent is looking for in their company's employee value proposition. We are a purpose driven company with an authentic commitment to diversity and inclusion. We are a company that cares about its stakeholders and is doing its share to be a force for good in society. This is an exciting place for people to thrive and live their purpose. So far it is working. Our ability to attract world class diverse talent has never been stronger and our passion for and conviction in differentiated performance, becoming known as one of the worlds’ most innovative companies and elevating our commitment to corporate social responsibility inspires us and motivates us every day. We are for those who make the world. And with that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, good morning. Lot of work going on there obviously. My question is on a couple on pricing. Do you feel reasonably confident on the surcharge going through? I don't know if you've had feedback from channel partners, if you've seen competition, what's been going on. So does that seem likely to go through? And then maybe just a little bit more of a structural question, you mentioned some really interesting data and analytics around the supply chain. Have you changed the analytics and internal rhythms around pricing as well? Such that I don't know if you're trying to move faster in an inflationary environment and I'll stop there. Thank you.
Don Allan: Thanks Rob. Those are great questions. And the first one, the surcharge, we have really tied it to these cost to serve costs, additional costs to serve items that we believe obviously are transient in some level. It's just a question of how long they linger in the system. And we believe, we have a very solid basis to make that price increase through a surcharge. We've received a lot of initial feedback from our customers and feel like we're in a very good place to ensure that gets in place in the fourth quarter. So feeling good about that at this stage. On the second around data analytics, I mean, I believe that actually on the pricing side, we got ahead of that a little earlier than we did on the supply chain side. And so we have fairly robust analytics in place around pricing. We don't – we look at pricing in a much broader way. So pricing is not just about list pricing increases or in this case, a surcharge it's about how do you really manage the mix in the business appropriately? How do you manage the pricing of new products when you put them in the market to ensure that you're pricing them at the right premium, giving the innovations that they are bringing to the end user? All those things have to be factored in. And our Tools team actually has the small organization that works on that full time. And their focus is really how do they drive margin improvement with all those different levers, which can be price – direct price increases can be surcharges, can be mixed management, new product introductions, as I mentioned. So all those things have to be looked at and we've been doing that for about two years now. And so that's a little bit ahead of the supply chain data analytics that Jim described, which really that was driven by necessity in the summer and fall of last year, just given the complexity of supply chain.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning.
Don Allan: Good morning
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Jeff Sprague: Just to explore price a little bit more, just correct me if I'm wrong on these kind of rough assumptions, but it seems like you're kind of modeling $700 million of price next year and I don't know, $400 million or so of it in North America. I just wonder if you could kind of address specifically North America price kind of the surcharge dynamic versus what you might be trying to do on base pricing. Just thinking about the mechanism here when you have to kind of give the surcharges back so to speak. So I'll leave it there.
Lee McChesney: Okay. Hey Jeff, good question. Your numbers are definitely in the right zone. I would do a couple catalysts, keep in mind that in the third quarter, we did execute our, I'll say 4.5% to 5% price increase. So we're delighted with that global execution. And as you look forward here with a surcharge it's in this 5% zone. And then across the globe, the different price increases are in that same range. So that's what we we're doing now. As Don noted earlier, the surcharges linked to these costs to serve increases certainly it's a dynamic environment as we go through the quarter here, if other things come to bear will look at doing other price actions in the first quarter as well, where there could be a bit of a plus and a minus to your point. If the cost to serve environment improves right now, our mindset is that's not going to happen.
Don Allan: Yes. I would just add to what Lee said at the end there. The cost to serve dynamic is interesting. It will improve eventually. The question is when will it approve? And so that's why, we took this approach around pricing fairly swiftly in the fourth quarter to respond to it. But we may be dealing with some of these supply chain challenges for another six to 12 months. Hopefully in the back half of 2022, we start to see them ease a little bit, but we're prepared for them to continue to remain for the full year of 2022.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: Yes. Hey everybody, good morning. Maybe just on the volume growth for 2022, the mid single digits that you're kind of highlighting, just curious kind of your confidence behind that and maybe how much of that is driven by just end market sellout growth. Any potential restocking and some of the kind of new product introductions and when you think about POWERSTACK and reviva, how would you kind of think about framing those growth opportunities over the next few years?
Jim Loree: Tim, we have made enormous investments in growth. As you can see by some of the output that we talked about here, and you just mentioned. 1300 new employees, $200 million of run rate investment in the run rate and just a massive commitment to increasing the intensity of sales, product development and e-commerce and all sorts of other growth oriented resources. And also as Don mentioned, adding capacity and so forth, the demand is strong. The conditions are supportive. So serving the demand, I think is the challenge. And I think we're confident we've created the demand and the environment is supportive and we need to serve the demand that is challenging, but you can see we delivered on our third quarter organic growth commitment, 10%, despite the challenges that we faced. And so we have a resilient organization and we have all the growth programs in place. And we have a high level of confidence that we can deliver that sort of growth. There's not a whole lot of restocking in that number, a couple of $100 million maybe a tad more, but I think it is important to point out that there's enough stock in the stores to support a POS growth environment, and that we're starting to see that in recent weeks. So we have gotten the inventories in retail up to where they were a year ago. And we still feel like there's a – maybe a two week to three week kind of additional opportunity for restocking and the retailers will enjoy higher fill rates, when that happens. But right now, the fill rates are sufficient to generate modest POS growth. And that's even before a lot of these new initiatives come to market.
Don Allan: I just add one thing to what Jim said. There is the cyclical recovery of industrial. That's still out there, now whether that all happens in one year, because we think that's about $300 million, it's still to be debated, but maybe it happens over two years we get a $100 million to $200 million next year and you get the rest in 2023. So that's kind of an addition to all the things that Jim just mentioned.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Julian Mitchell: Good morning, just wanted to circle back on the operating margin assumption. So it looks like you're aiming for around firm wide and 11% operating margin or so in the fourth quarter, just wanted to check that was roughly the right ballpark. And then for next year, it looks like the margin is sort of flattish maybe up a bit for the whole company for the year so maybe 14% or so. Maybe just help us understand how you expect the first half, second half margin cadence to move given your comments on the price and cost dynamics. Thank you.
Jim Loree: Yes, I would say that your presumption on the fourth quarter is pretty accurate. And next year, yes, the operating margin rate expands maybe 30, 40 basis points in that category year-over-year. If you look about, how things will kind of play out quarter-by-quarter, we will see a significant improvement in Q1 versus Q4. Things will get a little bit better in Q2 and then the back half, you'll see another step up of maybe half a point to a point in the back half versus the front half. So we would expect continued progression and improvement in those areas. The cost of serve will still be very high in particular in the first half of the year, but that's probably the right cadence for you to think about.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So just to recap, so we've got a 4% to 5% base price increase going in during the fourth quarter that then rolls forward – whatever rolls forward into 2022. And then we've got a 5% surcharge in North America in Tools & Storage. Just want to clarify that's what the plan entails and then what's the competitive response here and just if you can just give some flavor in terms of what you're seeing from competitors, are they going out with similar price increases and surcharges and given the import model from similar competitors, which are obviously more import intensive than you are, kind of any share shift that you're seeing within your channels?
Jim Loree: So I would say that, yes, the number you mentioned for price going in the fourth quarter is the right number. We believe that everyone for the most part is doing some type of price increasing. The question is what geographies and what magnitude, most of our competitors, if not all of them are being impacted by higher logistical costs to serve, additional costs, so to speak. So everybody's dealing with the same dynamic and it's a question of how much you want to have your margins impacted for a period of time versus offsetting it as quickly as you can with price increases. We've taken a very proactive approach where we have, as you saw from Lee, some significant headwinds that we're dealing with here in 2021 that carry over into 2022. They appear to have stabilized in the last 30 to 45 days, which is in our mind a very positive sign. Maybe we've hit the peak in this area. So now it's really about how do you drive the price increases on various products and different geographies to more than offset that. And so we feel fairly confident at this point that we can get, if not a 100% recovery on the price side versus the headwinds, pretty close to it. And so that's then our approach. Then we have productivity that over and above that, that'll help us fund investments and other things we need to do to continue to grow the business. That is the approach we're taking. And it's an unprecedented period of time around inflationary headwinds, but in some ways it helps us do what we need to do because it is so significant and everyone in the industries that we serve are dealing with it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Your line is open.
Markus Mittermaier: Yes. Hi, good morning. Maybe just one on…
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Markus Mittermaier: Good morning. On supply chain and your comments on semiconductors improving by Q1 2022, just to be sure I understand that right. Is that a Stanley specific comment around sort of your relationships with suppliers or is that market assumptions you make? And do we need that to happen for that dollar of accretion in the markets that you outlined? Thank you.
Jim Loree: It's certainly not a – we do not expect the industry-wide semiconductor market, the semiconductor industry-wide market to basically meet balanced supply and demand until probably 18 to 24 months from now just based on lead times and so forth. But we're a small player in the semiconductor world. We're a niche player and our ability to secure supply has been adequate at this point in time. And as Don mentioned in his remarks, we're already programming to have at least a 25% increase. But that is a Stanley specific phenomenon. And I can't speak for the auto industry or the appliance industry or other industries that use these types of semiconductors.
Don Allan: And I would add to that. To be very, very specific in my comments, we have enough commitments in battery cells and electronic components/chips to be able to expand our supply chain by 25% in power tools, if the demand is there for that to be served. And so that will happen by the spring of 2022 is what I was trying to say. And as we said, the guidance that we had for 2022 was mid single digits volume increase. So what he’s basically implying here is that there is, if the demand is there and it’s very robust, we have – we will have the ability to serve that demand.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Mike Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to circle back to some of the pluses and minuses of the guidance change in 2021. And apologies, if I didn’t catch all the details when you were kind of highlighting the four major differences. But you obviously, the big incremental headwind being the extra $230 million from the supply chain outlook and several offset to that, but still a net $0.50 impact on EPS. I was just trying to ascertain, you highlighted for next year the $100 million to $150 million of margin resiliency. I just wanted to understand how that had been factored in to guidance up until prior to today. And if you were expecting the $100 million to $150 million as a potential benefit this year if that’s still the case and how that has or continue to be reflected in guidance?
Don Allan: Yes. Sure, Michael. So as the year has gone on, obviously some of the margin resiliency has flowed through as each quarter has gone by. So as we got to the back half of the year, we still had $75 million to $100 million out there of possible margin resiliency available that was not in our guidance. A lot of that’s dropping through when I made reference to pricing actions and other actions of $0.30 of a positive when I did the walk from our previous guidance to the new guidance. And so that’s where you would see that play through. We do see another $100 million to $150 million next year that is not in the numbers that I mentioned. And so that would be there for contingency or outperformance as we usually do at the beginning of a year. And so I just wanted to clarify that as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Ken Zener: Good morning, everybody.
Jim Loree: Hey, Ken.
Ken Zener: So Jim, you kind of talked about verse 2019, the $6 billion of incremental, including MTB, and it is very impressive growth. I don’t recall you guys putting a surcharge in all the years that I’ve covered you. So can you talk about maybe just the battery technology that you talked about TTI’s out there, you guys are here, the platform, the batteries, the competitors keep getting squeezed yet, as we saw you couldn’t hit the growth rates in the fourth quarter because of these supply constraints. But could you just maybe take a step back and talk about how technology is really affecting the breadth of product and the tool platform is really increasingly squeezing out the competitors. And if that might change kind of less competitors, more capacity, if that might really change your kind of outlook in terms of how the competitive landscape is moving in your favor. Thank you.
Jim Loree: Yes. Well, I wish the competitive landscape was getting easier, but it’s not, it’s intensifying and hence the investments in innovation and capacity and growth and everything. So the pouch technology is very exciting though. It is as I mentioned in my remarks, 50% more power, 25%, more compact, 15% lighter and it lasts twice as long. You get twice as many charge cycles. And one of the nice things about it too, is that the pouch technology batteries do not compete with automotive. So we don’t have to worry about the cylindrical cells that go into power tools being much, much a smaller part of the cylindrical cell market. I don’t think cylindrical cells will go away over time, because the pouch cells are slightly more expensive. So, there’s probably a 10% to 20% type premium on the cost of a battery that lasts twice as long. It’s going to be a very pro oriented product. It’s going to play beautifully with the atomic and extreme compact tools. And over time, I expect it to grow to be a significant part of the market. But I don’t see it crowding out of the competitors. I mean, there are active vital competitors who are continuing to invest and it’s a hotly contested race for market share. I think we’re doing well, but so are some of the competitors.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe O’Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Joe O’Dea: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Joe O’Dea: Another one for you on pricing, but I just wanted to understand the mix of the surcharge and then the base pricing. And so when I think about kind of what’s implied in terms of the benefit that you’re anticipating next year, it looks like what would be – if we apply the total base pricing across the whole portfolio, it looks like what’s implied is more in the kind of 2% range. So when you talk about what you’re implementing right now versus what looks like could be maybe anticipated in terms of realized. Is that kind of the right interpretation that you’re just not sort of fully baking in 4% to 5% of realized base pricing? And it’s more the expectation that that could be 2%. And then why wouldn’t that be better?
Jim Loree: Yes. I’ll take that. So I’ll give you a quick answer, we can certainly answer more offline. But keep in mind that we put in the 4% to 5% price increase in the third quarter, and then globally here in the fourth quarter, we’re going after another 5% target. So, you will get to exactly what Don talked about a little bit earlier, which is this kind of 3.5% to 4% zone. That’s really the right mindset to have for 2022.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Thanks, Shannon. We’d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-27 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2021 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2021 second quarter conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, CEO; Don Allan, President and CFO and Lee McChesney Vice President of Corporate Finance and CFO of Tools & Storage. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Lee will review our 2021 second quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Loree.
James Loree: Thanks, Dennis and good morning everyone. This morning we announced a record second quarter which capped off a historic performance over the last 12 months. Over this period we have delivered $3.1 billion revenue growth now at a $17 billion LTM run rate. Adjusted operating margins reached new heights approaching 17%. Tools operating margins are in excess of 20% and we added $2.9 billion of sales growth in tools including outdoor over the last four quarters. My team and I are proud of the collective effort of our 56,000 Stanley Black & Decker colleagues. We thank them for their resilience and dedication, their agility to cut through the many challenges associated with executing on this massive growth trajectory during the global pandemic. The way they have stepped up is impressive, taking care of customers, our people, our communities, it's a great story. Turning to the second quarter, revenues were up 37% versus prior year to $4.3 billion. We achieved an all time organic growth record of 33% and marked the first time all three segments have currently organized achieved double-digit organic growth in the same quarter. The extraordinary organic growth of 41% in tools demonstrated the power of the world's leading tool company with the best brands and innovation in the industry. All regions delivered robust double-digit growth and our strong commercial and supply chain execution enabled us to capitalize on the positive secular trends and strong markets. Industrial accelerated to 14% organic growth behind the second straight quarter of double-digit growth and share gains in our automotive, general industrial and attachment tool businesses as recoveries in these end markets are continuing. The growth would have been even more robust if not for auto OEM [ph] production delays related to electronic component shortages, and by a few continued cyclically depressed markets such as aerospace. Security had its strongest quarter in the last 10 years delivering 14% organic growth. The security businesses transformation to a data enabled technology provider is accelerating and the team successfully converted a strong backlog into revenue. Order rates were red-hot in the quarter up 36% and the ending executable backlog was at record levels. We're excited about the full potential of these opportunities to support elevated revenue growth in the back half and beyond. Our overall company adjusted operating margin rate remained strong at 15.5%, up 270 basis points from the prior year, with volume leverage, price mix benefits from innovation and margin resiliency more than overcoming the cost of growth investments, commodity inflation and higher expedited transportation costs required to serve the strong demand in tools. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was a second quarter record at $3.08, up 93% over prior year and free cash flow for the quarter was $339 million, up 28% versus prior year, and over $300 million better on a year-to-date basis than our record setting 2020, a year in which free cash flow was $1.5 billion. On the heels of this great performance, we enter this second half with positive momentum and a portfolio that is well-positioned to capitalize on the key trends that are driving growth, a consumer reconnection with home and garden, e-commerce, electrification and health and safety. We are investing across our businesses to capture these opportunities and enable sustained above market growth with margin expansion. And to that end, we are raising our 2021 full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $11.35 to $11.65 per share, a 27% increase versus prior year at the midpoint. Finally, I'd also like to highlight the last week we increased our dividend for the 54th consecutive year. The quarterly payout now stands at $0.79 a share which represents a 13% increase. This is a reflection of the continued confidence we have in the cash generating power of the company.  A strong growing dividend is a key element of our shareholder value proposition and is consistent with our capital deployment strategy to return approximately half of our excess capital to shareholders over the long-term. Of course, repurchases are the other major vehicle we could employ to do that, and notably our Board increased our repurchase authorization last quarter to 20 million shares giving us the flexibility to do some of that as well. During our May Growth Summit broadcast, we showcased several significant catalysts that represent opportunities for a long and rewarding growth runway for Stanley Black & Decker. These catalysts capitalize on key 2020s trends many of which are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. We are expecting that the key market drivers across our global tools markets will continue to be strong demand drivers and support tools growth for some time. Including the secular surge in consumers reconnection with the home and garden as well as the cyclical expansion in North America home improvement, driven by new and existing home sales associated with household formation and the urban exodus. We are investing more than $200 million in innovation, e-commerce, sales and marketing and others, we have never been better positioned to capitalize on market trends. Across the board we have strategic differentiators that make us the world's leading tool company. Our iconic brands, DeWalt, Craftsman, Stanley, Stanley FatMax, and Black & Decker, our category depth, channel development and operations excellence and a track record and commitment to market-leading innovation, our pipeline has never been stronger. We are expanding our cordless product offerings up and down the power spectrum to new users and product categories with our flexible Flexvolt advantage and DeWalt power detect platforms, we are the industry leader in maximizing power output with plan to nearly double the number of products on these platforms over the next three years. Our Atomic and Xtreme platforms leverage the smallest most power dense brushless motor technology in the industry to deliver the highest power to weight ratio available in compact 20 V and 12 V platforms and will expand the product offering across these platforms roughly 4 times over the coming years. These breakthrough products have already delivered significant share gains and they are just getting started. The massive acceleration and the shift of demand to e-commerce was amplified during the pandemic which was an enormous positive for us. We have approximately three times the share in e-commerce as our next closest competitor and we grew our global e-commerce business from 13% of tool sales to 18% in a matter of 12 months, now about a $2 billion channel. This shift to e-commerce is going to continue and we are doubling down our investments in talent, digital capabilities, and our brands, including the revitalization of Black & Decker, which is an iconic brand that has a license to play in the largest breadth of categories within our portfolio. We see a significant opportunity over the coming years as the team re-imagines Black & Decker to drive it towards more youthful buyers as an e-commerce lifestyle brand. The increased focus on ESG and climate and what that means for electrification presents a very compelling multiyear opportunity for us as well. Our existing cordless outdoor power equipment business has grown over 70% in the first half of the year, and an engineered fastening the move from internal combustion engines to hybrid and EV platforms ultimately results into 3x increase in content per vehicle. And lastly, the transformation of our security business to become a technology driven, data solutions provider is gaining significant momentum, and the timing is excellent. The team has done a great job creating various solutions and products that are focused on health and safety, which has never been more relevant as the world continues to battle the pandemic. In addition to these growth opportunities, we are gaining momentum with our Margin Resiliency program. We continue to find new applications and use cases to apply our technology enabled approach that will deliver a runway for sustainable margin expansion in the coming years. And now a brief update on MTD. As many of you know, our option to acquire the remaining 80% of MTD opened up at the beginning of this month. This opportunity is exciting as we bring leading brands and capabilities in the electric outdoor category, as well as the ability to deploy the SBD Operating Model and apply our global scale. MTD brings superb product engineering and manufacturing expertise in outdoor power equipment, capabilities and robotics technology, as well as access to the independent dealer channel in outdoor. We were just at MTD's facilities in Valley City, Ohio last week and came away even more energized by the pipeline for innovation and the runway for growth in 2022 and beyond. The strategic fit is hand in glove and the revenue and cost synergy opportunities are compelling. We are currently in negotiations with MTD on the option execution and should they come to a successful conclusion, and subject to all regulatory approvals, we will begin work on tackling this multiyear opportunity for growth and margin expansion upon closing. And now I'll hand it over to Don Allan to cover a few financial details on MTD, a more detailed discussion on second quarter results, and offer up some 2021 guidance. Don?
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Before we leave Slide 5, as Jim mentioned, I want to make a few remarks about some significant financial attributes related to this exciting potential transaction. First, over the last 12 months ending June 30, MTD achieved revenue of approximately $2.5 billion. They have seen great traction on their Spotlight 10 initiative and have improved their EBITDA rate from approximately 4.5% in 2018 to high single digits over this LTM period. As I referenced at Investor Day, MTD has worked tirelessly to meet the supply chain challenges brought about by the pandemic, including limited throughput on larger products, as well as component and input shortages. However, this has muted their output in revenue over the last 12 months. We believe these are temporary and manageable disruptions that can improve with our application of the SBD Operating Model. Consistent with Investor Day and taking into account our recent diligence, we believe that our combined MTD and SBD outdoor platform can become a growth catalyst to deliver $200 million in organic growth per year over the medium-term. Our planning assumption for 2022 continues to call for the addition of MTD. Assuming $2.6 billion in revenue and continued progress on our own expansion, we believe this can contribute approximately 9% adjusted EBITDA margin or just over $230 million in consolidated adjusted EBITDA in 2022. Considering the benefits of our 20% stake currently in our P&L and applying interest and intangible amortization assumptions, this would result in approximately $0.50 of incremental adjusted EPS accretion in 2022. With our pathway for growth and margin expansion, this EPS accretion increases to over $1 by 2025, a strong P&L result that also carries a robust year forecast for our return on investment in the high teens. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the second quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 46% revenue growth with volume up 38%, currency up 5%, and price contributing an additional 3 points. The operating margin rate for this segment was 20.2%, up 320 basis points versus prior year. Volume, price and benefits from innovation and productivity were partially offset by commodity inflation, higher expedited transit costs to serve stronger demand, and new growth investments. The extraordinary Tools & Storage growth was realized across the globe again in Q2, with organic growth of 30% in North America, 63% in Europe and 85% in emerging markets. This performance was driven by the ongoing strong professional demand and robust levels of innovation across our brands, in addition to the continuation of the global penetration of e-commerce, outdoor product electrification, and the consumers reconnection with home and garden. We continue to see growth and share gain across our brick-and-mortar and e-commerce platforms in U.S. retail with the channel up 22% organically in the second quarter. POS remained robust and retail inventories ended the quarter still below normalized levels. Professional products are leading the growth across the front half and the share gains are consolidating. The first half 2021 POS is up approximately 40% compared to 2019. The North American commercial and industrial tool channels once again experienced positive sequential trends, accelerating to 68% organic growth. The growth was supported by strong professional driven demand and positive trends in manufacturing and industrial production, while our company specific marketing and digital efforts drove share gains with our industrial customers. The European tools business realized 63% organic growth, driven by an expansion in commercial, retail brick-and-mortar, and e-commerce channels, due to the strength of the industrial rebound, coupled with professional construction demand. All regions contributed to double-digit growth and share gains were led by the UK, France and Greece, which were up 130%, 73%, and 67% respectively. Finally, emerging markets was up over 85%, driven by higher construction related demand, all markets contributed to share gains. Latin America was up 136% organically, with all countries at least doubling and Asia delivered 36% organic growth, with at least double-digit growth across the region and India up nearly 3 times. Russia and Turkey delivered another solid performance with organic growth of 78% and 114% respectively. As highlighted at our May Growth Summit, our e-commerce initiative is a strategic growth driver for the business, and we are continuing to invest for further expansion. Second quarter global e-commerce revenue was up nearly 40% versus 2020 with a double-digit growth result from each region. Turning our attention to the Tools & Storage SPUs, our three SPUs had excellent contributions to the overall performance. Power Tools delivered 39% organic growth benefiting from supportive markets and our growth catalysts. This was enabled by the relentless supply chain execution combined with new and innovative product launches across Craftsman, Stanley FatMax and DeWalt. This includes an industry-leading breakthrough innovation, such as DeWalt Power Detect, Flexvolt Advantage, Atomic and Xtreme. DeWalt Flexvolt was our first breakthrough as many of you know and was once again a leader in 2021. Under this brand we are introducing a 15Ah battery and the 60 V SDS-Max 2 inch hammer, both of which will be world's first innovations. Our Flexvolt system is now up to 45 products and is forecasted to represent over $600 million in 2021 revenue. It remains a key growth driver and is a unique and advantage platform that we continue to leverage. We are passionate about innovation and the pipeline continues to be robust. Stay tuned as more breakthroughs are on the horizon for our power tool products. The Outdoor products business grew 40% organically with all regions contributing. This performance is driven by new listings in cordless innovations under the Black & Decker, Craftsman and DeWalt brands. This also includes expanding our offering in walk behind mowers and pressure washers, leveraging our flexible technology and the Black & Decker robotic mower launch in Europe. We continue to expand our cordless technology and other innovations through the outdoor electric category to drive growth, and are very encouraged about the future product pipeline. Finally, hand tools, accessories, and storage grew 42% organically, fueled by robust market demand, and new product introductions. We launched the new DeWalt tough series tape measures and hammers, as well as brought new power tool accessories to the market. We are expanding our offering of new metal and plastic storage solutions across both Craftsman and DeWalt brands in addition to further innovations across our key construction, auto and industrial markets. In summary, growth continues across the globe and within all three of the Tools & Storage SPUs. Equally as important, this growth comes with strong margin performance as a result of the team's continued resilience and disciplined price and supply chain execution. It was a fantastic performance for the Tools & Storage and Outdoor teams. Thank you both teams. Now turning to Industrial. This segment delivered 16% total revenue growth, which includes 13% volume, 3% currency, and 1 point of price. This was partially offset by 1 point from an oil and gas product line divestiture. Segment organic growth improved sequentially with positive 14% growth in the quarter. The operating margin rate of 10.9% was an increase of 210 basis points versus the prior year. Benefits from volume, price and productivity were partially offset by commodity inflation, growth investments, and choppy markets in oil and gas, as well as aerospace. Looking further within this segment engineered fastening organic revenues were up 26% as we continue to see improving automotive and industrial end markets. Our automotive fastener and system sales were up 63% organically. Our fastener organic growth significantly outpaced global light vehicle production, and was up nearly 90% in the second quarter. Out automotive systems business was up 5%, the second consecutive quarter of growth and a positive indication of improving OEM capital investment. At the segment level, we had an approximate 2 point negative revenue impact versus our second quarter plan from OEM semiconductor shortages, which disrupted vehicle production throughout the quarter. Industrial fasteners accelerated to 29% organic growth behind the continued recovery in global manufacturing and industrial activity. All regions contributed double-digit growth and realized share gains. The business soundly outpaced the global industrial production index. Aerospace fastener revenues continued to reduce versus 2020, as they deal with very slow markets due to limited new plane production. However, the recovery is on the horizon and expected likely to begin in 2022. Infrastructure organic revenues were down 11%. Attachment tools realized 16% growth, which was driven by increased OEM and independent dealer demand. Momentum continues to build in this market, with strong backlogs in order rates at our OEM and independent dealer customers. However, there was more than an offset by the dramatic reduction in pipeline activity which resulted in a 55% decline in oil and gas. This market is longer cycle as we know and is yet to see a recovery in new pipeline construction. Shifting to Security, total revenue was up 16% with 13% organic volume, a 6 point positive impact from currency, and a 1 point contribution from price. This was partially offset by a 5 point decline related to Internet, [ph] the international divestitures that we completed in the third quarter of last year. Overall North America was up 16% organically. We continue to get better access to customer sites, and we're able to convert our backlog within commercial electronic security. North America also benefited from strong growth within automatic doors and healthcare. European organic growth was up 12% as new data driven product solutions supported gains in France, and the Nordics, a strong performance considering that many of these markets still have pandemic related restrictions impacting installations. Our new Digital Solutions continued to build momentum, contributing approximately 2 to 3 points of growth, as the business continues to execute a required digital transformation. Overall order rates grew 36% in the second quarter, and the quarter end executable backlog with a record high, which positions the business to deliver high single digit organic growth for the remainder of 2021. Overall Security segment profit rate excluding charges was 8.5%, down 110 basis points versus the prior year rate, as price and volume gains were more than offset by the inefficiencies related to pandemic restrictions, and the cost impact from growth investments such as SaaS solutions, touchless door technology, and other health and safety options. We believe these inefficiencies will fade when the pandemic reaches its final stages, and as the growth investments contribute larger revenue dollars we will see the profitability rate of this business expand as well. Now I will turn the call to Lee McChesney to review cash flow and an update on material inflation, expedited transit costs, and our price actions. Lee?
Lee McChesney: Thank you, Don and good morning. Moving to Slide 7, we will review cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $339 million, which brings our year-to-date performance to $93 million. The quarter and year-to-date improvements versus prior year are predominantly driven by robust operational performance and earnings growth and was partially offset by higher working capital and capital spending versus prior year. We are investing in working capital to serve the unusual demands, as well as improvement inventory positions for our customers and for us. Working capital turns hit 6.7, a 1.1 turn improvement versus prior year, reflecting efficiencies delivered in accordance with the SBD Operating Model and the strong revenue performance. We are also making CapEx investments to drive margin resiliency and productivity as well to expand capacity and support further growth. We've had a great start to the year for free cash flow, up over $300 million versus the record 2020 performance, and remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for full year 2021. Turning to Slide 8. On the left side of the page I'll share some insight regarding the commodity and supply chain environment and SBD's counter measures. Looking at the top of the slide, we have included approximately $80 million of incremental expedited transit costs in the second half that we will incur to serve our improved demand assumption. The level of spend is fairly consistent to what we've realized in the front half of the year. This includes items such as premiums for expediting securing containers for our supply chain and air freight to keep pace with a hot tool market. These costs should alleviate as the global supply chain rebalances and presents an opportunity for cost savings and margin improvement in 2022 and beyond. Now moving to commodity inflation, we continue to see elevated commodity prices, and now expect $260 million of commodity inflation in the second half versus our prior assumption of $210 million. In particular, elevated steel pricing is largely driving the $50 million increase, and for the full year this is up about $65 million and approximately $300 million costs for 2021. Now in April, we discussed taking pricing and productivity actions to partially offset the incremental headwinds identified at that time. We are now in a full implementation mode, and believe we should be in a position to offset approximately 50% of the 2021 headwind. Netting material inflation and better price realization is a neutral effect versus the prior guidance. The goal was to have our actions in place during the third quarter, so that 2022 carryover benefits of price and margin actions fully offset the carryover inflation. And finally, we also have $50 to $60 million of margin resiliency savings that is not included in the guidance to absorb volatility or support better performance. Now I will turn it back to Don to cover our revenue assumptions for the back half.
Donald Allan: Thanks Lee. Shifting to the right hand side of the slide, I will now outline the full year organic growth and margin rate assumptions, both overall and by segment. We are raising the total company organic growth range to 16% to 18% versus our prior assumption of 11% to 13%. The primary driver is an improved outlook for Tools & Storage. Our visibility and confidence for sustained market demand continues to strengthen in addition to bringing channel inventories back to historical levels. We are raising the organic growth expectations for the segment to the low 20's versus our prior estimate of 14% to 16%.This results in mid-to-high single digit organic growth in the second half, which is supported by increased customer inventory, as well as continued strong global demand. This assumption represents second half organic growth of about 26% versus 2019, which is consistent with what we just delivered in the front half of 2021. The Industrial outlook is in the low to mid single digit range, which is slightly lower than our mid single digit assumption in April. The primary factors for the change are the impacts from the second quarter, as well as moderating our assumption for oil and gas for the remainder of the year. Lastly, Security organic growth is assumed to be high single digits. The record backlog in commercial electronic security is encouraging and coupled with our data and technology based product offerings, and health and safety solutions, we are optimistic for a strong second half for the business. We are assuming the margin rate for the entire company will improve 40 to 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect the Tools & Storage and Industrial margins to increase year-over-year, even given; one, some of the significant inflationary pressures expected in the second half; and two, key new investments to drive 2022 growth. The Security margins will be relatively flat to the prior year as we manage through the inefficiencies related to the pandemic restrictions, as well as the cost impact from our key growth investments. Now I’ll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on Slide 9. On a GAAP basis we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.80 up to $11.20, inclusive of various one time charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, we are increasing the EPS outlook to $11.35 up to $11.65 from the previous range of $10.70 to $11. Our revised 2021 guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 18% as just mentioned and at the midpoint adjusted EPS expansion of 27% versus prior year and 37% versus 2019. The updated outlook reflects our strong first half performance as well as improved visibility to demand in Tools & Storage. We continue to make investments to support our growth catalysts, increase the capacity in our supply chain, and drive our margin resiliency initiatives. The drivers for improved adjusted EPS are outlined on the right hand side of this slide. Walking from the $10.85 EPS midpoint from our April guidance, second quarter performance adds $0.35, second half volume leverage net of expedited transit costs required to meet the improved second half demand adds $0.30. Lastly, as Lee referenced earlier, strong realization in our price actions, offset increased commodity inflation and net to a neutral impact to our guidance. On the left side of this chart, we have disclosed our current year assumptions for the significant below the line items and our expectation for pre-tax M&A, and other charges to assist with your modeling. Behind the strong start to the year, the company is reiterating free cash flow to approximate GAAP net income. Therefore, we believe the free cash flow will likely approximate $1.7 billion in 2021. And lastly, we expect third quarter's adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21.5% of full year earnings. So in summary, our revised guidance calls for organic revenue growth of 16% to 18% and approximately 26% to 29% adjusted EPS expansion for the company in 2021. This is a very strong year-over-year expansion, yet balanced, recognized in the dynamic operating environment we all continue to navigate. Many of you are probably trying to gauge what this all means for 2022. While it is too early to make a call in the markets for that period of time, our objective and mindset is to grow our core earnings in 2022 in addition to the MTD accretion I outlined earlier. As you heard from Lee, we are in a great position from a price cost perspective and are expecting a neutral impact in 2022 from these items at current commodity prices. Additionally, as you heard at our growth summit in May, we have invested in a powerful set of organic growth initiatives and we are driving several key margin resiliency catalysts that give me confidence that organic revenue and earnings growth is achievable in 2022. The organization remains focused on day-to-day execution, implementing price increases and margin resiliency programs in response to commodity inflation and we are operating in accordance with our SBD Operating Model. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver above market organic growth, with operating leverage, strong free cash flow generation, and top quartile share for the returns over the long-term. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks.
James Loree: Thanks, Don. I'll keep this summary very brief so as to get right to Q&A. And as you've seen and heard we had a very strong finish to the first half as we delivered exceptional organic growth, strong margin performance, reflecting positive secular trends, vibrant markets and a strong array of growth catalysts. I'm pleased with the team's continued efforts and excited about the enormous potential given the improved outlook, strong momentum we've built over the last 12 months. And as we look to the future, our portfolio is uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends, several of which have been accelerated and amplified by the pandemic, the consumer reconnection with home and garden, e-commerce, electrification, and health and safety. We're capitalizing on this opportunity by funding innovation and commercial and capacity investments to support continued organic growth and share gains. And additionally, our option to acquire the remaining stake in MTD has the potential to generate significant revenue in 2022 and create an exciting multiyear runway for growth and significant EPS and cash flow accretion. Our passion for and conviction in differentiated performance, becoming known as one of the world's most innovative companies and elevating our commitment to corporate social responsibility, or ESG has never been stronger. And now we are ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great, thanks Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: Yes. Hey, good morning, guys. Nice shot on the first half here.
James Loree: Thank you.
Tim Wojs: My questions really on DIY versus Pro, just if you could elaborate on what you're seeing maybe in both markets, particularly DIY as you're starting to, my guess is or my sense is hitting tougher comps right about now in that market? And maybe you can dovetail back, or just with some color on some of the drivers Don, that you mentioned about the confidence around organic improvement in 2022?
Donald Allan: Yes, I mean, I think the way to think about DIY and professionals, and clearly we've seen a really strong ramp in professional activity starting in the fourth quarter of last year. But what's interesting, when you look across all our brands, we're seeing strength everywhere. So you saw strength across the different geographies. I mentioned the robust organic growth numbers. You've seen it in all the SPUs, and you're seeing it with all the brands. And so the activity is still pretty intense, both on the DIY and the professional side. Who knows how long the DIY trend will continue. The potential for a Delta variant, maybe slowing down certain activities in the U.S. and other countries could actually continue to stimulate DIY activity for a period of time. But what really has us excited is what's happening on the professional side and how that continues to be very strong. The activity across the globe is continuing to expand at a very rapid pace and obviously the need for our products continues to expand with it as well. So I -- as we sit here today and feel pretty good about the trend we're seeing going into the back half, we do believe there is a way to demonstrate growth in 2022, as I said, and although we'll deal with some tough hurdles and comps, these markets are very strong. And then you combine it with all the growth initiatives that we talked about in our May growth summit, I mean Jim went through them in a fair amount of detail in his opening comments as well today, those really get us excited about the opportunity. So even if demand does start to slow, we see hundreds of millions of dollars of growth opportunities across those particular areas, which has us excited, which is why we think we have the potential to demonstrate organic and earnings growth next year.
Dennis Lange: Shannon?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Brandon Reagan: Hey, good morning. This is Brandon Reagan on for Nigel Coe. I just was curious if you guys had any kind of position on the news that carriers potentially selling Chubb [ph] for $3 billion. Just wondering if this had any influence on your thoughts about the security options?
James Loree: Well, that's a, it's a, it's an interesting question, because I just happened to see it flash up on my phone about 30 minutes ago, but it is a very nice price. First of all, $3.1 billion, we consider 14.5 times LTM EBITDA must be adjusted a little bit, but still very high multiple. We believe our business is probably worth at least as much if not more, probably another turn or two more than Chubb [ph] all else equal. So you know, that I think pins evaluation on our business that is perhaps a little higher than even we thought it was. And so, there's no direct response to your question right now other than we are obviously digesting the news. And we will continue to evaluate options, whether they be retention of the business, disposition of the business or something in between. So that's where we are right now.
Donald Allan: And as I said, my comments would have us really excited before we make that decision that Jim was describing is the trajectory is on for organic growth with this really amazing performance in Q2, we think we could be looking at a business that is in the high single digit organic growth for the full year of 2021. And as the business continues to demonstrate that growth with its new growth initiatives into next year, the profitability rate will come with it. And we'll get past some of these pandemic restrictions as well as those growth investments will start to demonstrate more operating leverage. So we have the best of both worlds, I guess.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on your results.
James Loree: Thanks.
Michael Rehaut: Yes, I just wanted to talk a moment about MTD and a couple questions if I could kind of burn into one in this topic. Number one, your top line you had mentioned, looking at maybe $2.6 billion for 2022 as the company has encountered some maybe supply chain issues. I was wondering if you can kind of give us -- you talked about a $200 million organic growth type of opportunity on a combined basis. But how do you see it, do you see that there was any kind of share issues that might have cropped up I assume the broader market grew nicely, and how you intend to perhaps regain that share and grow the business organically? And then when you talk about, in negotiations for with MTD, for the option exercise. I was just curious, I think too many people just seem relatively straightforward that you had the opportunity to exercise or not, if there are any types of nuances that we might not be aware of, or is it more just a lot of, more basic blocking and tackling?
James Loree: Well, Michael, that's a lot of a lot of questions packed in one, but we'll tackle them. First of all, the market itself did grow nicely in 2021 and the growth for MTD was minimal nominal, and that can be traced entirely to supply chain issues. The demand was there and it continues to be there. But like many large equipment providers, they are -- they have struggled a bit with pandemic related issues, labor shortages, also some component shortages and things like that. Some companies have been situated in ways to manage them through the turbulence and still come out with great growth, as you can see in our tool business for example. Other companies may not have had all the wherewithal or the situation might not have lent itself to that same successful outcomes. And so, yes, there was a little bit of share loss because of the supply chain issues, but I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the fundamental strength of the company, the strength of the products, and the brands and the products themselves. I mean, we visited, as I mentioned, last week their headquarters and spent a couple hours looking at their product innovation pipeline. And I can tell you when we marry, successfully completing this deal with regulatory approvals, et cetera, when we are able to marry the brands of Stanley Black & Decker with the products that they've come up with already, and it's going to be a very, very exciting combination. So we're not concerned about the supply chain issues being a long-term issue. We have included in our pro formas a significant amount of resource to manage through those. We bring the scale and the expertise to help do that for them with them. The negotiations, really, so if you think back to the structure, the structure was predicated on essentially a multiple of EBITDA, and the incremental EBITDA that has grown since the time we initially took our 20% stake times 5.5 times, I mean, that's the formula. So, 5.5 times the EBITDA growth, under the theory that we both work together in different ways over the course of time to help them increase the EBITDA, so we should share that increase. And so, 5.5 times is half of11 times, which is what we paid for the 20%. So really, the only negotiation of significance boils down to certain due diligence items, which would be debt like items, maybe certain liabilities that we would see in environmental or tax or those types of things, as well as maybe some adjustments here and there for you to get from a GAAP EBITDA to an adjusted EBITDA, which the formula was based on. So, one example of that would be, since the formula was such a quantitative formula, that the temptation that most folks could have had and didn't actually do this, but they could have, say for instance, decreased their R&D, or they could have shut down their robotics business, which loses a modest amount of money to increase the EBITDA. We asked them to not do anything that would impair the company strategically for the benefit of financial, for their financial purchase price. And they've been very high integrity and so, there may be some adjustments of that sort, but that's fundamentally what's being negotiated.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Nicole DeBlase: So I guess the 3Q 21.5% of full year EPS, clearly a bit lower than the normal contribution and there's obviously a lot of moving pieces this year. So maybe you could talk a little bit about when you went through like the freight costs and the impact of price costs, how does that differ, if any, between 3Q and 4Q, just to think about the cadence of margins for the rest of the year?
James Loree: Yes, sure Nicole. Yes, I wouldn’t say that the material difference between the third quarter and the fourth quarter, you obviously have some differences in the sense of the timing of the pricing, whereas we continue to have discussions with our customers on price to be implemented throughout the third quarter and that should be completed by the end of the third quarter. So you have a little bit of cadence of that with a full quarter impact in the fourth quarter as a positive. So, that will be helpful trends. You also have something going the other way and the seasonality that plays out of Q3 versus Q4 every year, just the mix of promotions and mix of activities that happen in Q4 versus Q3 can result in anywhere from an 80 basis point to 120 basis point decline in margins in the tools business from Q3 to Q4. And so, when you factor those types of things in yes, we think the tools margins in the back half will be somewhere between 16% and 17%. So roughly 16.5% on average. Q3 will be around the high point of that range, and Q4 will be around the low point of that range. And so that's probably the right way to think it's just, due to that dynamic that I just described. The other two businesses will continue to modestly improve as far as Q2, Q3 to Q4 and their profitability rates, but not in a significant way. So I think that's probably helpful color in that area for you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ross Gilardi: Yes, good morning, guys.
James Loree: Good morning.
Ross Gilardi: Yes, I just wanted to go back to MTD a bit, probably you guys are, you're characterizing it as the revenue issue as more of a supply side issue, but clearly gas powered outdoor equipment and losing share to battery electric, which is part of the reason your own outdoor business is up 40%. So I'm just a little bit confused as to why you'd characterize that the shortfall in revenue for MTD as purely a supply side issue. I mean, they're primarily, correct me if I'm wrong, a gas powered outdoor equipment company today and gas powered equipment is ceding share to cordless. So could you just elaborate on that a little bit more?
James Loree: Well, if only it was as simple as that. The MTD folks basically make gas powered equipment and specialize in higher end of zero-turn mowers and riding mowers and have some but a relatively limited walk behind business in terms of dollar percentage of total. So electric penetration into riders and zero-turns is roughly about 1% and has stayed pretty constant. So we can't paint MTD with that brush that you are painting them with, number one, because their mix is gas powered. And we know that other gas powered, heavy outdoor power equipment makers grew. And these include some companies that we're very familiar with, that grew in the 10% to 20% range during that quarter. So it is what it is. It's not a shift to electric. We will make that happen later if we're able to execute on this and that's kind of where we are at this point.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.
Eric Bosshard: Good morning. Yes -- on the tools business, just two things would love to understand a little bit better. First of all, your sense from a market share standpoint, where you're making the most notable progress? And then secondly, your interaction with your retailers, you talked about inventory, but their commitment to building inventories from here and they're focus on that, if you could just expand on those two areas that would be great. Thank you.
James Loree: I'd love to hear your opinion on that Eric, but market share in terms of progress, are you talking about products? Are you talking about competitors? All the above? I mean, clearly, there's a very intense battle going on between us and TTI. TTI has picked exclusive, an exclusive strategy in the home centers, with one player, as well as a kind of commercial and industrial strategy predicated on a lot of feet on the street and a lot of investment in sales and marketing resources in that regard. Brand to brand, I'd say, when you look at the two brands, DeWalt and Milwaukee, we believe DeWalt is a stronger brand, but not by that much. When we look at Craftsman and Ryobi, we think that Craftsman is a far stronger brand than Ryobi and that's based on actual research. So, that's kind of the setup there globally. TTI is making some progress, making some investments around the world, but it's largely focused historically on North America and on Australia, New Zealand. So that's kind of the stage there. The interaction with retailers, I think the retailers are as optimistic as we are about the future and I think they would love to have more inventory yesterday. And we keep getting those reminders as we operate our factory system at full bore. And, we're adding capacity, we're adding several plants this year, and that will help. We're also working on making sure that we're looking out far enough on all components that we need and expediting components all around the world to make sure that we can serve their needs from a supply chain perspective, and continue to gain share. So interaction with retailers is great, it's intense. People are kind of really seeking more product and we're doing everything we can to do that, meet their needs.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me, if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2021 first quarter conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, CEO; Don Allan, President and CFO and Lee Mcchesney Vice President of Corporate Finance and CFO of Tools & Storage. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Lee will review our 2021 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with other calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Loree.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Dennis and good morning everyone. I have to say it’s an exciting day for us here at Stanley Black & Decker. Today, we have the opportunity to report an outstanding start to 2021 highlighted by record revenue and EPS and many other accomplishments. These powerful results were backed by strong markets and excellent operational execution, which supports our improved outlook for the year. And thank you to our 53,000 employees around the globe who delivered these results by maintaining focus on our pandemic era priorities. The priorities of employee health and safety serving our customers with continuous operations and doing our part to help our communities mitigate the impact of the virus have served us extraordinarily well this past year. First quarter revenues were up 34% to $4.2 billion versus prior year, each of our segments and regions contributed to deliver an all-time record 31% organic growth. Our Tools & Storage business continued on its extraordinary growth trajectory, with 45% organic growth, yes, 45% growth in the quarter. All regions and business units contributed to the performance, with blazing hot markets across the globe, led by a confluence of positive factors. Vibrant markets and secular trends, including the consumers reconnection with a home and garden, ecommerce, and outdoor electrification in concert with our ubiquitous channel strategy and an intense focus on supply chain execution enabled a strong business growth. Our portfolio of iconic brands such as DeWalt, Craftsman and Stanley, in combination with industry leading innovation has proven to consistently deliver on-going gains and market share at the POS level and now at the selling level as well. The tools first quarter performance is an outstanding example of what this powerful combination can deliver. Industrial organic growth was 6% as we've seen a strong double digit recovery in automotive, general industrial and attachment tool and markets along with share gains. This was partially muted by continued market declines in aerospace and oil and gas. And for security, 1% organic growth was in line with our expectations given the many restrictions placed on our installation and service techs. We make continual progress with our digital health and safety product offerings, and the security business transformation to a data enabled technology provider is accelerating. We are excited about the full potential of these opportunities to support revenue growth throughout the year. And that was great news regarding our operating margin rate as well. The rate for the quarter was 17.6%, up 760 basis points from the prior year. But volume leverage, productivity, cost control, price and margin resiliency all contributing. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was another all-time record at $3.13, up 161% over prior year. And both our operating cash flow and free cash flow were each about $240 million higher than in the same period in 2020, a year in which the company generated a record $1.7 billion in free cash flow. All-in, an impressive first quarter and a strong start to 2021. This great performance and the sustained market recovery through April has given us more visibility into the second quarter and to some extent the back half as well. As a result, our point of view for 2021 and momentum going into 2022 has significantly improved since I outlined our initial observations during our January earnings call. First, as you can see, tools remains on a roll. In addition to all the positives already mentioned, the Pro is back in full force, and the commercial and industrial markets are hot as well. Europe is far stronger than previously imaginable given many countries are still bogged down in lock downs and the emerging markets are blazing. We are clearly benefiting from secular trends that have been amplified and accelerated by the pandemic. We're also benefiting from the extraordinary efforts of our people to manage the supply chain effectively amidst numerous challenges, including parts availability among others. With that said, many of our retail partners would like to replenish their inventories as our current production levels are basically serving their point of sale growth. In this regard, we recently have begun production in two new factories in Mexico and an additional one in Fort Worth, Texas will be up and running in a matter of weeks. Our current view is that this will enable the approximate four week channel inventory rebuild to occur in the back half of this year. The secular surge and global DIY driven by the consumers reconnection with the Home and Garden continues to be a key demand driver across our global markets. The massive shift to e-commerce continues and we achieved nearly 100% growth in this growing channel during the quarter. The electrification of the outdoor product market is accelerating just as we have launched a significant number of new products and increased listings. We now expect this business to reach $900 million in 2021 up approximately $250 million versus last year. We are already benefiting from our multi year relationship with MTD and our option to acquire the remaining 80% at a very attractive seven to eight times EBITDA multiple with a window that opens in July of this year. Our success comes from building a position as the world's leading Tool Company that can attract diverse world class talent in an array of iconic brands, market leading and leading innovation, immense category, breadth and depth, and a passion to serve our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. In this regard, I would like to underscore a key point. We are gaining share and making bold investments to widen our lead in the future. And as it relates to profitability, we once again delivered significant gross margin and operating margin expansion and are continuing to perform at historically strong levels. At this point, all temporary cost options have been restored. And we are making significant investments as I said. We have incorporated increased inflation into our outlook and we are taking aggressive actions to protect our margins in 2021, 2022 and Lee will review those in a few moments. Additionally, our tech enabled margin resiliency program will support our margin rates. And finally, the market rebounds across automotive, general industrial and attachment and markets and security continued. We remain optimistic that this will continue and the potential for increased global infrastructure spend could enable further gains across the portfolio. So in summary, we have high conviction in our prospects for growth, supported by our catalysts, the positive trends I outlined benefiting our markets and cyclical recoveries across the businesses. As a result, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10.70 to $11 per share. This represents a significant update from our security's previous guidance. The revised midpoint of $10.85 now reflects a 20% increase versus prior year with a total company organic growth at 11% to 13% for the year. And as you can see, there's a lot to be excited about in what lies ahead of us in terms of significant opportunities for value creation. And now I will turn it over to Don Allan to cover the first quarter and our updated 2021 guidance.
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim. And good morning everyone. I am pleased to report on the business segment results that contributed to our exceptional start to 2021. Tools & Storage delivered 48% revenue growth with volume up 42% and price and currency each contributing an additional three points, resulting in 45% organic growth for the first quarter. In addition, the operating margin rate for the segment was 21.4% up 990 basis points versus the prior year. This is the result of the team's relentless focus on margin excellence and strong operational performance. Volume, price, productivity and cost control were the main drivers of this expansion. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher costs and supply chains such as expediting product via air freight to serve the incredibly strong demand, as well as new growth investments to support share gains in the future. On a geographic basis, we had incredibly strong organic growth and market share gains across all regions, up 41% North America, 47% in Europe, and 67% in emerging markets. This performance was driven by our industry leading innovation, strong professional demand, and the on-going trends from secular shifts related to e-commerce, outdoor product electrification, and the consumers reconnection with the home and garden. The U.S. retail channel delivered 48% organic growth, as underlying consumer demand remained elevated with continued momentum from professional and DIY users. Additionally, our omni channel and etailer e commerce platforms nearly doubled in the first quarter, which further reinforces our conviction behind the additional investments we are making to capture this accelerating opportunity. Point-of-Sale growth for the quarter remained exceptionally strong and consistent with the high end of our forecasted Q1 range. Retailer inventories remain relatively in line with Q4 2020 levels, so the anticipated increase in store inventories of approximately four to five weeks is now expected to occur in the back half of the year. The North American commercial and industrial tool channels are continuing to experience positive sequential trends with growth in the mid-30s versus low single digit decline in Q4 2020. Pure play construction focus customers within these channels were up close to 40% more than two times the mid-teens growth we experienced last quarter. That resounding signal that the pro is back and demand is clearly accelerating this space. Also, with the recent positive trends in North American industrial manufacturing activity, our MRO customer base rebounded this quarter as well posting growth in the high 20s as compared to double digit decline in the fourth quarter. Now shifting to Europe, the European tools business relies impressive share gains across all regions generated by the rapid acceleration of e-commerce as well as a retail champ -- the retail channel strength. This performance was led by more than 80% organic growth in the U.K. while France, Central Europe, the Nordics, Italy and Iberia were all up over 30%. Finally, the momentum in emerging markets continued to accelerate with strong construction related demand in addition to impressive traction in e-commerce. Latin America was up 77% organically, with all countries up over 50% and led by an outstanding 86% growth in Brazil. Asia delivered 62% organic growth with China and India both at least doubling in size. South Korea, Malaysia, and Vietnam all grew in excess of 50%, while Japan, Thailand and Indonesia each posted strong double-digit growth for the quarter. Russia and Turkey remained strong, delivering 52% and 89% growth respectively. Those numbers are absolutely crazy, but they're wonderful. So let's turn our attention to Tools & Storage SPUs after reviewing the fantastic geographic revenue performance. Power Tools delivered 50% organic growth, which was the result of continued momentum from the positive home and construction trends, as well as sharp commercial, and supply chain execution combined with new product launches. New core innovations led the way, building upon our strength of Craftsman, the fastest growing brand in the industry, and DeWalt, the largest professional tool brand in the world as measured by total revenue. We built these positions with industry leading innovation, launching products such as Flexvolt, Atomic, Xtreme, Power Detect, Flexvolt Advantage all within the last five years. These products are delivering growth well ahead of the SPU average and are positioned for our pro users. To further highlight positive professional demand, Flexvolt grew over 80% in the quarter. This quarter and moving ahead, we are providing more top line disclosure for our outdoor products business, particularly as it increases importance of the growth catalysts and with our option to purchase the remaining 80% of MTD opening mid-year. I am pleased to report it was a record breaking start to the season with organic growth in excess of 120%. This performance is driven by the incremental listening wins we covered last quarter, and leveraging cordless innovations under the Black & Decker Craftsman and DeWalt brands. All of our major retailers participated in this explosive growth. It’s exciting to see our new products at the market and early season reads on cell two are very positive. This is a major growth margin and ESG opportunity. As we shape the conversion to electrification and bring our cordless capabilities to the outdoor equipment market. We could not be more excited about this industry and the growth potential it creates for our company over the next several years. Finally, hand tools, accessories and storage grew 28% organically as market rebounds, and new product introductions fueled the growth. We continue to innovate in our key construction auto and industrial markets. We are seeing new product momentum, including a variety of Craftsman and DeWalt plastic and metal storage solutions, as well as robots growth and the new DeWalt tape measures and accessories. So in summary, there are a few points I want to reinforce related to our Tools & Storage business. One, we continue to leverage an industry leading position. The team has built this position over time and it is supported by our innovation, brands, category breadth, operational excellence, and focus on keeping our customers and end users at the center of what we do. Two, this is a global phenomenon. The powerful trends that we are harnessing for growth are not unique to one geography. And three, this is fueled, enabled by the dedication, passion and agility of our people. The business delivered the largest first quarter in history as it relates to sales, profits and margin rate and the execution was superb. Thank you to the entire team for a job well done. I am excited about the possibility of record breaking performance is continuing in the future quarters. Well done, tools team. Moving to Industrial, this segment delivered 11% total revenue growth, which includes 6% volume 3% currency, and 3% from the CAM acquisition. This was partially offset by one point from an oil and gas product line divestiture. Segment organic growth continued to improve sequentially with positive 6% growth in the quarter. The operating margin reached 15.9%, an increase of 270 basis points versus prior year as the benefits from volume, productivity and cost reductions were only partially offset by new growth investments. Looking further within the segment, engineered fastening revenues were up 9% organically, as we continue to see improving automotive and industrial end markets. Automotive fasteners were up 16%, outpacing global light vehicle production by approximately 500 basis points. This was held back somewhat as we move through the quarter and navigated OEM disruptions due to their supply shortages. Our automotive system business was up 17% a very good sign that capital spending is improving with our automotive OEM. Growth within industrial fasteners turned positive this quarter, delivering low double digit growth driven by the continued momentum and global manufacturing and industrial activity. Combined with a modest impact from customer inventory increases. Infrastructure organic revenues were down 2% however, attachment tools had 16% growth as demand increase from OEMs and independent dealers. This was more than offset by significantly reduced pipeline construction activity, which resulted in a 30% decline in oil and gas. Shifting to Security. Total revenue was up 2% with a four point positive impact from currency, from price and acquisitions each contributed a point. This was partially offset by a four point decline related to the international divestitures completed in the third quarter of last year. Overall, North America was flat organically as growth and health and safety offerings within automatic doors and healthcare were offset by lower installations within commercial electronic security. The field organization continues to experience productivity challenges, as their customers slowly reopen and allow more on site access. European organic growth was up 4% as new Data Driven Product Solutions supported 17% growth in France, and 4% in the Nordics. France in particular has embraced the technology transfer in a transformation we ignited in this business in 2019. And it's experiencing the growth that we believe is possible across the entirety of commercial electronic security. Our new solutions in health and safety continued to build momentum, contributing approximately two points of growth in the quarter. The positive secular trends and underlying demand once again proved resilient in these markets despite incremental lockdowns due to the pandemic. The bidding code activity for these new solutions continues to build. And that combined with the executable backlog at record highs gives us confidence that security is set up to deliver strong organic growth for the remainder of 2021. Overall security segment profit rate, excluding charges were 8.5%, up 110 basis points versus the prior year. As price and cost control was partially offset by the impact from growth investments related to our SaaS solutions, touchless door technology and other health and safety apps. I would now like to turn it over to Lee Mcchesney who is our VP of Corporate Finance and CFO for Tools & Storage. Many of you know Lee from investor conferences over the last year, and he will now walk you through the cash flow for the quarter. And our game plan to tackle inflation. Lee?
Lee Mcchesney: Thank you, Don and good morning, everyone. Moving to slide seven, I will now review our free cash flow performance. Free cash flow improved $242 million versus prior year behind a strong operational performance and earnings growth. Now please keep in mind that a free cash outflow in the first quarter is in line with normal working capital seasonality, which was somewhat amplified by the strong demand to start the year as compared to historically slower period for the business. Working capital balances also are higher than prior year as you work to serve the strong demand as well as improve the inventory positions for us and our customers. Now, despite the higher balances, working capital turns hit 7.1 a one point turn improvement versus prior year. We remain confident that we will do with a strong cash flow generation for the year inclusive of CapEx investments to support further growth. We will continue to drive working capital efficiency across the company in combination with a strong earnings performance. I’d now like to give you a quick update on commodity inflation. As many of you follow, steel and resin represent the two largest commodity exposures, and they have been impacted by rapid spot market increases as a global supply chain responds to the surge of demand and temporary supply gaps. This dynamic has occurred across many of our key commodities, opponents finished goods that we purchase. We now expect inflation headwinds to approximate $235 million, which is up $160 million versus our previous outlook of $75 million. Currency however, remains at $45 million positive offset to this cost pressure. The drivers of the incremental inflation are steel, resins, copper, aluminum, and some purchase materials such as batteries and electrical components. And as a reminder, we generally lock in our supply agreements one to two quarters in advance. And this pressure has to work its way through inventory and therefore, the majority of this year-over-year headwinds will be realized in the second half of the year. In response, we are initiating additional pricing and productivity actions, which will partially offset the 2021 impact of the headwinds as well provide a significant carryover benefits into 2022. We believe these actions can offset about a third to a half of the 160 million incremental headwinds, and I've included that assumption in our guidance. Additionally, we continue to have approximately $100 million of margin resiliency available over the balance of the year, which is not included in our guidance today. This will act as an additional contingency to help us offset any incremental headwinds that may materialize or support a better margin outcome for the full year. We are remaining agile in our response to inflation and are leveraging the SPD operating model to continue to deliver the strong margin levels we've established in full year 2020 and implied in our guidance for 2021. With that, I'll turn it back over to Don, who will walk you through our updated guidance.
Don Allan: Thanks Lee. Turning to slide nine, I will now outline the organic growth assumptions for both the second quarter and full year. We expect second quarter organic revenue growth to approximate 30% for the company. In 2Q we expect the Tools & Storage business to grow 35% to 40% with continued strength across all regions and channels. We are planning for industrial to grow in the mid-to-high teens with continued momentum and industrial fasteners and markets and attachment tools. Automotive will continue to show growth on the easier comps. But we haven't cooperated moderated demand levels versus Q1 acknowledging the OEM supply constraints in the industry. Finally, aerospace and oil and gas were expected to remain depressed partially offsetting the stronger growth expectations and other areas of the segment. Turning to Security, we expect low double digit growth in the second quarter. We plan for revenue levels to improve sequentially, as we will benefit from increased access to customer sites to execute on the record backlog from the first quarter. Shifting to the full year we are raising the total company organic growth range to 11% to 13% with upward revisions in Tools & Storage and Industrial. Our confidence of growing market demand in Tools & Storage continues to strengthen. We are raising the Tools & Storage organic growth expectations to 14% to 16% versus our prior estimate of 4% to 8% for the full year. Both the first and second half assumptions improved. The first half assumption is based on stronger visibility to Q2 demand combined with the outstanding Q1 performance. The second half assumption includes the benefit from increases in channel inventory back to historical levels. Despite the improvement, we are assuming a decline between 2% to 4% in the back half acknowledging the tough comps. This represents growth of 12% to 16% versus 2019 and as a reasonable to your growth assumption given the strong market recovery occurring. However, we are preparing the supply chain for stronger demand scenarios and we will be ready should our planning assumption prove to be conservative, which is very which it very well could be given current global demand trends. The industrial outlook improved to 4% to 6% for 2021 as we have better visibility to industrial and attachment to market recoveries. We have built in the expected automotive customer supply chain constraints into our view. And then finally, aerospace and oil and gas will continue to be a significant headwind. Right now our view is that these markets will remain depressed for 2021 but become an upside opportunity next year. Lastly, we are maintaining our security organic growth assumption at 4% to 6% for the full year. The record backlog and commercial electronic security is encouraging and coupled with our data and technology based product offerings, and health and safety solutions. We are optimistic that the growth can accelerate throughout the remainder of the year. Now I'll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on slide 10. We are raising and narrowing the 2021 adjusted EPS outlook to reflect the exceptional start to the year and improve demand outlook across most of our businesses. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $10.15 to $10.55 inclusive of various one time charges related to facility moves beyond integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. On an adjusted basis, we are increasing the EPS outlook from a $9.70 to $10.30 range, up to a $10.70 to $11 range. At the midpoint this is an increase of $0.85 versus the prior year guide and a 20% EPS growth versus the prior year. The drivers for improved adjusted EPS are outlined on the right hand side of the slide. Walking from the $10 midpoint from our January guidance, incremental pricing and volume net of incremental growth investments, along with margin resiliency, and other actions contribute approximately $1.50. This is partially offset by commodity inflation headwinds of approximately $0.80. In addition, we are planning to call our Series C Preferred Stock and the elimination of the preferred dividend adds a $0.15 benefit to 2021 bringing us to the current adjusted EPS midpoint of $10.85. Demand variability that I covered earlier remains at the primary driver beyond the adjusted EPS. We have also disclosed our current year full -- our current full year assumptions for the significant below the line items and our expectation for the pretax M&A and other charges to assist with your modeling. Additionally, the company is reiterating free cash flow to approximate GAAP net income. And lastly, we expect second quarters adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 25% of the full year performance. So in summary, we expect 11% to 13% organic growth, and approximately 18% to 22% adjusted EPS expansion for the company in 2021. A very healthy EPS expansion for the year, yet a balanced view recognizing the dynamic operating environment. As I said earlier, we are preparing for the potential for higher market demand beyond this guidance view and, as Lee mentioned have $100 million of margin resiliency not included in our guidance as a contingency to drive better performance or withstand new volatility. From a capital allocation point of view, we are very well positioned and have excellent flexibility due to our current cash position and leverage ratios. Therefore, we can retire the preferred stock mentioned earlier and react accordingly if our stock price trend presents an opportunity in the short term while staying on track with our expected timing of MTD later this year or early next. We are confident that we have positioned the company to deliver above market organic growth with operating leverage, strong free cash flow generation and top quartile shareholder returns over the long term, all while maintaining the safety of our employees and continuing to assist in our communities. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jim to conclude with a summary of our prepared remarks.
Jim Loree: Thanks so much Don. And as you have they have seen and heard we had a very strong start to the year as we delivered record organic growth reflecting positive secular trends, vibrant markets and a strong array of growth catalysts. I am pleased with our team's continued efforts and excited about the enormous potential given the improved outlook and strong momentum we've built over the last 12 months. As we look to the future, our portfolio is uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends, several of which have been accelerated and amplified by the pandemic, the consumer reconnection with Home and Garden, ecommerce, electrification and health and safety. We are capitalizing on this opportunity by funding innovation, commercial and capacity investments to support continued organic growth and share gains. Additionally, our option to acquire the remaining stake in MTD in July has the potential to add up to $3 billion of revenue in 2022 and create an exciting multiyear runway for growth and significant EPS and cash flow accretion. Our passion for positive differentiated performance, becoming known as one of the world's most innovative companies and elevating our commitment to corporate social responsibility ESG has never been stronger. And that is in the wake of 1,016% TSR delivery during the 20 years or so since I've held C level positions in this company with support during that entire period from Don and Lee. We have a clear vision for winning in the 2020s taking our story to yet an even higher level, which you'll see up close and personal if you attend our virtual growth summit on May 13. This event will be a great opportunity for us to communicate more details on the compelling array of opportunities we are pursuing for growth and margin expansion, as well as our strong commitment to planet people, prosperity and governance. We will be showcasing a number of the executives leading these initiatives. So please reach out to Dennis, if you're interested in attending. And we look forward to seeing you there. And now we're ready for a Q&Q. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] :
Nigel Coe: Thanks, guys. Good morning.
Jim Loree: Nigel, good morning.
Nigel Coe: A lot to unpack here. But I think I'll get the ball rolling on inflation. Obviously a big, big step up in the 235 how well ringfenced is that 235 at this point. Are you seeing current spot prices hold, for the balance of the year, and maybe just talk about the price actions you're planning to try and cover that. In particular, I know it’s industrial had neutral pricings. So I'm just wondering, what's, what's the strategy trying to recover price in industrial? Thanks.
Jim Loree: Yes, sure. I'll start with that. And then Lee will probably add a little color to. Yes, I mean, we were at 235 for inflation, the impact this year, up about $160 million from what we said back in January. I would say this is a very volatile environment right now. And it really depends on where the demand goes in the back half of the year. I do believe as the year progresses and we get closer to July, it's difficult to have a material impact in the current year, if inflation continues to increase. That being said, there's been a few positive trends in some of these commodities in the last two or three weeks but it appears to be stabilizing. So two or three weeks does not make a trend. But it's something that at least is encouraging in the sense that maybe this is starting to modulate a little bit. But it will be one of the more volatile things that we'll have to manage. Now, the good news is that I do believe we will be managing to a very strong demand market for the remainder of the year, most likely into next year as well. And so that clearly is a benefit associated with inflation. We are aggressively underway have focused on pricing actions across the two major businesses where there's impact, which is obviously Tools & Storage and industrial. Tools & Storage will do what they typically do, which is a very surgical approach focused on areas that we think pricing does not impact demand in a significant way. And so we will manage through that dynamic with our customers as we always do. And I think we'll have a pretty good success rate. Industrial actually is an area that we feel better about. We feel like we have good processes in place, we've already got price actions that we've taken in the last 30 days. And we will likely take some more in the next 90 days in those particular businesses. But we feel like that is well under control and the industrial team has been very focused on that. So I think the area of interest that we're all going to be watching is making sure we get the right impact and pricing in the tools and storage business. Now that being said, we do, we normally do to manage to this dynamic, which is in the short term. We're looking at other areas of productivity. We look at margin resilience is our contingency to help offset that if needed. And we're optimistic as we go through the year that we will find a way to navigate this headwind and be able to offset it completely. Right now, as Lee said we think we're more like 1/3 to 50% at this stage, but as the next three months go by, I think we're going to make more progress in that regard. Anything you want to add Lee?
Lee Mcchesney: Yes, I think you said it. Well, it's volatile. But we are we are off promoting on the action side, it's going on in all three businesses. Some have been announced. But we're in conversations with, with all really all parties. And then I remind everyone, we still have our margin resiliency contingency, where we have $100 million, that's not in our guidance. So if inflation was to creep up, we have some coverage there. And, I think we've built a pretty good place.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning.
Jim Loree: Hey Jeff, good morning.
Jeff Sprague: Good morning. Congrats, hey, maybe this play a little bit into the cost question, but just curious on the new plants, right, to Mexico and Fort Worth finally standing up, I think, you know, initially, those were viewed as kind of presenting an opportunity to shift geographically and get out from under [Indiscernible]. It sounds like they might just simply be need needed for volume, but to what extent do you see an opportunity, to geographically shift to sourcing. And, and kind of change the cost structure from that vantage point.
Jim Loree: We'll get there eventually. I would say, unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, but the volume you're spot on the volume has precluded any major shift, although you get minor shifts, because the waiting, the change in waiting just from having the additional production in, in these places. But the reality is, in when you're trying to serve, demand, that's up 45%, year-over-year, the opportunity to do production shifts is essentially, limited. And so once the demand returns to what I would call more historical levels, and at some point, it undoubtedly well, then the trend will be in great shape in terms of, we have the plans and programs, we have the people all set up to do it, we just need a window of opportunity to make that happen. And in the meantime, we'll continue to serve the demand that we have.
Lee Mcchesney: Yes, I'll just add one thing to that. One thing we are doing is, as we bring up these new plants in Mexico, we are building out the supply base in Mexico with it. And so, to Jim's point, whenever we do get to the stage where we can ship, more production from China into Mexico as an example, the supply base will be well established and well connected to our existing facilities at that stage.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to circle back. Good morning, just wanted to circle back to the margin outlook. Looking at the sort of the guidance for Q2 and what you've said for the year, am I writing thinking that the second half sort of firm wide margin, you're looking at maybe a better sort of 15%, maybe a little bit lower margin in the second half. So down maybe a couple of 100 points year-on-year, just wanted to make sure I wasn't way off on that mat, and also sort of allied to that, if you could help us understand of the 235 million commodity headwinds, how much of that is in the second half, please?
Jim Loree: Yes, the commodity headwinds is close to $200 million in the second half. So a large portion that $235 is hitting us in the second half. So which really is a good lead into your first part of your question, which, I do think the operating margin for the company in Q2 will be somewhere around 15%, maybe a little bit higher than 15%, then the back half, it'll be somewhere between 14% and 14.5%, depending on how -- where the demand goes and, and our success and really offsetting that headwind along the lines I described. And so for the full year, our operating margin rate will be up modestly year-over-year. When you look at the big drivers of that clearly a large part of that is in our tools business, because that's where a large part of the commodity headwind is focused at this stage. And so for the second quarter, tool should be around 19%, maybe a little bit better 19% than 19%. And in the back half, it'll be around 17% to 17.5% margins. And so we look at that and we say that's just slightly below our 18% to 20% range that we laid out there and we just want to remind everybody that range wasn't necessarily applicable for every single quarter, it was more about an annual performance and a long term performance as well. And so for the year, we would expect the tools operating margin rate to be, somewhere between 18.5% and 19%. And which would be a significant increase over last year's margin rate of 18.3%.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: Yes. Hey, Hey, everybody. Nice. Nice work, good start to the year.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Tim.
Tim Wojs: Maybe my my question really just on supply chain? I guess where are you seeing the most acute pressure on the supply side? And maybe if you could just talk a little bit about some of the bigger actions that you're taking to just make sure you're at least keeping up with sell, sell through demand?
Jim Loree: Yes. So I mean, it's fairly straightforward, in the sense that it's batteries, semiconductors. We don't have resin shortages, per se. So, some I know some manufacturers are facing resin shortages. That's not our issue. Batteries, I think we have pretty much solved the problem that if the second half, if the second half growth accelerates beyond the guidance. First of all, we're good at the guidance level. And if we're only talking about would upside ever be constrained, batteries, no issue. And I made a trip to Asia, specifically to free up battery capacity for the second half. And we were successful in that regard. So batteries are no issue and it just comes down to semiconductors and how many hundreds of millions of dollars of more upside versus what's in the guidance as it relates to revenue can we achieve before we start running into shortages. And we're working on that issue as well. And we think we have some ability to make headway on that as in that regard as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hey, good morning, everybody. I know a lot of work with execution. It's, it's remarkable. I wanted to shift from the cost side to the revenue side, and you touched on some of the share gain that you've seen, including the online channel where I guess that kind of accelerates penetration to new markets. And I wonder, whatever additional color you're willing to give on the time, whether this is sent globally online is it continuing to shift. And maybe just for those of us who don't know, the markets as well, when you gain share in EM, or even in Europe, are you are you winning against other global players that, maybe a year or two or three behind you? Or, maybe more winning against smaller players who might have a hard time really ever catching up? I'll stop. Thanks.
Jim Loree: Yes, I think our e-commerce strategy was born about 10 years ago, or so when we did the Black & Decker merger with Stanley. And at that time, e-commerce was zero, or close to zero, just a smidge. And year-after-year after year, we worked hard developing that channel after the acquisition or the merger. And last year, we were up in almost $1.8 billion of revenue. And not only did we do it with the major e-commerce player in the United States, but we did it systematically around the globe. And so pretty much everywhere you look we have deep relationships with the big B2B, B2C players, and a flourishing business and that channel shift, that occurred last year, when the percent of revenue went from 12% to 18%. And Tools was truly remarkable. And now, with almost 2x e-commerce growth in the first quarter, that 1.7 billion plus business has incredibly strong prospects globally for this year. And instead of resting on our laurels, and just enjoying that advantage, because we share about a three to one relative market share advantage in that channel, globally. Instead of resting on laurels, we have taken a really significant investments in this channel in beginning of the fourth quarter, third, third, third, fourth quarter of last year and then accelerating into 2021. To the extent that we now have big teams of people working on this project. B2B, B2C around the globe as well as we're starting to go in markets where we are under indexed. So take, for example, China, India, and Germany. And we are investing in D2C capability. And we'll be doing a lot in that regard because those channels are so difficult to penetrate, given the existing share positions of the players that are out there today. So I would say that the share gains are coming from the major power tools, players and other tools, and then maybe in hand tools, is where the minor where local players. And I think that's going to continue, we'll see, we'll see how the e-commerce investments grow in the industry over time, and I would expect them to, but right now, we have a big first mover advantage, and we are pressing the accelerator to the floor to make sure that we sustain that advantage for as long as possible.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Your line is open.
Markus Mittermaier: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Jim Loree: Morning.
Markus Mittermaier: Morning. Could actually ask the question on security, and especially on the common from France up 17%, Europe up 4% in that data driven product solutions business? What exactly is up? And if there are near term kind of COVID beneficiary that you see? Or is that something that could really make a dent in overall security segment growth here going forward? Thank you.
Jim Loree: Sure, Marcus. Yes, we actually holding up France as an example. And that's why I use that, in my comments is really what the business could be. Because they've taken the SaaS solutions, which really drive a lot of value with the customers were. So it's taking data from video analytics, and doing analysis and really helping our customers run their business more efficiently and effectively. And so they're ahead of the rest of the business in the geographies of electronic security. And they've been aggressively rolling this out. And they've, they've used the pandemic as an opportunity to work with our customers. To help them with the areas I described to ensure they achieved higher levels of productivity. They make better business decisions around in the case of if it's a retail operation, where their products are located in a store, when they do discounting and revenue and sales opportunities, etcetera. So this is a great pilot example of what the business can achieve. And then the North American business and the Nordics business in particular, is gaining some traction in this space as well. They're probably three or four quarters behind where France is, but we really see this as an exciting opportunity to continue to transform the business and a great pilot and as an example of what can be done.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open
Nicole DeBlase: Yes, good morning guys.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Nicole DeBlase: [Indiscernible] inflation discussion? How should we think about the carryover impact at this point to 2022, both with respect to the activity action that you guys plan to put into place perhaps put into place to offset a third?
Jim Loree: Perfect Nicole. So as we highlighted earlier, we give you the 21 number. It's yes, I'd say it's the equivalent maybe $150 million to $200 million of potential pressure in 2022. There is a bit of a topic out there of is this inflation going to continue, because there has been some supply disruptions. But right now we're going with the mindset that it will. And accordingly, that's why we're working on the pricing actions to get the benefit. You'll see this year but, next year, you'll actually have a potential scenario where you actually have more benefits than we have head wins.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Alaei Homan [ph] on for Mike, congrats on the results. And thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about your sense for your POS in Tools & Storage relative to the underlying market and whether that delta is widening? So in other words, how much of the strong POS could be related to you gaining share versus an underlying continuing strong market?
Jim Loree: Yes, I mean, the POS continues to be very robust, and it's in those numbers that we provided back in January in that range and the trends continue. And so we, we believe that we're gaining very significant share, but there also is a pretty strong market demand as well, that's occurring right now. And so it's difficult to gauge exactly at this stage, in the short window, how much is share gain versus market growth. But I think it's more slanted towards share gain than it is market growth at this stage. And, and so I think that's the right way to think about it, though, the proof will be in the pudding, two or three quarters from now when we're able to look at what the actual GDP performance was, and what the performance was for certain trends in the tool industry. But I believe that if you look at these rates right now, probably at least half of it is related to share gains, if not more.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ross Gilardi: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to ask about the second half outlook for tools and storage, you took it up, but it's still down. And just really do you feel like you've got to have an inevitable contraction at some point in the next 12 to 18 months, just because the comps and because the markets running so hot, that's that's really more of a timing issue, or could we just be in the beginning of a multiyear sustained expansion? And then just the second part to that? Did you push the four to five week restock into the second half? And essentially leave the minus 7% to 12% underlying for the back half on change? I wasn't sure if I was interpreting your formal remarks properly.
Lee Mcchesney: Yes, I will. And that second part of the question we, we did that we just we put the benefit of the inventory restock in the back half of the year. And but we did not change the underlying demand assumption from January. So that's the, that's really the opportunity as we progress through the next 90 days, and we provide an update to all of you in July, where are where are we at that stage? And I think that's the big opportunity in front of us which leads a little bit into the first part of your question that I personally, ask Jim to comment on this as well, because I know he has a strong point of view as well. I really think this is a robust market, we're going to see for a while. And I think when you look at all the different dynamics that are happening in various geographies, and the recovery coming out of the pandemic, people are still going to have a very intense focus on their homes, because many of us will continue to work in a hybrid environment, even when we get back to an office on a on a part time basis. So you want to have an environment at home that really is sufficient to meet the needs of both work and personal habits and behaviors. And then you have things like infrastructure, which are just, massive bills across the globe. I mean, we tend to talk about the U.S. as an area where there could be a potential large infrastructure investment, but there's a lot of other major countries, really, thinking about doing the same thing over the next 12 months to 24 months. So you can see a significant influx into the economy from that as well, both in the U.S. and globally. So I sit here and wonder, is there really a dip coming in the next 6 months to 12 months? And when the more I think about it, the more I feel like that we're going to continue to see this strong demand and growth continue. Obviously, I don't think we're going to grow 40% to 50%, every quarter for the next three years. But I do think there's a path for growth for the next two to three years. Jim?
Jim Loree: Yes, I think you've covered it, very well done. But the only thing I would say is I, I think we're going to be able to solidify the base, and then get back to a more normal, kind of 5% to 10% kind of growth type environment after that. That's my best guess right now, just based on, everything I know about the secular trends in particular. You think of what all the different things we mentioned a number of them. But the resurgence of DIY, there's a whole generation of people now that have become familiar with DIY. We have a whole generation of people that are using DeWalt [Ph] Black & Decker, and other Craftsman, other tools that will continue to add to their collections. We have the reconnection with home and garden that Don referenced. Outdoor seems to be the electrification seems to be taken off in a big way. And of course, we'll enjoy electrifying the small gas engine market, when we do the MTD acquisition, which is in our planning assumptions for the second half of this year, in terms of executing the option, and we don't know when that will close and when that closes, not necessarily in our guidance. And then there's the urban exodus. There was a big article in the Wall Street Journal front page today about that. So this whole notion of gradual exodus from urban centers into suburban and rural areas, there's a tremendous amount of home improvement and home sales that go on as a result of that. And that is a generational thing as well. And, and on and on and on. So I just believe the base is preservable. I think our forecast for the second half, is on the conservative side. And in all likelihood, we'll see that base preserved in the second half and my my view, but we have some of the other uncertainties out there relative to inflation and other things that I think we took a very prudent approach to our guidance, we had a great increase. And, just the share gain in general with the company and our e-commerce, our e-commerce share, which is definitely an on-going, an on-going phenomenon. So on balance, I think anybody that's looking for a big contraction in 2022 is probably going to miss the boat. And we'll see.
Operator: Thank you. I now turn like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for any closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if they have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-28 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2020 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2020 fourth quarter and full-year earnings conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don, will review our 2020 fourth quarter and full-year results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Dennis and good morning. Today we issued record fourth quarter results marking an outstanding close to a very dynamic and successful year. As I mentioned in our 2020 shareholder letter, we expected the operating environment of the 2020s to be one of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity or VUCA for short. Lest we had any thought of easing into that construct over time. Like others we were thrust into action as the pandemic roared onto the scene in March and April. And as for many companies, the early days of the pandemic brought into focus the first rung of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. We quickly established pandemic era tactical priorities. First, protect the health and safety of our employees and supply chain partners. Secondly, ensure the continuity of our operations and financial stability. And third, do what we can, or could to mitigate the impact of the virus in our communities. We undertook a myriad of actions consistent with those priorities, including the implementation of intensive companywide safety protocols, including mandatory masks from day one, significant liquidity enhancements, cost reductions, some temporary, some permanent as well as a substantial increase in our philanthropy, both in dollar terms and in-kind. We asked our people to be guided by our purpose. For those who make the world, we emphasized our three simple leadership principles which include creating clarity, inspiring engagement, and growing and delivering. Our people, while dealing with a personal hardships and challenges characteristic of this era, responded beautifully to our lead. Amidst four weeks of collapsing sell-out revenue in April, we were hunkered down, ready to ride out the storm. And then suddenly in the last week of April, and on into the summer months, an abrupt and very positive phenomenon emerged in the tools business. Our end users, many of them homebound, with time on their hands, discovered and/or rediscovered DIY projects, both indoors and outdoors. We enjoyed a surge in North American retail of a magnitude never before experienced. By June, POS was running 30% to 40% greater than the prior-year. E-commerce growth exploded at levels even higher than that. Unfortunately, both we and our channel partners had solid inventory positions at the onset of the demand. By May, we were ramping-up our factories to extraordinary levels. By the third quarter the demand trend had extended to Europe and other markets around the world albeit at somewhat lower levels but still in strong double-digit territory. The second half of 2020 proved to be an all-out test of our supply chain resiliency and ability to serve the growth. Customer inventory levels have been substantially reduced by mid-year and our global factories were running at historic levels just to keep up with the POS demand and they still are. We faced rolling labor shortages, supplier issues and various arbitrary government edicts in jurisdictions all over the globe. However, we were able to prevail and operate continuously with only minor exceptions and along the way, we've moved forward with significant capacity expansion actions for both power and hand tools and we look forward to serving continued growth in the future. 2020 was by far the most difficult backdrop we've ever faced. But we were prepared for volatility and our people rose to meet the challenges. Fortunately, we went into it with strength and have stayed strong for the duration. Back in 2016, we committed to a vision that embodied purpose-driven performance. We built a company that is anchored by our supportive people oriented culture, striving to deliver top quartile shareholder return to become known as one of the world's great innovators, and to elevate an already strong commitment to ESG and corporate social responsibility. We demonstrated in 2020 that when corporations like ours put people first and work to have a positive impact on society at large, the result can be extraordinary resilience, which benefits our shareholders through outstanding growth, cash flow, margin expansion, and ESG. And that is the story of 2020. On the heels of an excellent third quarter, the fourth quarter was the pinnacle of our 2020 performance, and we enter 2021 stronger than ever. Now I'll take a moment and recap the 4Q numbers which demonstrate the power of our momentum as we enter 2021. Revenues were up 19% to $4.4 billion, with organic growth of 16%. This was led once again by Tools & Storage, which had organic revenue up an impressive 25%. Our total company operating margin rate excluding charges was a fourth quarter record at 16.5%, up 290 basis points from prior-year with volume leverage, productivity, cost actions, price and margin resiliency initiatives all contributing. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $3.29, up 51% versus prior-year. And now let's turn to the full-year. Revenues were $14.5 billion up 1% with 10% organic growth in the second half more than offsetting the first half pandemic-related issues. Our full-year operating margin rate expanded 110 basis points to 14.6%, attributable to strong cost control, productivity on margin resiliency initiatives, and price. Adjusted EPS for the year was $9.04 an 8% increase versus 2019 especially remarkable, when considering our original pre-pandemic guidance mid-point last January was $8.90 a share. We converted the strong sales and margin results along with just over a half turn of working capital improvement into record cash flow. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion for the year, $1.7 billion for the year, an all-time record for the company, up 55% versus 2019 with a conversion rate of 136%. And lastly, I'm happy to report that we successfully exceeded all of our five-year medium term environmental health and safety goals established in 2015. We targeted a 20% reduction of our energy consumption, our carbon emissions, our water use and our waste generated in our facilities, and more than attained each one of those goals. In addition, we significantly improved our recycling and use of renewable energy and achieved our safety goals. When I became CEO in 2016, we updated our vision to elevate our commitment to social responsibility. Achievement of these goals is an important milestone in our journey to execute on our 2030 sustainability strategy, more goals and more milestones ahead as we continue on this March. So where do we go from here? In a world of elevated uncertainty, here are a few observations to simplify and clarify our point of view on that for 2021 and 2022. Without question, tools and outdoor demand is on a roll, and we think it will be for some time to come. Benefiting from a series of exogenous factors including first a secular surge in global DIY driven by the consumers rediscovery of Home and Garden. Secondly, a massive acceleration of the global shift to e-commerce within our channels, which plays to our strength as the global tools leader in e-commerce. And third, a cyclical boom in North America Home Improvement driven by increasing new and pre-owned home sales associated largely with household formation and the Urban Exodus. And then there is the need to rebuild channel inventory levels, which we believe are at least four weeks lower than desirable. Our Tools business has never been stronger or better positioned to gain share and we have consistently grown organically and gained share every year since the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker 11 years ago. Our unmatched array of iconic brands, market leading innovation, combined with our scale and organizational agility continues to support that investment thesis. Total company operating margin reached new heights in the second half of 2020, breaking through the 15% threshold at 17.7% and 16.5% in 3Q and 4Q respectively. This is a significant increase of about 300 basis points over prior-year and it is not a coincidence, it derives from an intentional confluence of tight cost management, volume leverage, price mix management, and our margin resiliency initiative. The latter applies cutting edge digital technologies to optimize margin performance across multiple value pools. Skeptics point out that the third quarter benefited from cost reductions, some of which were admittedly temporary in nature. These Skeptics now have to deal with the fourth quarter in which the 16.5% includes the vast majority of temporary costs such as furloughs, four-day workweeks, executive salary reductions, and benefit deferrals back in the run rate. This was accomplished as we began to fund significant new investments and growth initiatives including major thrusts into e-commerce, revitalizing the Black & Decker brand, security, health and safety and outdoor products. And although the second half 2021 Tools growth comp is difficult, we believe it is manageable, and we're predicting full-year total company organic growth of approximately 6% at the mid-point; with a super strong first half and a modest negative in the back half yielding the 6% mid-point, which is the high-end of our long-term growth objective for that measure. Our strong share momentum aided by numerous growth catalysts such as Flexvolt, Craftsman, Atomic, Xtreme, Power Detect and E-commerce should not be underestimated. On top of this, there is an industrial related portion of Tools that is in the midst of a cyclical rebound as we enter 2021, along with about $4 billion of Industrial, which includes engineered fastening automotive, and the Security segment revenue, which was negative in 2020 and all those are expected to be positive in the aggregate in 2021. So for all these reasons, and more as Don will cover in his remarks, our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance is introduced at $9.70 to $10.30 a share. At the mid-point, this is $10, up 11% which is a very good place to start our journey into 2021. And while it is too early, way too early to guess at what market conditions might be in 2022, we stand to benefit from our multi-year relationship with MTD and our optionality to acquire the remaining 80% at a very attractive multiple with a window that begins to open in July of this year which brings me to a brief update on MTD. Our current planning assumption calls for the exercise of our MTD option and the potential addition of up to $3 billion of revenue from the MTD transaction in 2022. And just to clarify, we expect to implement or exercise the option in late 2021 and begin to recognize revenue subsequent to regulatory approvals, and hopefully beginning in 2022. The lawn and garden category is experiencing similar benefits to Tools from the consumers' reconnection with the home and MTD LTM revenues now approximate $2.6 billion with a very strong second half revenue performance in the books comparable to our Tools business. Additionally, MTD continues to make progress on multiple opportunities to generate operational efficiency and margin improvement delivering a 6% operating margin in 2020, with momentum coming into the 2021 season, and plenty of runway ahead for further improvement. The transaction was structured in a financially prudent way whereby we purchased 20% of the company at an 11 times multiple with the option to purchase the remaining 80% anytime during a 10-year window beginning this July. MTD’ incremental EBITDA improvements since our initial purchase is shared 50:50 and is thus valued at 5.5 times, which provides us the ability to acquire a market leader in outdoor power equipment at an all-in multiple at the time of option execution likely to approximate 7 to 8 times. We're excited by the multiple levers to accelerate growth and margin expansion with this acquisition. In addition to the initial revenue contribution upon consolidation, we see additional organic growth opportunities in the pro-outdoor equipment market as well as to drive electric powered and autonomous mower offerings, while employing our successful commercial model to fully leverage our portfolio of brands and channels. We're also working on a multi-year roadmap to achieve 15% operating margin in the category. Likely some say, however, we believe we're up to the challenge. I remind the naysayers that Black & Decker's operating margin was below 6% in the year before acquisition, and the very same team that addressed that opportunity is still on the field today. We continue to be encouraged by MTD's innovation and product development pipeline as well as their progress on improving profitability and we're excited about this future combination. Even before exercising our option, we're bringing this vision to life in 2021 with SBD and MTD, each independently launching a series of new products under the DeWalt, Craftsman and Black & Decker brands that are hitting the market now across the gas and electric power spectrum. A few notable examples MTD brings world-class innovation in writing and zero turn mowers and through a licensing arrangement will launch a new lineup of DeWalt branded gas powered professional mowers that are now beginning to roll-out at one of our major U.S. retailers. In addition, we have designed, developed and are launching new cordless 20 volt DeWalt walk-behind mowers, also with strong listings that will be made in the USA with global materials in MTDs Tupelo, Mississippi facility. MTD continues to expand its outdoor offering into new categories with Craftsman under license. New to market this year will be an impressive lineup of zero turn gas mowers as well as gas powered solutions in writing and walk-behind mowers. Concurrently, SBD will expand our battery and electric powered offerings and push mowers power washers, and handheld products such as chainsaws, trimmers and blowers. Lastly, as a part of our e-commerce focused brand refresh with Black & Decker -- of Black & Decker, MTD will launch a new lineup of gas handheld products under license and we'll launch new electric offerings including an autonomous robotic mower in Europe. As you can see, we've been busy working our partnership with MTD and there is a lot to be excited about that and for 2021, these opportunities are planned to deliver more than $100 million of organic growth for SBD as well as support additional growth for MTD. With broad coverage across gas powered products for MTD and electric and battery powered categories for SBD, we're just starting to tap into the significant potential ahead of us. And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan to cover the fourth quarter and our 2021 guidance. Don?
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. We're incredibly pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance which closed out an amazing back half to 2020. So now, I'd like to review our business segment results for the fourth quarter. Tools & Storage delivered an exceptional 25% total and organic revenue growth with volume up 23% and price contributing an additional two points. All regions continued to benefit from exceptionally strong revenue trends related to the consumers' reconnection with home and garden. E-commerce continued to be very strong. We had a strong holiday season, and a robust lineup of new products and innovation. The operating margin rate for this segment was another outstanding result at 20.7%, up 420 basis points versus the prior-year as volume, productivity; cost control and price were modestly offset by new growth investments. As the revenue outlook improved during 2020, we released incremental SG&A investments to further the development of our brands via digital marketing, increased distribution capacity, and added commercial resources to support our business model in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. We believe much of these investments will drive further organic growth in share gains in 2021 and 2022. Now let's look at some of the geographies within Tools & Storage. North America was up a robust 27% organically. Retail continued to see exceptionally strong POS, delivering 36% organic growth through a very strong holiday season along with continued momentum in e-commerce. POS growth for the quarter approximated 30% and retailer inventories ended the year slightly below Q3 levels and well below prior-year, an amazing Q4 performance for the Tools & Storage team. And what's incredibly amazing is we still have a channel refill opportunity of four weeks in front of us that will likely materialize in the front part of 2021. The North American commercial and industrial channels continue to experience positive sequential trends, with both posting low single-digit growth this quarter versus declines in Q3. Pure play construction customers within these channels were up mid-teens in Q4 significantly improved from the low single-digit growth last quarter. This trend is clearly another strong signal that professional demand is back and accelerating.  The Tools & Storage European business also had an outstanding fourth quarter as all regions grew, which resulted in 18% organic growth. This performance was led by the UK, Central Europe, Nordics, Benelux and Iberia all up double-digits with France and Italy up mid-single-digits. The team experienced strong revenue growth in both retail brick-and-mortar and e-commerce. Finally, emerging markets delivered an exceptional quarter of organic growth as well up 22% with all regions posting positive revenue trends. We experienced strong construction demand in these markets, and when combined with positive pricing momentum, it supported this robust performance. Latin America was the strongest performer delivering 36% organic growth with all countries up double-digits, while Russia and Turkey had another very strong quarter, also resulting in double-digit growth in these markets. Finally, Asia delivered low single-digit growth led by South Korea and India each up double-digits, which was partially offset by modest declines in China and Southeast Asia. Now let's pivot and look at the Tools & Storage SPUs. Power Tools delivered 32% organic growth, benefiting from the home and construction trends mentioned previously, as well as strong commercial execution for the holiday season, and new product introductions. We continue to see strong share gains from our new innovations in Flexvolt, Atomic and Xtreme which now represent over $600 million of annual revenue on a combined basis. Now to our product tools business delivered 29% organic growth as these categories continue to benefit from the consumer reconnection with the home as well, as new DeWalt and Craftsman cordless products were launched in 2020. The Hand Tools and accessory and storage business delivered an impressive 15% organic growth this quarter. This was supported by new product launches, the strong performance in emerging markets, and Mac tools combined with the rebound in professional construction demand I just previously mentioned. In summary, an amazing quarter and an incredibly successful year for Tools & Storage. The team remained focused and responded with agility to the pandemic, and quickly pivoted to fulfill the surging demand that emerged in the second half of the year. This effort was remarkable and helped them deliver record levels of growth and margin expansion during one of the most challenging operating environments in our lifetimes. Great job by the entire team, we thank them for their intense and focused efforts. I'm really excited to see the encore performance in 2021. Turning to Industrial, total growth was 10%, which included an 11 point contribution from the CAM acquisition and two points from currency. This was partially offset by a 2% volume driven organic decline and a negative 1% impact from the divestiture of a non-core product line in oil and gas. It was great to see continued improving trend sequentially as the organic decline in Q3 of 18% improved to negative 2% in the fourth quarter, a trend which is positioning the segment for organic growth in 2021. The operating margin rate increased 110 basis points year-over-year to 14.7% as the benefits from productivity and restructuring cost actions more than offset the impact of the lower volume. Diving a bit deeper into this segment, engineered fastening revenues were down 2% organically, as growth in automotive was offset by an improved but still declining general industrial end market. Automotive was up mid-single-digits behind high teens growth in automotive fasteners, which was partially offset by continued declines in systems as most new capital investment decisions related to new car models continue to be on hold. However, Global Light vehicle production continues to improve and we remain well-positioned to outpace the underlying market with content gains in the fastener portion of this business. Industrial fasteners declined high-single-digits in the fourth quarter, the recovery in the Industrial markets continues to progress and we once again saw sequential improvement. Our infrastructure businesses declined 5% organically as positive attachment tools growth was more than offset by reduced pipeline construction in oil and gas. And finally turning to Security. Total revenue was down 3% with a 3% positive impact from currency, while price and acquisitions each contributed 1%. This was offset by a five point decline in volume and a negative 3% due to the divestitures announced last quarter. North America declined 5% as growth in healthcare was offset by lower installations in automatic doors and commercial electronic security. These businesses are serving markets that are still slowly improving from the pandemic impact and it also faced a difficult 7% growth comparable in 2019. European Security organic growth was relatively flat as they experienced solid growth in France from the new growth initiatives which began to take root. This performance was offset by lower volume in the UK related to the various intense lockdowns from the pandemic. Our focus on health and safety initiatives such as touchless doors, contact tracing and healthcare solutions are building momentum and generated about 150 basis points of growth in Q4. With a healthy backlog, a continued recovering market, and the addition of these new solutions, we're optimistic that Security can return to growth in the front half and for the full-year of 2021. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate was 11.2% flat versus the prior-year as price and cost control were offset by the impact from lower volume and growth investments. Now let's take a look at our very strong free cash flow performance on the next page. As you can see, we were able to leverage our strong operational performance in the back half to generate a record full-year free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of $593 million versus the prior-year and a free cash flow conversion of 136% of net income. This result was driven by the strong growth in Tools & Storage, our companywide cost actions, and lower capital spending delivering significant improvement in cash earnings. Now as it relates to working capital, we delivered 10.4 working capital turns, up 0.6 turns year-over-year reflecting the strong revenue performance and leveraging the SBD operating model to drive working capital efficiency across the company. With the strong cash generation and inclusion of the excess cash on the balance sheet, which amounted to $1.4 billion at year-end, we believe we-re well-positioned from a leverage perspective heading into 2021, a fantastic outcome. Now we'd like to discuss our views on 2021, as improving channel and markets visibility has enabled us to reinstate guidance. Beginning with Slide 10, I'd like to dive deeper into several of our 2021 organic growth assumptions. We're experiencing a fast start to the first quarter as strong market trends in Tools & Storage continue combined with improving Industrial and Security markets. Therefore, we expect organic revenue growth to approximate 21% to 26% for the company in the first quarter of 2021. Tools & Storage is the largest contributor of this strong performance and our plans assume a 1Q organic growth range of 30% to 40%. Underpinning this assumption is the continuation of the strong demand trends, the potential for customer inventories to start to move back to historical levels, and finally, we have an easier comp since Q1 2019 had the beginning -- Q1 2020 had the beginning impacts from the pandemic. Growth continues to be broad-based with all regions contributing to very strong outlook. POS in U.S. retail through the first three weeks of January has remained in a similar band that we experienced during this December and we're assuming this trend will continue through the remainder of the quarter. We're also seeing continued positive momentum in the commercial and industrial channels, Tools & Storage European and emerging markets continue to experience strong momentum as well. And we're currently expecting demand trends in Q1 that are similar to the fourth quarter we just completed. Another way to look at the 30% to 40% Tools & Storage organic growth assumption is that it represents approximately $600 million to $800 million of Q1 organic growth. January, which is historically a very slow month for Tools & Storage, is on track to three or five weeks to deliver $400 million of growth in the month. Additionally, February and March were both negative comps in 2020. Therefore, we believe with a continuation of market demand trends and a modest contribution from safety stock increases across our global customer base, this represents a very strong but reasonably balanced expectation for the first quarter. Turning to Industrial, our first quarter assumes a decline of 5% up to flat organically. To deconstruct this a bit, at the mid-point of this range, we're calling for high single-digit to low double-digit growth in both Attachment Tools, and within automotive engineered fastening, which in total represents a little more than half of this segment. Supporting this Attachment Tools experienced a 50% year-over-year increase in Q4 backlog. In automotive, this assumes a moderation of fastener volume growth to low double-digits, and a less severe decline on easier comps for our systems business. We expect our Industrial fastener business to continuous sequential improvement and be relatively flat. Offsetting these positive factors in Q1, we anticipate steep declines in oil and gas and aerospace. CAM is included in the organic growth calculation partway through the first quarter. As both of these businesses are longer cycle, they held up relatively better when the initial impacts of the pandemic occurred, and therefore will be challenged in the front half of 2021. Turning to Security, our plan assumes for a range of flat to up low single-digits organically in Q1. Exit trends in December for this business were strong, and the backlog ended the year up double-digits, which provides a good setup as we enter Q1, particularly as the easier comps begin in the month of March. Additionally, the business is focused on continuing to stimulate demand with our existing and new health and safety solutions that emerge from the pandemic and started to generate revenue prior to the end of the year. Turning to the right side of this slide, I want to touch on the full-year growth assumptions for all segments and the first and second half planning assumptions for Tools & Storage. As you would expect, we're planning for a very strong first half of the year. We're expecting the strong trends I just talked through for Q1 to moderate in the second quarter but remain quite strong. The continued market recoveries in Security and Industrial, strong demand in Tools and relatively easy year-over-year comps positions the company for an organic growth range of 19% to 24% for the first quarter. For the second half, we have moderated our assumptions to incorporate the difficult comps created by the strong second half 2020 growth in Tools. While we're pushing for more growth and share gains, we felt it was prudent to set expectations for a decline of 3% to 8% organically for the company. This is how we have constructed our overall range of 4% to 8% organic growth for the full-year for Stanley Black & Decker. For Tools & Storage, we're also assuming full-year growth of 4% to 8% which includes organic growth of 27% to 32% in the first half for the reasons previously mentioned, and a decline of 7% to 12% in the back half. While the growth in Tools is retracting versus 2020 in the back half, the range is up 4% to 10% versus the back half of 2019. This is a reasonable two-year assumption based on the historical growth numbers we have seen for this business. That being said, this is a short cycle business and we are ensuring the supply chain can accommodate second half scenarios that are improved versus this range. The potential scenario we must be prepared for is robust Tools & Storage markets that continue for the majority of 2021. We have not assumed this will occur in our guidance, but we will be ready to respond if this does evolve in the coming months. For Industrial, we're assuming 2% to 6% growth in 2021 with a stronger performance in the front half due to the easier comps. Engineered fastening and Attachment Tools have a lot of momentum and we're well-positioned to capitalize upon the recovery as it unfolds in 2021. As it relates to oil and gas and aerospace, we expect they will remain a significant headwind to growth in the front half. But this eases a bit as we move into the back half. Finally, for Security, we see a range for 4% to 6% growth for the full-year. This is fairly consistent across the two halves, as the front half has easier comps and the back half carries a stronger level of growth from the ramp-up of our health and safety focus growth initiatives. We're excited by the prospects for these tech enabled products, which contributed 1.5 points of growth in the fourth quarter and could represent up to $100 million of revenue in 2021. So in summary, we're expecting 4% to 8% organic full-year growth with growth in every segment. We're well-positioned to capture market recoveries and share gains in each of our businesses and feel this is a balanced range that acknowledges the current environment. We'll continue to watch our markets and will be prepared if the back half assumption proves to be conservative. Now I'll summarize the remaining guidance assumptions on Slide 11. We're reinitiating guidance in 2021, with an adjusted earnings per share range of $9.70 to $10.30, up approximately 11% versus prior-year at the mid-point. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $9.15 to $9.85, inclusive of various one-time charges related to facility moves, deal and integration costs and functional transformation initiatives. This range is $0.40 wider than our traditional guide, recognizing that while the visibility has improved, the operating environment remains dynamic. Since I just covered organic growth, let's jump right into the cost structure consideration. We expect $125 million of carryover cost savings net of the reversal of temporary actions from the cost program we implemented in the second quarter of 2020. These actions will primarily benefit the first quarter with a modest benefit in the second quarter. From an inflation perspective, we currently see the potential for approximately $75 million of headwind primarily associated with steel, base metals, transportation, electronic components and resins. Keep in mind; we generally lock-in our supply agreements one to two quarters out. So the timing of this headwind is back half weighted. Partially offsetting this headwind to the tailwind of roughly $45 million related to foreign exchange. Therefore, at this point in time, we have included $30 million of a headwind associated with these externally driven cost inputs. Should we see additional pressure in commodities or should currency reverse, we'll utilize our productivity programs and pricing to neutralize the pressure over time. However, specific to 2021, as a reminder, we have $100 million to $150 million of margin resiliency benefit as a contingency, which is not included in our guidance. This contingency will assist in mitigating new headwinds in these areas during 2020 if they emerge. Finally, we have disclosed our current full-year assumptions for the significant below the line items and our expectation for pre-tax M&A and other charges to assist with your modeling. Turning to cash flow, we expect another strong performance in 2021 with free cash flow conversion approximating GAAP net income. Underpinning this expectation is capital expenditures of approximately 3% of net sales. In addition, we will utilize the SBD operating model to drive efficiencies in working capital to deliver turns improvement. Lastly, we expect the first quarter's earnings per share to be approximately 24% of the full-year performance, which is primarily driven by operating leverage on the organic growth assumptions I walked through for Q1 and the $150 million of benefits from the carryover cost actions we have implemented. So in summary, for the total company, we expect 4% to 8% organic growth, and 7% to 14% adjusted EPS expansion. A strong forecast that represents a balance due recognizing the dynamic operating environment, but also incorporates more difficult comps and inflation assumptions into the plan, while delivering healthy margin expansion and EPS growth for the full-year. The organization remains focused on meeting the needs of several ongoing strong and sequentially improving markets. Leveraging our organic growth catalysts as well, executing margin resiliency, and generating strong free cash flow, while not losing sight of ensuring we keep our employees safe, and assisting our communities through the remainder of this pandemic. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim to close out with a summary of our prepared remarks. Jim?
Jim Loree: Thanks, Don. Very clear, very transparent, very exciting. In summary, 2020 was an extraordinary year for Stanley Black & Decker. This performance was possible due to the agility, passion and dedication of our people combined with a strong cultural and financial foundation. It's hard to pick one element to get most enthused about given the 2020 performance, especially in the second half as well as the improving outlook. Is it the growth, the margin expansion or the extraordinary cash flow and the potential for more? Is it a demonstrated resilience of this purpose-driven company? Or is it the enormous potential given the way the company is positioned for 2021 and 2022? In my view, it's all of the above. We're energized by the existence of a multi-year runway for growth and profitability improvement. The shareholder value creation potential is certainly compelling over the medium to long-term. And while pursuing these shareholder rewards, we're also mindful of our responsibility to society and the multiple stakeholders that we serve and our sustained commitment to ESG and social responsibility is strong, authentic, and we continue to elevate it over time. And as you can see, there's a lot to be excited about with our MTD partnership and for 2021, these opportunities are planned to deliver more than $100 million of organic growth for SBD as well as to support additional growth for MTD. So I want to thank everybody. It's been an exciting year. There's a lot of really great things ahead. And now I'll turn it over to Dennis. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great, thanks Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Congrats on beating your $8.90 guidance, you got there in a slightly different way, but well done there. So on MTD, just wanted to just touch on that. There's a bit of confusion out there just want to clarify MTD is not in your guidance at all. Let me just clarify that. And then on the 7 to 8 times EBITDA, updates on a trailing EBITDA, or would that be a forward EBITDA? Just want to clarify that as well. And then just my real question is on the road to mid-teens margins, what do you think are the biggest drivers of that move? And any kind of time scale on that would be helpful? Thanks.
Jim Loree: Okay, thank you, Nigel. To be very clear, there's no acquisition of MTD in the guidance. There's some licensing income associated with some of the opportunities I described in the comments. There's some organic growth in Stanley based on some collaboration with MTD on products that we'll be selling through our own channels and our own brands. But there is no, nothing related to the acquisition in the guidance. The multiple is going to be a trailing multiple, because that's how the option is basically priced. It's based on a trailing EBITDA. And so that's where the 7 to 8 times comes from. And as far as the road to mid-teens operating margin, it's our objective to get the operating margins up to around somewhere around eight-ish percent next year, maybe a little higher if the volume kind of comes through the way we think. And so if we start from say a base of maybe 8% to 10%, there is a whole series of cost reduction value creation activities that exists in a plan, if you will, it's a somewhat high-level plan, because we're not able to get into super detailed diligence at this point. But we have been working with a major consulting firm to come up with some point of view on how we can get to a number something in the neighborhood of probably $50 million to $100 million of additional margin improvement that is not being implemented by MTD for various reasons. One, they may not have the appetite for it, or they may not have the capability to do it. But we have some ideas that are pretty specific in that regard. That gets us up into like the 12-ish kind of zone. And then from 12 to 15, it really is going to be a function of really leveraging the synergies between the companies, the channel synergies, the brand synergies, the growth and also a major thrust into the professional channel. I must say that having spent some time at MTD in September, I was blown away by the quality of their innovation pipeline, the collaboration to the extent we've been allowed to do that through based on certain legal constraints and so on, but the collaboration that we have been able to do in terms of lightweighting, electrification, autonomy, those types of things. It's really, really impressive. And what they've done on their own is impressive too. So the combination of all those things, I expect that we'll make a major thrust into the pro-channel, the products are going to be very, very strong. And when we start branding those products with some of our major brands such as DeWalt, I think there's going to be a really compelling value proposition for the channel and the end user to carry those products and buy those products. So that's kind of where we're going with MTD. You can start to see the -- in the marketplace in 2021, some of the call them collaborations around just the edges without really being 100% owned by us. And the ability for us to generate $100 million of organic growth, just with some, some modest collaboration, in terms of commercial and product is really kind of underlines the potential and the power of this relationship.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you, good morning. Congrats.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Don Allan: Good morning.
Jeff Sprague: Hard to say where to start, you guys could have just maybe dropped the mike and ended the call. But I was wondering, I guess it's for Don, but maybe elaborate a little bit more on how we should think about Tools margins going forward. As Jim said, you kind of showed us here with the cost back in the base what you can do. But it sounds like there's some investment coming back in and some other things. So should we be thinking about this kind of 18% to 20% range that I think you were talking about on the Q3 call is kind of a reasonable framework, as we pencil out 2021 here?
Don Allan: Absolutely. I mean we feel even more confident now to kind of confirm what I said in October on the earnings call, that that range does make sense for 2021 between 18% and 20%. And you should see all four quarters in that range. So there shouldn't be a lot of significant variation in that regard. There will be a little bit of investment that we will make. But it's going to be more along the lines of some of the growth initiatives that we started here in 2020 in e-commerce and a few other areas. And so we're going to continue to invest in that space that'll drive additional share gains and more organic growth. So, we feel really positive about how the business positioned itself from a profitability perspective and although the rates are in the back half were over 20%. So we'll see a little bit of a retraction going into next year for the reasons I articulated. I think over the long-term, we feel like it's a business that will continue to progress and improve its profitability over the coming years. It won't just be a one or two-year phenomena.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Your line is open.
Markus Mittermaier: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the detail. Maybe in recent weeks, there's obviously been some concern around raw materials. And Don, you mentioned the $100 million to $150 million contingency that is not part of guidance. Just want to make sure that I understood that right that is not part of the guidance. And wondering how quickly, you could put that into effect? And also, what are you seeing up to-date so far on the raw material side? Thank you.
Don Allan: Yes. I'll start with the raw material part of that question. I mean, we saw these trends kind of emerge in October timeframe, November. And in the categories I mentioned, of steel, resin, electronic components. And so that that is going to continue for a period of time, right now, we have $75 million of an increase in those types of categories in our guidance for 2021. I don't think it's going to radically deviate from that, it could go up a little bit as the year goes on. But we do have to keep in mind the way that we structure our contracts, it usually takes a good six months for that to really impact our P&L, which gives us time to respond with pricing actions, if that makes sense or productivity or whatever the case may be. And then that kind of helps us mitigate that over a longer period of time, maybe over a multi-year period of time, those actions. The margin resiliency program is an annual program that we started about three years ago, which was built on, let's look at the different areas of our company, the functions, the operations teams, how we price our products, et cetera and use technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Advanced Data Analytics, and make better decisions in those particular areas to drive efficiency and effectiveness. And we've seen that over the last few years the ongoing process of the team that's been created and the technology that they use; we have about 100 people that are focused on this full time in the company drives about $100 million to $150 million of annual value. Now we could put that in our P&L and make it part of our guidance. But we think it's more prudent involved for times like this to have it outside the guidance as a contingency. And so when new things come your way that are headwinds, you have an offset. These things are underway, they're in process, and so they're driving value this month in all 12 months out of the year. And so if the headwinds don't come, you get the opportunity to position yourself to outperform. And we think it's a very balanced way to approach guidance in the way to operate in this world, given the level of volatility that we've all seen in the last four years, but in particular, the last 12 months.
Jim Loree: And I just wanted to comment, too, on the inflation perception, because it was really interesting, sitting here and listening to some of the feedback from investors over -- from the last couple of weeks about this inflation concern. And we were scratching our heads to some extent, because we've had inflation more often more years than not over the 20 plus years I've been here. And we've always been able to offset a part of it with price and new product in development, new product introductions, and so on. And then there's always productivity that has come through and helped offset the rest of it, and actually given us some decent margin accretion in certain years, even when there was inflation. And so this reflex reaction that, that occurred, which was oh, my gosh, Stanley Black & Decker is inflation prone. It didn't make any sense to us. But then when we thought about it, we realized that if you go back to the 2017, 2018, 2019, kind of timeframe, there was this billion dollars of headwinds that we have all behind us now. And that billion dollars of headwinds was a triad of things, it was the inflation, it was the tariffs, and it was the FX, and a billion dollars was just too big a series of headwinds to just offset with the normal types of offsets that I talked about. So we ended up having to do some restructuring. And by the way, we still generated 6% earnings growth during that timeframe. So it wasn't catastrophic, it was just a lot of work and a lot of pain in order to get through that period, and we did it. But in any one of those, whether it was the FX, or the inflation, or the tariffs, any one of those, we could have handled it easily through our normal contingencies and things like that. But when we put them all together, and that three years in a row, it just -- it became a lot. And so that perception, I think develops. So immediately when the winds of inflation started blowing in the third and fourth quarter, we got this reflex from the investment community. But I think, as of today, I hope that we can put that behind us because it is not a significant material issue to us in 2021.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: Yes, hey, good morning, guys. Nice start.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Tim.
Don Allan: Thanks, Tim.
Tim Wojs: My question really just, I'm curious if there's a way that you could kind of frame or parse out what you're seeing from the DIY and your Pro business. And I know, it's more of an art than a science, particularly in the home center channel, but just kind of curious and we started to hit tougher DIY comps in the second half, if your Pro business, and the Pro channels can help absorb this. So just any color on DIY versus Pro and if there's any acceleration in Pro that fits into your assumptions?
Jim Loree: Well, I did lay out in my remarks, kind of the things that I thought were driving the demand, which is one is a secular shift to DIY with so many people at home and with the home being the focal point, as well as outdoor, being the focal point of people's activities, and the number of projects and the number of people doing projects and doing projects for the first time is at record levels. And I think another thing is the installed base of battery systems is a big deal, with this kind of growth that we have in 2020 and now into 2021. There are going to be more and more first timers or people that have bought new battery systems, investing in additional tools for their battery systems. And frankly, I think when once people discover DIY; it tends to be somewhat addictive. So I think that, we're going to have, it is a secular shift in my opinion, I think the home center CEOs would agree with that. I've heard them talk about that as well. So that's a big deal. Obviously, it abates over time as the comps kind of get tougher in terms of its percentage impact on growth. And what we saw in 2000, what relative to the Pros was in the beginning the Pros like let's say like April/May projects kind of came to a grinding halt for the most part except for the really essential ones and then into the summer, the Pro started coming back and into the third and fourth quarter, you can't even get a contractor in this country anymore if you want one. So at least I've had that experience. I think the contractors are very busy in the resi and both the remodeling and in the new construction areas. They've got a tremendous backlog. I think they're back. I mean, I think that that has played out. So, as we go forward, I think what we're really looking at is more of kind of going up against the comps and getting back to a more normal environment as we get into 2022 and beyond. But it's -- it is one, it is an artist, you say, and it's difficult to really parse in great detail exactly what's happening. But that is our gut feeling instinct based on what we could see here at this point.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Nicole DeBlase: Can you just clear something up with respect to the inflation headwind? Is that just the pure inflation headwind? Or is there any offset from pricing embedded in there? And then secondly, my real question is, can you just talk a little bit about expectations for margins within the other two segments, whether you want to talk about expected incrementals on the volume growth that you set out, however you want to do it, but will be good to get some color there, too.
Don Allan: Yes, the $75 million is growth inflation, doesn't have any price offset in it. And we'll work through those plans as these emerge and decide, where it makes sense for pricing actions and when, but it is a gross number. And so that means, the annualized number is probably 125 to 150, when you think about it. So -- and that's the right magnitude at this stage for these different areas. The areas that really are being hit hard are steel, resin, electronic components, and then battery cells or base metals, if you want to call it, however you want to call it, but those four categories are things that there's a high demand for right now, as we all know. The question is, how long does that demand last? Is there a parts of the economy that are really going strong, and there's other parts of the economy that are not, that have not recovered as well, and the timing of that recovery is going to depend on how the vaccines roll-out, and how we eventually get the herd immunity, and how quickly that occurs. So, we could be seeing a short-term bubble here that maybe moderates for a period of time, or it could be something that continues to grow modestly over multiple years. So time will tell. But I think we've got that in the right box right now. And it's something we can manage going forward with all the levers that I described. The other two segments for profitability improvement, I could -- I could probably give you all kinds of leverage factors. But I think it might be simpler to just say, if you think about the whole company's operating margin, right, we're trying to improve about 50 basis points year-over-year. Tools is trying to improve roughly the same number, maybe a little bit more and so that means Industrial and Security are going to improve about same number too. So I think you can kind of look at a 50, anywhere from 40 to 50 basis point improvement in all three segments, with the net result for the company about 50 basis points for the full-year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hey, appreciate all the detail this morning, especially on the inflation front. So I only have one question. I don't have like three imaginary ones and a real one. Just thinking about the 4% to 8% Tools & Storage growth for the full-year, Jim, I think you gave some parameters around inventory. Seems like it rounds to something in the neighborhood of two points of kind of full-year benefit from replenishment if we're way off with that, let us know. But is the rest of that, kind of evenly split North America and international, I think if I'm taking some of the inputs and making some assumptions that the team play kind of core growth in the U.S. business inclusive of Pro is pretty modest actually stock, is that kind of a fair calibration of the moving pieces?
Jim Loree: Yes. I think it is. It's -- we -- we were talking about four weeks probably is a reasonable number to improve. It is a global number we're talking about because we do see opportunity across the globe, probably heavily, more heavily weighted to North America because we know those inventories are definitely at the very low end of the range of where we like to be. And so maybe 75% to 80% of it is weighted to the U.S. and North America. But I think when you think about the growth that could come with that, it's probably a couple points of growth, maybe two-and-a-half points of growth for the full-year, which means it could be five points in the first half. So that's the magnitude we're talking about. And I think we'll see it start to evolve in Q1. But it might be more heavily weighted to Q2, because the POS just seems really robust in Q1 at this stage.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Alaei Homan [ph] on for Mike. Thanks for taking my question. Just following-up on that. I was wondering if you could talk about your ability from a production and inventory standpoint, to continue to meet the strong POS demand, both in 1Q and just through the remainder of the year ramp-up. And any potential challenges either in capacity or other COVID-19 impacts?
Jim Loree: Yes. We were very fortunate that we were able to really -- first of all, we started the year with a really solid on inventory position, both in the company and in the channels, which are at least in North American channels, where the demand really spiked. And so that, that was helpful, because it was kind of a strange situation, but it got into May. And we were looking at POS that was starting to skyrocket and the orders were not coming in from the channel. And so we ended up building quite a bit of inventory, starting in May, actually over $500 million of inventory we built to serve POS demand that was occurring, and we had to kind of bet that the POS was going to continue at that rate, and it did. And that enabled us to really get ahead of the situation so that we've been. Now, if you look at us at this point in time, we're essentially serving the POS and have them for two quarters now. And we're able to do that. Our end user -- our end users continue to be very, very robust in buying Tools, and our channel partners would like more, they would like their inventory restored. That is the challenge. And so one of the things that we've done, and we were also very fortunate from the standpoint of are made in our "Make Where You Sell" campaign that we've been working on for three or four years had some pretty significant capacity additions, both in Mexico and in North America and in the U.S., and a number of those are either online or coming online, including a major plant in Mexico and a major plant in the U.S. in later in 2021. And so as we look forward, we're not counting on those to necessarily get the inventories to where they need to be in the channels. But we're looking forward to the fact that we will have more capacity in the system significantly more capacity as we get into 2021. So we're not too concerned about that. In the meantime, there's a tremendous amount of inefficiency that's been built into our cost of goods sold here in the second, third and fourth quarters, especially the third and fourth quarters where in order to meet the fill rate objectives and keep the inventories at the levels that we've been able to, we've done a lot of heroic things that have been costly, things like air freight and expediting and items of that nature. And those items, ultimately will be released, I think to some extent by the capacity coming online in the future. But in the meantime, they're kind of built into the run rate, you can see the margins are even with those inefficiencies are pretty good. And we have really pushed our supply chain hard to serve our customers thus far, and it's been successful as you can see.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-27 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2020 second quarter conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, President and CEO and Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release which issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our 2020 third quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.  And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements on the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
James Loree: Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. What an eventful year it has been thus far. Going into 2020, we expected some volatility and uncertainty. However, no one could have anticipated the ups and downs and the twists and turns this year would take, and there's still two months ago.  As you saw from this morning's press release, our team is doing an impressive job managing through the trials and tribulations of this era. And I want to thank every one of our 54,000 plus associates who contributed to those results.  I'm happy to say that we nailed what was perhaps one of the best quarters in our history. Pick your metric – gross margin, operating margin, free cash flow, the list goes on.  For me, the most gratifying is the operating margin rate of 17.7%. We've proven over the decades since the Black & Decker merger that we can produce organic growth at a reasonably consistent 4% to 6%. However, our goal has always been to marry that up with relatively consistent operating margin rate accretion, with a goal of breaking through that 15% ceiling at some point. That has been elusive until now.  In late 2017, we entered what turned out to be a three-year period of significant external headwinds caused by tariffs, cost inflation and FX pressures, all totaling approximately $1 billion of unfavorable margin impact.  With a lot of work and a strong constitution, we were able to offset those headwinds and generate a 6% EPS CAGR during that era. We also bought Irwin, Lenox and Craftsman, among others, and utilized those acquisitions to cement incredibly strong strategic partnerships with our two major home center partners in the US, as well as building a thriving e-commerce business, including a partnership with North America's largest e-commerce player.  And when the pandemic hit by April, we phased into four weeks of revenues down 40% as the world went into lockdown and most retail channel partners dramatically cut their ordering. In response, we beefed up our already strong liquidity position and took out $1 billion of cost, including $0.5 billion of indirect or non-people related costs. We managed to keep our supply chain running with only minor disruption, including operating over 100 plants around the globe, and have done so successfully throughout the pandemic.  Then a strange thing happened in North America. People stuck in their homes, began to do projects, some DIY, some through trades people and contractors, and POS at our retail partners began to skyrocket in May. It has been at unprecedented levels ever since. By May, retailer inventories were plummeting. And recognizing that our supply chain lead times would preclude us from serving the demand if it sustained, we took a decision to invest $600 million in fast moving inventory in advance of orders from retailers beginning in the May timeframe.  That turned out to be an excellent call. In the third quarter, construction and DIY tool revenues in Europe and the emerging markets began to recover, while North American retail stayed strong. This caused positive revisions to our revenue estimates and ultimately drove double-digit growth in tools in the third quarter, even while some of our revenue shifted into October in the final days of September.  So, with that as backdrop, why am I so excited about our record 17.7% operating margin rate? The reason is that we believe we've achieved a new range of profitability to couple with our continued organic growth. Yes, continued organic growth. We believe if 2021 is a reasonably stable economic year that the 40% of our portfolio than in 2020 will be significantly down organically – that is industrial and the security segments – as well as industrial tools will bounce back and become a positive. We also believe that tools and outdoor will be very strong in 2021, with channel inventory rebuilds and continued pandemic end demand at least into the first half.  Our e-commerce position, which will approach $2 billion in 2020, should also continue to be a robust growth driver as we capitalize on our strength and make continued investments to make it even stronger.  We also believe that approximately $625 million of our $1 billion cost takeout will stick, resulting in some carryover benefits next year and that the margin resiliency initiative will continue to bear fruit in 2021, yielding $100 million to $150 million of additional margin tailwind. Perhaps most refreshing of all is the absence of sizable new headwinds in the area of FX, inflation and tariffs.  For all those reasons, as we sit here today, amidst all the market uncertainty, we believe the growth and margin story is sustainable in the stop/start kind of pandemic economy that we're in. My comments do not contemplate a severely pressured 2021 global economy and we do not believe that scenario to be the likely case.  Our people have worked tirelessly to produce these results. Our third quarter financial performance reflects the agility, courage and common sense of our leaders and their teams under the circumstances. And we thank them for that.  Now for a few financial highlights. Total company third quarter revenues were $3.9 billion, up 6% versus prior year. This included 4% organic growth and a 2-point contribution from the CAM acquisition. And turning to profitability, we executed to deliver a gross margin rate of 35.9% or 160 basis points above that of prior year. And as mentioned, our operating margin rate was a record 17.7%, up 320 basis points. This achievement was the result of strong cost control, our margin resiliency initiative, volume leverage and price. And leading this performance was Tools & Storage, delivering 11% organic growth and a record 21.5% operating margin rate.  Industrial achieved sequential improvement in both revenue and margins despite a steep year-over-year market-driven organic decline and effective cost management to protect margins helped position the business for outstanding volume leverage during an eventual market recovery.  And lastly, Security delivered stable results even in this climate with just a modest decline in organic growth and relatively flat operating margin. We continue to transform this business and are investing to capture the emerging health and safety opportunity related to the pandemic. We're excited to realize the benefits from this multi-year transformation with a potential for organic growth with margin expansion in 2021 and beyond.  And finally, all of this was punctuated by record adjusted EPS of $2.89, which was up 36% versus last year, as well as $615 million of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $391 million, up over $400 million year-over-year.  And as we look ahead, our well-established pandemic priorities remain consistent. First, ensuring the health and safety of our employees and our supply chain partners. Second, maintaining business continuity and financial strength and stability. Third, serving our customers as they provide essential products and services to the world. And fourth, doing our part to mitigate the impact of the virus across the globe.  The pandemic is not over yet. We are maintaining our focus and not letting our guard down as we enter the next phase and continue to manage with agility and resiliency. These priorities have helped us keep our employees as safe and secure as possible, operate continuously to serve our customers and to support our communities during this challenging period.  We will continue to exercise discipline on expenses and reap the benefits of the cost savings program put in place earlier this year. We are concurrently making investments in key growth areas associated with reconnecting with home and outdoors, e-commerce and health and safety even as we work to ensure that our operating margins stay in the 15% plus zip code.  In summary, it was a truly notable quarter and there's a lot to be excited about for the future, including MTD, which brings between $2 billion and $3 billion dollars of revenue and becomes executable beginning in July 2021.  Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to Don Allan to provide you more color on the third quarter as well as our scenario planning as we look to the fourth quarter and beyond. 
Donald Allan, Jr. : Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the third quarter.  Tools & Storage delivered excellent revenue growth, volume up 10% and price contributing 1 point. The segment organic growth for the third quarter was impacted by the timing of promotional volume that ended up shipping in October versus our previous expectation of September. This represented approximately $100 million to $125 million for 4 to 5-point impact versus the 3Q revenue planning assumption we communicated in late August.  As many of you know, there is a significant amount of volume that goes into the channel for the fourth quarter holiday promotions during the September through October timeframe. You will see this timing shift included in the Q4 planning assumptions that I will review later.  The third quarter operating margin rate was outstanding and clearly a record performance at 21.5% for Tools & Storage, up 490 basis points versus the prior year as volume, productivity, cost control and price delivered the strong margin rate expansion.  As volume growth accelerated, we experienced excellent operating leverage due to the significant adjustments to our cost base over the last six months in response to the pandemic.  Now, let's take a look at some of the geographies within Tools & Storage. North America was up 11% organically. US retail delivered 16% organic growth, driven by strong DIY and improving professional demand, along with continued momentum within the e-commerce platforms.  POS remained very robust throughout the quarter as we experienced an average growth in the low 20s percentile over the entire third quarter. The US retail store inventory levels, although up slightly from the beginning of the quarter, remained significantly lower than last year.  The North American commercial and industrial tool channels continued to see a slower path of recovery compared to the strong results in US retail as the commercial channel declined 7% during the quarter. Within this channel, there are a mix of customers that serve both construction and industrial markets. If you look at pure play construction focused customers in this channel, greenshoots emerged and they delivered low single-digit organic growth for the quarter, a positive signal that the pro is returning.  Finally, in North America, our industrial and automotive tools business declined 11%, which was a significant improvement from the 2Q decline of 25%.  Moving to Europe, Europe delivered 12% organic growth, benefiting from similar trends as North America, as well as channel inventory recoveries as these markets emerge from the Q2 shutdown. We believe the channel inventory increases represented approximately a third of the growth within this region.  The result was led by construction markets and was experienced across all major geographies, with the UK, Central Europe and Iberia up double digits, and France, Germany, Italy and the Nordics up mid to high single digits.  Organic growth in emerging markets was up 11%, led by pricing, improved demand and an inventory recovery. Latin America led the way and was up 12% in the quarter. The growth was broad based with Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia up double digits, with Mexico and Peru up mid-single digits.  Asia was down low single digits in the quarter, with modest growth in South Korea, India, Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam, which was offset by declines in China and Southeast Asia.  And then finally, Russia and Turkey had very strong growth during Q3, contributing to the recovery for overall emerging markets.  Now, let's shift to the FPUs within Tools & Storage. Power tools and equipment delivered 22% organic growth, benefiting from strong commercial execution and new product introductions.  Despite the difficult comps earlier in the year, Craftsman is benefiting from the strong DIY and e-commerce momentum, resulting in growth significantly ahead of our expectations and starting to approach our annual goal of $1 billion in revenue.  Additionally, DeWalt is capturing the positive trajectory in the pro recovery, as well as new product introductions such as Power Detect and continued expansion of our Flexvolt, Atomic, and Xtreme breakthrough innovations into new product in Tools & Storage, which declined 5% for Q3.  New product introductions and DIY growth were not enough to counter a large exposure to industrial focused customers, which are still declining but sequentially improving as I mentioned previously.  Now, e-commerce continues to see strong momentum and we saw that experience throughout the quarter. Driven by impressive exponential growth across all regions, this channel represented approximately 18% of the global Tools & Storage revenue for the third quarter. As we continue to expand our market leading share position in this strategic channel, we are making targeted investments to bring in world class talent and expand our digital capabilities to maximize this rapidly accelerating opportunity.  So, in summary, despite a very dynamic environment, it was an outstanding quarter for Tools & Storage. The business delivered a record operating margin rate, executing on the cost actions while demonstrating the agility to meet the strengthening demand that emerged throughout the quarter. Great work by our Tools & Storage teams.  Turning to the Industrial segment, total growth was negative 7%, which included a 10-point benefit from the CAM acquisition and currency contributed a positive 1%. This was offset by an 18% decline in volume. Despite the significant organic declines, we are cautiously optimistic in the positive sequential improvement in the markets across many [Technical Difficulty] businesses, with automotive showing the largest Q3 sequential improvement.  Operating margin rate was down year-over-year to a respectable 12.3% as the impact from market-driven volume decline was partially offset by swift cost control.  Our cost actions are having a significant impact and contributed to a 350-basis point sequential improvement in the margins.  Let's now dive a bit deeper into this segment. Engineered fastening organic revenues were down 14%, driven by lower global light vehicle and industrial production. The declines were experienced across all regions. Although global light vehicle production remained down 5% year-over-year, forecasts continue to improve. As a result, automotive fasteners experienced strong sequential improvement from April, relatively in line with this mid-single digit decline in light vehicle production.  However, our auto systems business is still experiencing significant declines in the low 20s as OEMs continue to conserve capital in response to the current market environment. Industrial fasteners declined high teens. And despite more positive indications for global industrial production, recovery in these markets have not bounced back as quickly. Our customer insights indicate that the majority of the manufacturers are balancing the initial surge and pent up demand following the Q2 closures with a slower trajectory towards normalized business activity.  Infrastructure declined 25% due to lower volumes in attachment tools, which was down in the high teens, while oil and gas declined 35% due to a sharp reduction in pipeline project activity. While the outlook for oil and gas remains challenged, we are beginning to see positive signs and improving environment in attachment tools.  And finally, let's turn to Security. Total revenue was relatively flat versus prior year, with volume down 4%, partially offset by benefits from both price and currency. North America declined 3%, primarily due to lower installations in commercial electronic security and health care due to the pandemic.  Europe experienced a modest organic decline as growth within the Nordics and France was offset by lower volume in the UK. However, global backlog remains in a healthy position and is up versus the prior year, while order rates in electronic security have continued to gain strong momentum since Q2.  One item to briefly note before I cover margins related to Security, during Q3, we reached an agreement with Securitas to sell commercial electronic operations in five countries in Europe and emerging markets. These businesses represented approximately $85 million in annual revenue and the divestiture will be modestly accretive to segment margins going forward. This decision represented normal portfolio pruning and will allow our Security team to focus their efforts and resources on our geographies where we have strong market positions.  Now in terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate was up 10 basis points to 11% as pricing, cost control more than offset the impact from lower volume and growth investments. We delivered this margin expansion and funded growth investments with a 90-basis point expansion in our gross margins, another very positive sign of the business transformation underway.  As the market normalizes and we ramp up the new growth opportunities within health and safety, the security business is well positioned to return to organic growth and consistent margin expansion as we head into 2021.  So, in summary of all our businesses, a very strong quarter as we continue to navigate the uncertainty in the current environment. As I take a step back and reflect, I am so proud of how our team stepped up during the crisis to position the business for success.  Our Industrial business, hit with the steepest market declines, is on track to deliver double-digit margins this year, far improved from the 7% margin prior recession trough the Industrial segment experienced by Black & Decker during 2009.  Security has taken swift action to return to margin expansion and is now focused on accelerating its transformation with several exciting growth initiatives.  And of course, what a performance by Tools to reposition its margin potential during this downturn, while simultaneously investing in programs that can keep us on the offensive as it relates to growth and share gain.  Let's now briefly look at how this translated into free cash flow performance on the next stage. On a year-to-date basis, our cash generation is $391 million, which is $412 million ahead of the prior year. The strong performance was driven by approximately $600 million of free cash flow generated in the third quarter.  Our cost focus combined with a surging demand in Tools & Storage resulted in strong earnings growth, lower working capital versus the prior year and reduced capital expenditures.  As we look ahead into closing this year, our priority is to ensure we maintain appropriate levels of working capital to support the continued strong growth for Tools & Storage into 2021, as well as market recoveries in our other businesses.  As a result of this key priority, our plan assumes $300 million of incremental working capital in Q4, which will reduce our normal seasonal working capital benefit versus prior years.  Even considering this planning assumption, we expect to generate a significant amount of cash in the fourth quarter and our planning assumption is for $800 million to $900 million of free cash flow for the full year of 2020.  From a capital deployment perspective, while we have removed our explicit pause on M&A and share repurchase, our priority today is deleveraging in line with our strong investment credit ratings.  In terms of our liquidity and balance sheet, we ended the quarter with full access to our $3 billion commercial paper facility and approximately $700 million of cash on hand. As a reminder, we do not have any long-term debt maturities until late next year. So, as you can see, we have maintained flexibility from a liquidity standpoint.  I would now like to discuss the third quarter exit trends for demand and how we are planning for the fourth quarter. On slide 8, I will start on the left side of the page and walk through a segment view of our fourth quarter planning assumption range. I will also provide color on the geographic or key business exit trends. In this case, I will use September and October month to date actual shipments as our exit trend, which normalizes for various timing factors.  For Tools & Storage, we are planning for a fourth quarter range of 8% to 10% organic growth. One key assumption in the Tools & Storage range continues to be the sustainability of the strong demand within US retail.  I'm happy to report that POS in North American retail has remained strong. While demand is lower than some of this stratospheric levels we experienced in Q2, the POS growth has remained very strong in the low 20s for the prior four and eight-week period.  POS for the most recent four-week period for brands such as Craftsman and Stanley are delivering similar levels of growth that was demonstrated over the entirety of the third quarter.  POS growth within our more pro focused brands such as DeWalt and Stanley FatMax have accelerated in recent periods, reflecting the positive trajectory of the pro recovery which gained momentum as the third quarter progressed. Our planning range assumes that POS will be maintained in the mid-teens to the low 20s for the entire fourth quarter.  The recoveries in Europe and Latin America accelerated in the third quarter and we continue to see positive momentum. However, we are planning for a moderate deceleration of shipment growth from Q3, factoring in the inventory recovery that occurred for these regions. Finally, the US commercial and industrial channels, along with Asia, should continue to see sequential improvement, but are planned at slower trajectories compared to the other channels or regions within the segment.  The revenue trends in the Tools business for the last eight weeks support our view of continued strong performance as we've experienced growth at 12% in this time horizon. This is slightly above the high end of our planning range for Q4. However, we anticipate the deceleration in the international markets primarily to occur over the remainder of the quarter.  For Industrial, our plan assumes for an organic decline of 10% to 15%. Many of the end markets are demonstrating continued recoveries. Exceptions are aerospace and oil and gas which are longer cycle and we are planning for protracted recovery.  On the positive side, we have continued to see improvement in automotive production forecasts, industrial production trends, and order momentum in attachment tools. Our midpoint would assume continued improvement within automotive attachment tools and general industrial end markets versus Q3.  The revenue trends for the last eight weeks support continued recovery for this segment, as our shipments were down 11% organically, in line with the more optimistic end of our Q4 planning range.  Another positive signal is that engineered fastening has demonstrated organic growth over the last four weeks. Market momentum and easier comps in this segment are starting to emerge.  Turning to Security, our plan assumes for a range of down low single digits to a high end of being relatively flat organically. Exit trends for this business are tracking relatively in line with this range, which is a good result considering that Security grew 4% organically in Q4 2019.  Although the recovery continues to be mixed by country, backlog remains strong and odors have been gaining momentum which supports an opportunity for sequential improvement with installation and maintenance activity.  Additionally, the business is focused on stimulating demand with their existing and new health and safety solutions, which have emerged from the pandemic and will begin to generate revenue prior to the end of the year.  As you aggregate this for the total company, we are planning for a Q4 range of 3% to 5% organic growth. The low end of this range represents a moderation in the strong POS within US retail or a meaningful deceleration in the recovery trajectories in industrial, security or the remaining tool market.  The high end of our range reflects continued positive momentum in the recovery and with North American POS levels continuing to be strong. We currently are not planning for an improvement in store inventory levels within this range for our Tools & Storage major customers.  The company revenue trend is up 7% organically across September and October month to date. Considering we would expect it to be a little stronger initially due to the monthly timing and tools previously mentioned in our revenue range, it is a reasonable expectation at this stage for the fourth quarter.  Now moving to page 9, I would like to provide an update on our cost program. As a quick reminder, we targeted four areas of opportunity – indirect spend, compensation, benefits and raw material deflation.  We are on track to capture the previously outlined $500 million 2020 benefit. During the third quarter, we realized $175 million as a benefit which brings our year-to-date savings to $350 million.  The organization continues to make progress on improving the sustainability of our cost action. As you think about the program heading into 2021, we are still on track to deliver a positive carryover of $125 million, net of cost associated with restoring the temporary cost actions implemented earlier this year.  In addition to this positive carryover, we continue to execute on our margin resiliency initiatives and expect to see an opportunity for $300 million to $500 million over the next three-year period. A reasonable expectation for the 2021 margin resiliency opportunity is a range of $100 million to $150 million.  As a reminder, we view this program as an incremental source of contingency to offset any unforeseen headwinds that may arise throughout the year, support investment into the business or support margin expansion and outperformance.  Now, I'll quickly summarize our 2020 planning assumptions on slide 10. From a revenue perspective, as I mentioned, we see a potential for a range of 3% to 5% organic growth in the fourth quarter. From a cost structure perspective, we had $180 million of 2020 savings from our Q4 2019 cost reduction program and expect an additional $500 million from the cost actions announced earlier this year as I just mentioned. Tariffs and FX are currently expected to be $165 million headwind, with $140 million of that behind us through three quarters.  Considering these factors, we are planning for a full year operating margin dollar growth in the mid-single digits and significant margin rate expansion versus the prior year.  Finally, we have disclosed our assumptions for the below-the-line items as you work to model various business scenarios.  When you evaluate all these financial factors and complete the math, the result will be an EPS range centered around our 2019 EPS result of $8.40 per share, an excellent potential outcome given where the world was six months ago in the depths of the crisis.  From a cash deployment perspective, our near-term focus is deleveraging. We are maintaining our capital expenditure reductions, while continuing to invest in the key areas that drive growth, margin resiliency, or support footprint moves in Tools & Storage.  We will keep a sharp focus on working capital management and have aligned our supply chain to serve the strong revenue growth.  I know many of you are thinking about 2021 at this point. As outlined earlier, we have built approximately $125 million of positive carryover from our cost program and have margin resiliency at our disposal to serve as a contingency.  In addition, as Jim mentioned, we don't see major headwinds or tailwinds from an input cost perspective at this stage. Therefore, this sets up nicely to handle a significant amount of cost headwinds should they emerge or outperform expectations if these headwinds do not emerge.  As it relates to revenue, our visibility has improved, but it's far too early to comment on market demand for 2021. That being said, we don't accept the notion that our setup is a story about insurmountable comps. Consider that, in 2020, approximately 25% of the portfolio is expected to show double-digit market-driven organic retractions mainly concentrated industrial-focused end markets across our segments.  It is reasonable to expect growth from an arguably easy set of comps in this category. 20% of the portfolio is showing modest retractions this year in addition to the 25% I just mentioned. This would include Security and some of our emerging market geographies in Tools. These businesses certainly don't have tough setups as we sit here today and appear poised to be able to demonstrate growth.  The remaining 55% of the company, which includes North American retail and European Tools & Storage, will show growth this year, but the setup for the front half of 2021 is very good as they retracted organically in the comparable period in 2020 due to the shutdown and inventory corrections that we experienced. These markets have continued to stay strong and the refocus on the home trend has emerged and continues.  Finally, we have a host of growth catalysts that Jim will outline in a moment. We believe we have the investments and the initiatives in place to drive the next leg of share gain across our businesses.  But considering all these factors, and of course, assuming no adverse changes in market demand due to major economic pullbacks, we do not see any reason at this point as to why we cannot demonstrate organic growth in each of our segments in 2021.  So, hopefully, this helps you see why we are excited with the potential for the company to create significant shareholder value in 2021 and beyond.  Thank you. And I will now turn it back to Jim. 
James Loree : Okay. Thank you, Don. Like I said before, no one could have anticipated the ups and downs and the twists and turns this year would take and it looks like it's going to be a great outcome.  Look, we've covered a lot of ground already. And so, I'll just take a few more minutes to highlight our growth catalysts. The Craftsman brand rollout remains a key element of our growth strategy and the surge in DIY outdoor and positive trends in e-commerce have further accelerated this opportunity. By the end of the year, we expect to deliver $900 million of cumulative growth from this program since acquisition and about $100 million dollars ahead of our latest plan.  And with more Craftsman growth opportunities on the horizon, we can reiterate our commitment to achieve the $1 billion revenue targets six years earlier than we committed during our initial acquisition announcement. We can now start to evaluate how much further we can go beyond $1 billion over the course of time, especially with the potential addition of outdoor power equipment through MTD. The MTD opportunity gives us an option beginning in the middle of the next year to acquire the remaining 80% of one of the great American outdoor power equipment companies at an all-in multiple that will be in the 7 to 8 times EBITDA range. We continue to be encouraged by their product development pipeline as well as their progress on improving profitability.  That category is experiencing similar benefits from the consumers' reconnection with the home. And we continue to be excited about the runway for growth by leveraging brand, technology and channel synergies. This combination has the potential to generate significant shareholder value by expanding our presence in this $20 billion plus market.  And everybody understands how the pandemic has accelerated the consumer shift to e-commerce. In Tools, we are the industry leader in this channel by a factor of approximately 3x and we've been working on it for 10 years, building e-commerce partnerships with major players all around the world.  Over that timeframe, it has evolved from nothing to representing at least 18% of sales, up 5 points this year alone. We're investing in new talent, digital capabilities and our brands, including the revitalization of the Black & Decker brand to capture this compelling opportunity.  And we have the products. Despite all the cost actions, we are continuing to invest in our product innovation machine, bringing new core and breakthrough innovations to the market. In Tools, we continue to strengthen our position as the industry leader in maximizing power output, with innovations like DeWalt Power Detect and FlexVolt Advantage. The extension of our innovative Atomic and Xtreme power tool platforms into new products and categories is providing more solutions for users to expand their toolkits with the highest power to weight ratios available in the market.  And the societal obsession with health and safety that we're all experiencing right now has created new opportunities for Security. Our transformation came at the right time as Security is leveraging capabilities that have been developed during the last two years, such as digitally proficient talent, technology, and partnerships to commercialize new solutions.  These are products such as automated entrance management with facility threshold controls, contact and proximity tracing, and touchless doors for commercial establishments that will begin to show revenue in 2021. And taken together, these growth catalysts have the potential to generate over $3 billion to $4 billion of revenue annually over a multi-year period. The shareholder value creation potential is compelling over the medium to long term.  And as for the short term, it was a remarkable quarter and one for the record books. Despite the pandemic, we are running on all cylinders. The fourth quarter looks to be strong, as Don pointed out as well.  I want to thank you all for your interest and support, as well as thank our Stanley Black & Decker leaders and their associates for their commitment and effort as we look ahead to our next chapter, which we expect to be a powerful growth story with significant margin accretion potential.  Dennis, we are now ready for Q&A. 
Dennis Lange : Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. 
Jeff Sprague: A bunch of questions. I guess I'll trust those behind me will ask the ones I don't. I want to focus in on margins a little bit more, if we could. And just understand if there was anything really unusual in the Tools margin in the quarter. And then just thinking about what you're suggesting for organic growth, it looks like it would put Tools revenues in Q4 similar, maybe up slightly from Q3. So, maybe you could just give us a little additional color on margins specifically in Tools & Storage from Q3 into Q4. Thank you. 
Donald Allan, Jr.: The third quarter margins, as we mentioned, were really outstanding at 21.5%. And there was nothing unusual in there or one time in nature. It was really a demonstration of the significant amount of costs that we took out very quickly back starting in March and April timeframe of this year. A lot of that was temporary. Then we did a very quick pivot – do you remember back in June and July? – to convert a large portion of that to permanent cost actions and make it sustainable going forward because we recognize the volatility of the situation and we're really starting to see the benefit of those cost actions flowing through the margins and maintaining our cost base at this level as we see the strong top line growth and get outstanding operating leverage as a result.  Let me just be clear that, for those of you wondering if we're just cranking up the plants, and that's resulting in some unusual benefits to margins, that's not the case. The way that accounting works, it actually gets hung up on your balance sheet for almost six months and you don't really see that benefit till later on down the road. So, we're not seeing that benefit because I know that's probably a question some of you have. It's really just what I mentioned. It's really focused on the cost actions we took and the benefit of operating leverage associated with that.  On the organic growth part of your question, yeah, I would say we're probably looking at a similar Q4 to what we just experienced in Q3 for Tools, and, frankly, for the company as well, overall. And we'll see how that plays out. We've had a great start to the fourth quarter. We really feel positive about the performance in the month of October. But we also know that, in the fourth quarter, the heavy revenue month, really the biggest one is October and then the beginning of November is pretty strong too. So, it's great to have that start at the beginning of the quarter. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. 
Deepa Raghavan: I'll stick with the margin theme here too. Don, you noted Tools & Storage margins have stepped up higher. Can you talk about how much of that structural lift in margin sticks over the medium term? That is, how much higher than the 17% T&S margins we should be expecting on a go-forward basis here?  Also, a quick clarification on 2021 margin resiliency measures of $100 million to $150 million. Will that be pulled only if things deteriorate versus your plan? Or will that be layered in irrespective? Thank you. 
Donald Allan, Jr.: On your first question, we really are very focused right now on how do we take this step change in margin rates for Tools and do our best to make a large part of it sustainable. And I really think when you see the Q4 result, and actually when you do the math and you start to think through the models, you're going to see that the margin rate in Q4 is going to be – although not as high as Q3 because we do have a normal tick down due to some holiday mix factors that occur in the fourth quarter, but still will be around 20%. It will be a very strong margin rate for the fourth quarter for Tools & Storage.  When I think about going forward into next year, we are now looking at this business as being a very high teens margin business, and we want to be able to maintain that going forward. And so, that's our view at the stage. They will exit the year around 18% for the full year for margins. And we would expect them to continue to be somewhere between 18% and 20% next year, barring any unusual things that – headwinds or things like that, that we're not expecting at this stage.  As far as margin resiliency, we're going after that number no matter what. So, these are these are things associated with Industry 4.0, commercial pricing excellence, some of the plant moves we're doing around the world to streamline our operations, et cetera, and so we will aggressively go after that $300 million to $500 million over the next three years, the $100 million to $150 million for 2021. And so, it sets up a nice contingency if we need it. And as I said in my script, if we don't need it, they'll help us either make some investments or have an outperformance or a mix of both. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. 
Josh Pokrzywinski: I'll just shift over to growth. And, Don, one comment you made about the lack of contemplated inventory replenishment. I know we're kind of talking about percentages of percentages, given that it's really just a phenomenon that precedent in US retail. But I think some of Jim's earlier comments dating back to other points in the third quarter suggest there's maybe four or five weeks of inventory that could use replenished at some point. My math would say that, on the totality of Tools & Storage, that's still kind of a mid to high-single digit percentage of any given quarters of growth potential. Is that something that we see stretching out here into the first half of 2021? And is that kind of the right order of magnitude to think about what that restock means in terms of segment organic growth?
James Loree: It's Jim. I know you directed it towards Don, but I feel lonely because everybody wants to talk about margins, and I'm not an expert – I know how to make them expand, but I'm not an expert on the details of the margins. So, I'll take that one.  And we've had a lot of customer contact with our partners who have these inventories that are not where they want them to be. And the fill rates are not exactly where they want them to be, although I think we're doing reasonably well in relation to their typical suppliers. So, there is this replenishment of – and I think you're in the right zone, about four weeks or so of inventory that we would all – customers and us would all like to replenish. But keeping up with the POS, I feel humbled to say that right now is really a challenge. So, yes, I think you've got it right, in the sense that it's not going to be solved in the fourth quarter and the customers are very, very clear about, it must be solved in the in the first quarter. And we hope to be able to do that and to fulfill their needs. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. 
Julian Mitchell: Apologies, Jim. Maybe one more question on margins. Looking at it – maybe two parts, I suppose. In 2021, understand that the margin resiliency and the carryover sort of net of temporary actions, but should we expect much in the way of things like outright new selling costs coming back or R&D perhaps stepping up or are those sort of all included when you talk about a reinstatement of actions? And also, beyond 2021, broad thoughts on incremental margins in Tools? What do you think your entitlement is there when you consider competition the channel, but also your margin resiliency efforts? 
Donald Allan, Jr.: I would say that, you look at the back half of this year for Tools & Storage margins, we're clearly benefiting from some amazing operating leverage that most likely we will not get that magnitude of operating leverage next year because we will do some of the things you mentioned, we will continue to invest in growth, and so we may not have 21.5% or 20% margins like we're going to have in the back half of this year. But we believe we're going to have margins that, as I said, are somewhere between 18% and 20%. So, pretty robust margins as we make some of those investments, which means our operating leverage will still be very, very strong, probably somewhere between 30% and 40%, leaning more towards the 40% next year and pretty robust.  And so, I think we've positioned our cost base, we're positioning our manufacturing footprint as we continue to make changes to that as well as expand some capacity in certain areas around distribution and manufacturing to allow us to make sure that we continue to have that type of leverage as we're able to benefit from this significant growth environment, which has the potential to continue for much longer than the first three to six months of next year. We'll see how that plays out. And whether there's certain factors like US stimulus and other things that continue to drive that type of performance. But there's a lot of activity, as you know, a focus around the home that Jim touched on and e-commerce as well. And so, we're really trying to prepare ourselves for that type of environment that may continue for maybe 12 to 18 months. And as a result, I expect to see very strong margins throughout next year in the range that I mentioned. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan.
Michael Rehaut: I just wanted to get a finer understanding on the promotional sales shift, number one, in Tools & Storage. Looked like it was expecting another 4 to 5 points of growth in the third quarter, but now that shifts into the fourth quarter. However, I'd be surprised if you were to say – excluding that – if that normal shift had occurred or the sales were in September, I'd be hard pressed to say you would be looking for a mid-single digit organic growth range. So, just want to try to understand how that kind of works through and also if it has different – if those sales have different margins being promotional sales.  And lastly, I'd just love to get some additional comments in terms of the growth opportunity you see for the company over the next couple of years in e-commerce? 
James Loree: I'll take the latter part of your question and Don will take the former part. 
Donald Allan, Jr.: If we go back to the Tools shift from Q3 to Q4, about 4 to 5 points, as I mentioned and you mentioned as well. So, yeah, when you think about the dynamics of what's happening in the fourth quarter, we're getting a really strong surge here in October of some things that shifted from the month of September to October.  And when you look at the performance for the full quarter, it's going to be a similar type result as what we experienced in Q3. So, if that 4 or 5 points that shifted into Q3, we'd be kind of looking at mid to high-single digits performance in Tools & Storage for the full quarter.  But that factors in a lot of different things. You have to recognize that, although POS in North America is strong and we're assuming it's somewhere between mid-teens to low 20 percentile, other things – the growth is decelerating in certain parts, like the European markets, the emerging markets. We saw some inventory kind of stocking and restocking in those geographies that will not repeat itself here in the fourth quarter. So, although we see growth, it won't be of the same magnitude we saw there.  And then, we still have some portions of the business that are retracting, although retracting at slightly lower percentages than what we saw in Q3. We still have that as a factor as well.  So, when you pull that all together, that's kind of how you get to that net result at the end of the day. Jim?
James Loree: On e-commerce, obviously, we're very excited about this topic because when it was not very popular, we were kind of a couple of yards and a cloud of dust, just workman like going after it, building it, zero – almost zero in 2010. And today, we're knocking on the door of $2 billion in e-commerce and the profitability is good. It's not something that you can worry about negative mix. The profitability is good. The cost to serve is actually reasonable vis-à-vis other channels and gross margins are excellent.  So, today, we have a vast network of partnerships around the world with major e-commerce players. And we're very pleased with that and proud of that, ranging from Alibaba to Amazon to some of the regional players and so forth. It's all B2B2C as opposed to D2C, which is okay for us. It's worked well.  And, frankly, our competition has more or less shied away, have not really made it a strategic focus in general. So, we sit here today in a very good place with strength. And so, we're not naive to think that the competition is not going to jump in. Of course, they are. But we are going to double down in this area and have already constructed a $75 million worth of investments over the next year or two to strengthen our position in e-commerce. And one of the big initiatives is the Black & Decker brand revitalization. It's probably a little-known fact. But the Black & Decker brand plays extremely well with the younger generations. And of course, younger generations are the core of the e-commerce of growth in the future.  So, with Jeff Ansell running this Black & Decker revitalization initiative in partnership with a major e-commerce player in North America is kind of one of our elements of the strategy. And then, we also have significant investments in the core, so strengthening the core e-commerce that we have as well with additional resources, additional focus on content creation and market development. And also, initiatives, pretty significant initiatives in Germany, China and India, all D2C.  So, areas where our share is not where we're under indexed, if you will, from an existing channel perspective. Going D2C in those markets because we have very little to lose, especially in China and India, and really excited about this. I think e-commerce is going to be a major, major growth driver for many years to come. 
Operator: And our last question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joe Ritchie: Wanted to maybe stick on growth for my one question. When you guys issued your 8-K intra quarter in 3Q, I think you guys were calling for high teens T&S growth and recognized the promotional activity was 4 to 5 points. And so, I was wondering if you could maybe just elaborate what else changed relative to your expectations earlier in the quarter? And then, specifically, I've heard you call out international decelerating and inventory levels. Just any more color around on around that specifically would be helpful. Thank you. 
Donald Allan, Jr.: I would say that, when we did the announcement back in late August, we said in Q3, for Tools, we see kind of a high teens performance for organic and we talked about the reasons why it's different. We also communicated that we expected Q4 to have kind of low single-digit growth. So, we're indicating that the back half would probably grow somewhere around 7%, 8%, in that range. We're now looking at a back half that's going to grow around 10%. And potentially a little bit better if some of the trends continue here in Q4 that we saw in October. So, we're seeing a better growth profile for the back half of the year in total versus what we thought about a month and a half ago or so for the Tools & Storage business. And a large part of that is the continued strength of North American retail and what we're seeing there with POS. And although we do have some de-selling in Europe and the growth number will be lower, but still very good versus Q3 because Q3 was pretty robust and kind of mid-teens number for growth, we'll probably see something that's closer to half of that in our European markets. And that factors in some of the inventory stocking that we saw in Q3.  So, the things that have really shifted are that we were able to recognize how much inventory was built in our customers throughout the third quarter. And there was a significant amount in some of the international markets and very little in the North American retail channel.  And then, here in the fourth quarter, we see the dynamic of not having – as I said, we're not really putting any inventory build in the fourth quarter. At the end of the day, could there be a little bit in the North American retail channel when we're done? Maybe, but it's probably going to be pretty modest to the point that Jim made when he answered this question earlier. The bigger part of the adjustment is going to happen in Q1. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. 
Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2020 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker’s 2020 second quarter conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, President and CEO… …this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning’s call will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our 2020 second quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller, and as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements on the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It’s therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
Jim Loree: Okay. Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. It’s great to be here with you today and now we are about five months in since COVID-19 began to roll across the globe. And while this pandemic has created an incredibly challenging time for all of us, it has also cast a new and very positive light on our portfolio as three powerful trends have emerged, which worked to our significant benefit. First, there’s the sudden acceleration in the shift to e-commerce, and then there is a reconnection with the home and garden and a trend towards nesting and DIY, and thirdly, a newfound societal obsession with health and safety, read security. The combination of these trends has profound and exciting implications for our future growth and strategic positioning, but more on that in just a few moments. In the meantime, we just completed what I would characterize as one of the most storied and most successful quarters we have experienced in my 21 years as a C level executive at this company. It was successful based on the sheer magnitude of the challenges we faced and overcame, and it was also successful in that we have managed to operate effectively and maintain the strength of our enterprise throughout the crisis to-date, while further strengthening the company and positioning it for even better margin performance and growth as we take stock here in the middle innings and we look forward. Let me give you a sense of some of the accomplishments our team has racked up since this crisis began. We were able to operate continuously across the globe with only minor and temporary supply disruptions, while protecting our employees and maintaining the highest health and safety standards. We managed to handle with remarkable efficiency. The most volatile intra-quarter demand swings we have ever experienced, beginning in the first four weeks of April. During which revenues were down approximately 40%, followed by an explosive May and June, which brought our point-of-sale in North American retail to stratospheric levels that we have never seen before. Security revenues also improved dramatically as the quarter progressed. We took swift and decisive cost actions early in the crisis, announcing a $1 billion annual cost reduction initiative in April, of which $175 million was realized in the second quarter. Our margin resiliency initiative now in its second year contributed to this impressive performance. We substantially raised our second quarter revenue planning assumptions twice during the quarter, while maintaining our cost reductions intact. This bodes well for the remainder of the year and we were able to upgrade our internal full year revenue and margin scenario analyses accordingly. Now our current base case for full year 2020 revenue and operating margin exceeds what we thought our best case was for the year back in April. And as a consequence of the better 2Q volume, in conjunction with our cost and margin actions, we delivered $3.1 billion of revenue and $1.60 in EPS. Our operating margin rate came in at 12.8%, just 200 basis points lower than in second quarter 2019. And the Tools & Storage business logged an impressive 17% segment operating margin rate, flat with prior year, which means that that business achieved its previous peak margin performance in what we currently believe will be the trough quarter in the cycle for tools with revenues down 16%. As we enter July, given the uncertain economic outlook ahead, we decided to convert the run rate financial impact of our temporary salaried workforce reductions into permanent savings. We will implement this in early October by eliminating our temporary salaried actions that is furloughs and modified work weeks, returning 9,300 employees to a full work schedule, while transferring the remaining 1,000 or so to permanent reduction status. This action will be a major step in ensuring the sustainability of the bulk of our $1 billion cost reduction actions and we believe it paves the way for us to manage successfully through any reasonable economic scenario, which may unfold in the coming months. In the back half of the quarter, with the supply chain performing and the cost reductions intact, we decided to identify a series of supercharged growth initiatives, which we will pursue in addition to the ones already in place. These initiatives have become even more attractive as a result of trends catalyzed by COVID-19 and are being funded as we speak. We expect these initiatives, which include exercising our option to acquire the remaining 80% of MTD, most likely in early 2022 to contribute $3 billion to $4 billion of incremental annual revenue beginning in 2022. All of that execution occurred, while our salaried workforce was working remotely for the most part. We accomplished so much so fast during this time frame that we gained a new appreciation for the art of the possible when the power of people is combined with the power of today’s collaboration technologies. And finally, I would be remiss, as I think of our second quarter accomplishments if I didn’t reference the incredible resiliency and dedication of our people. It was the extraordinary people in our factories, distribution centers, service centers, call centers, as well as our field techs and the salaried people in their homes that took a leap of faith and trusted that we could operate continuously, safely and successfully during this time, when everyone is dealing with extraordinary personal and other challenges. And it is to them that we owe a debt of gratitude and thanks for a job well done under extremely difficult circumstances. Throughout the crisis, we have remained focused on our key COVID-19 era priorities, which we shared with you earlier this year, first, ensuring the health and safety of our employees and supply chain partners, second, maintaining business continuity and financial strength and stability, third, serving our customers who provide essential products and services, and fourth, doing our part to help mitigate the impact of the virus across the globe. Our number one priority has been and continues to be the health and safety of our people and supply chain partners. We continue to take significant measures to protect our 30,000-plus employees in our plants and distribution centers and other essential facilities. On a tactical level, we established a mandatory mask policy in all locations in April, along with temperature taking and health questionnaires for all people entering facilities. We have continuously enforced social distancing, modifying our facilities and production lines where necessary. We implemented intensive standardization protocols in all of our operations as well and we formed a corporate safety committee of senior execs and specialists to review and monitor compliance with our COVID-19 safety protocols and hired Chief Medical Officer specializing in infectious disease control as part of that committee. We review every suspected case for root cause, trace it to completion where possible and respond with appropriate actions as we continue to learn more about the virus and its transmission characteristics. And as you would expect, with geographic hotspots in California, Texas, the Carolinas, Mexico, Brazil and others, all areas where we have significant operations, we have seen our share of confirmed cases, which as of today, number approximately 300 or about one-half of 1% of our total workforce. Notably, both Europe and Asia have been very quiet and we have had only one confirmed case in China during the entire crisis, remarkable given that we have 10 plants and 8,000 people there. The vast majority of confirmed cases have resulted from contracting the virus, while colleagues were out in their local communities or were visiting with friends and our family or were in a hospital for an unrelated matter. And as a result, we have been conducting a massive educational campaign for our associates through two global safety timeouts and several other approaches. We seek to ensure their effect based understanding of risks and required safety protocols and to reinforce how our employees can stay safe at work and in the community. There’s a lot of information -- misinformation out in the public regarding this virus and the common understanding is necessary to keep people as healthy and safe as possible. And with so many of our associates homebound, our people are operating remotely in new and efficient ways, and we are seeing many unanticipated benefits of this future of work. It has allowed us to virtually flatten the organization, incorporating more diverse perspectives into decision-making, and enabling faster and more efficient collaboration. Going forward, remote and hybrid office remote work will facilitate flexible working arrangements for our salaried people, enabling the reduction of our office real estate footprint, opening up new access to talent across the globe. And as we move forward, we will continue to have offices as activity hubs. However, there will be many associates who will continue to work remotely by choice and only be in the office when necessary or convenient. As mentioned, one of our key COVID-19 era priorities is to focus on doing our part to help our communities and governments mitigate the spread and impact of the virus. Earlier this year, we announced plans to contribute $10-plus million to support pandemic response efforts around the world. In that spirit, we have already deployed millions of dollars to support non-profits that are providing critical services such as hospitals and other healthcare organizations, as well as those focused on basic services such as food banks. We are also donating more than one million masks across North America in support of elder care facilities. Finally, we have initiated a $5 million employee relief fund to help our own associates and their families around the globe who have encountered severe financial hardships in connection with the pandemic. In addition to cash contributions, we have formed a task force that is focused on leveraging our people’s time and talents to create innovative solutions aimed at COVID-19 relief. An example of this is our partnership with Ford and 3M to design and produce lithium-ion powered respirators. And lastly, we are teaming up with private sector organizations such as the U.S. Chamber, the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers, as well as with individual state and local governments in support of their efforts to battle the virus. Our philanthropic work here is never done and we are all in working to do our part in living our purpose. And now I would like to comment on our position regarding racial justice. On June 3rd, in the wake of the brutal slaying of George Floyd, I issued a statement on behalf of the company. I will share some brief excerpts from that statement. Quote, there is no place in society for this type of racism and brutality. We are for those who demand justice, take a stand for equality and commit to inclusivity for all. We have seen anguish and unrest resulting from racism and implicit bias. The deep-rooted history of these truths is real. We stand to do better. We intend to listen, understand and take action for the African-American community within Stanley Black & Decker and at large, end of quote. We are committed to doing a part to level the playing field. Since early June, our senior executives including me, as well as our non-executive Board members have had extensive dialogues with our black associates to build a shared understanding of their experiences with racism and bias to determine concrete actions we can take to address equality, equal opportunity, career advancement, diversity and inclusion as we committed. We have commissioned a task force, which has recently made substantive recommendations, which we will move forward with in the second half and beyond, and many of these actions will have benefits that will spillover to other diverse cohorts as well and we see an opportunity for real positive change going forward. So I hope that summary gives you a window into what we have been doing to effect positive change during the busiest, most productive and most challenging environment we faced during my tenure. We feel really positive about what our team has accomplished and how the company is positioned to deal with, both the opportunities and the challenges ahead. And I will now turn it over to Don Allan to provide the business details for second quarter, as well as a deep dive into our scenario planning for the back half of 2020. Don?
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the second quarter. Tools & Storage revenue declined 16% as volume was down 16%, currency contributed an additional one point of pressure, while the impact to price was a positive 1%. The positive impact to price was driven by the benefits from our actions in response to continued tariff and currency headwinds. The operating margin rate for the segment was 17%, flat to the prior year with the benefits from productivity, cost control and price offset the impacts from lower volume, tariffs and currency. The segment delivered decremental margins in the teens, which is an outstanding result and a reflection of a strong operational performance by the Tools & Storage team. They were quick to execute on the cost actions and productivity opportunities, while also demonstrating excellent agility by responding to the higher North American demand levels that emerged in the middle of the quarter. So let’s now take a look at the regions for Tools & Storage and starting with North America, which was down 10%. U.S. retail was flat organically as channel inventory reductions early in the quarter were offset by the strong underlying demand trends that emerged in mid-April. This demand inflection was primarily driven by a DIY phenomena that started shortly after the lockdowns emerged. The end-users refocus on the home has increased activity levels for our categories resulting in historically high POS levels. We experienced multiple weeks that demonstrated POS growth in the 30%s, 40%s or even over 50%. While we do not know the duration of this trend, we can report that the strong POS has continued into the first four weeks of July. More details on these July trends a bit later in my presentation. Additionally, retail customer store inventories are now at historically low levels, and therefore, we are well beyond the Q2 inventory corrections with our North American retail partners and are currently experiencing shipment growth in line with POS demand. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the U.S. commercial and industrial tool channels experienced more significant organic declines, down 44% and 25%, respectively, due to the impacts from shutdowns and reduced construction activity. We saw some positive indications in June, as re-openings occurred and activity resumed within our more pro focused end markets. But we expect a slower recovery in these channels compared to the incredibly strong result in retail. Europe started the quarter very slow as revenues declined by approximately 45% in April, improved during May and by June revenues were flat versus prior year, resulting in a decline of 21% for the full quarter. The U.K., France and Southern Europe led the declines, while the Nordics with limited shutdowns posted high single-digit growth. With all major European markets reopened by June, we saw improved demand, which has continued into July. The emerging markets were down 29% in the quarter, as these regions were significantly impacted by customer closures and government restrictions implemented to control the virus. All regions were -- within emerging markets declined. Asia improved sequentially from the first quarter but was still down 20% organically. There were a few bright spots with South Korea and Vietnam showing double-digit growth. Latin America saw the most meaningful impacts down 38%, driven by significant declines in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. The performance during the quarter was very choppy and the environment remains more challenging than the other regions as the virus impacts are still very prevalent in Latin America. That gives all of you some interesting details on a geographic basis for Tools & Storage. Now let’s take a quick look at the second quarter performance by SBU. Power tools and equipment declined 9% as continued momentum behind commercial execution and new product introductions were more than offset by the volume impacts from the pandemic. Hand tools, accessories and storage declined 23% due to steep declines in our industrial tool channels and international markets, which this SBU has more exposure to. This SBU also dealt with some, obviously, some difficult comp dynamics associated with last year’s fantastic Craftsman rollout. Both of these SBUs benefited from positive global trends in e-commerce and DIY, e-commerce continues to grow rapidly and it represented nearly 15% of the global 2Q Tools & Storage revenue. With our leading global market position in e-commerce and our strong stable brands, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on these two accelerating trends. As we look ahead, we are making additional targeted investments to further maximize these significant market opportunities as they continue to gain momentum. For example, we see opportunity to expand our e-commerce initiatives into several key geographies where our current presence is limited, and of course, we have the exciting Black & Decker initiative in North America, which we just began about a year ago, which will leverage both the e-commerce and DIY trends. The Tools & Storage team did an amazing job managing the business to an incredibly turbulent period of time and demonstrated great flexibility and agility, a fantastic outcome given the environment they needed to navigate. Let’s shift to the industrial segment. Total growth was negative 20%, which included a 10-point benefit from the CAM acquisition, offset by a 29% volume decline and a negative 1 point from currency. Operating margin rate was down year-over-year to 8.8%, as the impact from volume declines was partially mitigated by cost actions. Engineered Fastening organic revenues were down 35%, driven by lower global light vehicle and general industrial production. The declines were broad based with all regions impacted. As you would expect, automotive fasteners and systems experienced a 43% decline as global light vehicle production was down 47% in the quarter. The general industrial markets remain weak, but the declines in our industrial fastener business were less severe, only down 24%, as it benefited from serving essential industries, as well as the return of manufacturing activity in May and June. Broadly across our regions and end-markets, underlying demand improved each month of the quarter. Therefore, we currently believe 2Q represented the trough for this business and recovery will continue to build momentum, now that global automotive production and general industrial activity have resumed. The infrastructure businesses declined 19% in the second quarter due to lower volume in oil and gas, which was down mid-single digits and a 25% organic decline in attachment tools. While this overall segment was particularly hard hit with factory closures and reduced industrial activity, the teams worked hard to manage cost and limit decremental margins that they prepare to participate in a recovery going forward. I would like to call out the attachment tools business specifically for their agility. Even with the steep market driven declines, which I mentioned 25% down, they were able to maintain a mid-teens operating margin rate for the quarter, well done. Finally, I will review the security segment, which was another positive within the quarter, as they performed better than initial expectations. Revenue declined 11% as volume was down 9%. They also had a 1 point negative impact from divestitures, a 2 point decline from currency and price was a positive 1%. North America organic growth declined 7% and Europe was down 10% as all businesses were impacted by government and customer restrictions, which were more pronounced clearly earlier in the quarter. We saw this dynamic improve in May and June, allowing us to perform more installation and maintenance activity. Backlog remains in a healthy position. It is up 16%, positioning us well for continued improvement in the back half of 2020. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin was down 160 basis points to 9.6%, as price and cost control were more than offset by lower volume. This is a strong performance for security as they implemented swift cost control actions and were able to pivot to increase demand as things shifted in May and June. We also believe that the security business can now energize its commercial activities around new transformational revenue opportunities related to safety, such as proximity, entry and identity management software solutions. We believe these growth opportunities will help us take the business transformation to the next level in the coming year or two. So in summary, the second quarter was a challenging environment as we navigated the pandemic, but thankfully less extreme than feared. The outperformance to our initial expectations was a result of our team’s resiliency and strong operational execution, enabling us to deliver approximately $175 million in cost actions and productivity opportunities, which helped to minimize our decremental margins to 25%, which were close to 10 points better than initial perspective. Let’s now briefly look at our free cash flow performance and a refresher on liquidity on the next page. On a year-to-date basis, our use of cash is $224 million, which is $107 million behind the prior year. The primary drivers are lower earnings, as well as the working capital decisions that we made to ensure we are prepared for potential second half improvements in demand, primarily related to strong Tools & Storage U.S. retail trends. Lower capital expenditures partially offset these impacts reflecting our focus on capital conservation and maintaining a robust liquidity position as we navigate the current environment. In terms of our liquidity and balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $860 million of cash on hand. Our strong investment-grade credit rating continues to provide us with the uninterrupted access to commercial paper. Following the successful remarketing of our preferred equity units in May, we used the $750 million of proceeds to pay down the short-term debt. We now currently have approximately $2.3 billion of capacity on our $3 billion CP program. As you can see, we have maintained enough flexibility from a liquidity standpoint, with a total potential of $3.2 billion available, as of quarter end. As a reminder, we do not have any long-term debt maturities coming due until the fourth quarter of 2021. Our capital deployment priorities remain focused on debt repayment and achieving our leverage targets. To support these priorities, we have kept in place our planned 2020 capital expenditure reductions and are continuing to suspend M&A and share repurchase activity for the time being. Also, as a reminder, the company withdrew its full year guidance in April, as a result of the uncertain macro environment and we will continue to refrain from providing such guidance at this time. Similar to April, I would now like to provide some insights on our second half scenario planning, as well as recent trends and revenue. While we have a much better appreciation for the depth and duration of the trough across our businesses, the trajectory of the economic recovery remains uncertain. As such, we are preparing for a variety of demand scenarios that may occur and we will remain flexible in our approach. The left-side of this page provides a segment view of our second half organic growth planning assumptions. And our June and July forecasted shipment trends, as well as our color -- as our color on the region or sub business performances relative to the recent trends. We also show some other recent key trends on the right side of the page, which are providing us additional insights into our potential second half revenue performance. For Tools & Storage, our planning assumption for second half organic growth ranges from negative 3% to a positive 4%. A key factor in this range is the sustainability of the very strong growth in U.S. retail demand, that’s largely been driven by the surge in DIY and e-commerce. As mentioned earlier, we have seen record POS and it continues into July. POS was up 33% versus the prior year in the first four weeks of Q3. If these trends continue, you can clearly see a line of sight to positive growth for the segment in the back half. So we are watching the U.S. consumer trends very closely. We are also watching the potential for the extending of the stimulus packages, here in the United States, and finally, looking at the continued return of our pro focused activity, which all of these could help support or sustain these recent trends. The remaining portions of the tool business, such as our U.S. commercial and industrial channels, as well as international operations all carry deeper troughs within Q2. Many are on a recovery trajectory and the slope of that improvement will also influence the high and the low-end of this range. Europe Tools & Storage has seen strong performance over the past eight weeks with organic growth in the high single digits. Asia clearly is further along than Latin America in this recovery. However, Latin America, which now much better than the depth of the downturn, continues to be very slow as far as its improvement trajectory, as the region addresses that spread of the virus and has difficulty in containing it. Our midpoint for the Tools & Storage second half organic growth assumes, one, POS continues to moderate from current levels but still strong for the entire second half of 2020, two, Europe continues to see growth but slightly moderated versus the last eight weeks, and three, U.S. commercial and industrial, as well as emerging markets are slow to recover. The recent revenue performance in the segment revealed a strong organic growth rate globally of 8% for the last eight weeks, which likely supports a view that tools is trending towards the high-end of the planning assumption range. For industrial, our planning assumption is an organic growth range that is down 25% to 15% in the second half of 2020. This business is facing some of the company’s most difficult end markets. The last eight weeks, the shipment trends were down 23% organically. Our midpoint of the above mentioned range would assume continued improvement across Q3 and Q4 from what we believe to be the trough in the second quarter. As you look at the business trend over the last eight weeks, we see that Engineered Fastening is tracking in the low 20s as both auto and industrial focused markets continue to gradually improve. Another trend to look at in assessing our view on the auto portion of Engineered Fastening is that light vehicle production is down approximately 17% for the last eight weeks. The attachment tool trends are negative high-teens, while oil and gas and aerospace fasteners on a pro forma basis are weaker than the planning band of a negative 25% to 50% for the whole segment. Given all these facts in the industrial area, it appears this segment is currently trending to the midpoint of the planning range. For security, we expect this business to be relatively stable and continue its improvement trajectory with a second half range of down 8% to flat. This business is demonstrating a 4% decline in the last eight weeks, so continues to show improving trends. Although, the recovery is mixed by country, backlog remains strong which supports an opportunity for sequential improvement with installation and maintenance activity. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, new security and safety needs in factories, offices and healthcare environments emerging from the virus should create exciting new revenue opportunities for the business to capitalize upon starting in the back half of the year. As you aggregate these planning range assumptions for the total company, we see three scenarios. First, on the low-end, we see the potential for a 7.5% organic revenue decline in the back half. This would represent a choppy recovery for our end markets. For this to occur, we would have to see significant moderation in POS trends for North American tools and slower recovery trajectories in all the different areas of the company. Our base case, which is the midpoint, is down organically just below 4%. This represents a broad continuation of recovery trends across the businesses and continued strength in Tools North America, particularly in the third quarter. As it relates to the third quarter, this scenario embeds low to mid single-digit growth within Global Tools, sequential improvement versus 2Q within security and industrial growth that declines in the low 20s. Finally, our high scenario or improving case is relatively flat organic revenue performance in the back half of the company. Broadly this would assume slightly more accelerated recovery scenarios within the businesses and North American retail POS trends continuing at very strong levels through the fourth quarter. Our company organic revenue trend in the last eight weeks is modestly positive. So this is one factor that makes us feel that this optimistic scenario is possible, however, not quite probable at this stage. While this is a broad range versus our normal environment for revenue, we feel it’s prudent to prepare for all of these scenarios, both to ensure that we have sized our cost base appropriately for the pessimistic end of the range and to ensure we are prepared in our supply chain if the markets are better. Moving to the cost reduction program slide, first, I want to remind you how we are approaching this initiative. We have targeted four areas of opportunity within our cost reduction program, indirect spend, compensation and headcount, employee benefit modifications, and raw material deflation. We see this as a $1 billion savings opportunity over the next 12 months, with $500 million benefiting this year. Approximately 60% of this is made up of indirect spend and deflation, with the balance consisting of compensation and benefit actions. We got off to a fast start in the program in the second quarter and we are approximately $50 million ahead from an execution perspective. This was the result of a swift implementation across the entire company. At this point, we are maintaining our 2020 estimate of $500 million of savings, which implies that we should realize about $325 million in the second half. As you think about the total program over the next 12 months, we are still on track to deliver $1 billion. The organization has been working diligently on ensuring that these cost actions are highly sustainable heading into 2021. As Jim mentioned in his opening remarks, we are converting a significant portion of the temporary compensation actions, such as furloughs and reduced work weeks to permanent actions. While a very difficult decision, this was needed to prepare the business for what remains an uncertain demand environment and it removes the significant uncertainty for many of our employees who are impacted by these temporary actions, which were approximately 10,000 employees. It will also help ensure our compensation related actions are sustainable and we will have no snap back as we look into 2021. As it relates to indirect spend, the teams currently have about half of the savings identified as sustainable. We are working to push this higher potentially up to 75%. Based on external research for these types of programs, a very good result is 50% sustainability and 70% will be a best-in-class result. So this is a significant amount of forward progress as it relates to the implementation and sustainability of our cost program. At this point, we feel that two-thirds of the $1 billion program can be permanent. This would result in a positive 2021 carryover or tailwind of approximately $150 million. So now let’s address decremental margins for 2020. We are assuming we can limit the decremental margins net of cost cutting to the mid- to high-teens in our base case. Clearly, this is a volume dependent and you can see better decremental margins potentially mid-teens in our improved case. If we experience a choppy recovery, they could potentially be 20% to 21% this year. As a reminder, our decremental margin performance peak to trough during the last two recessions was contained to mid- to high-teens, so these are very relevant compared to our current 2020 view. I would like to wrap-up my comments by summarizing our 2020 planning assumptions on slide 10. From a revenue perspective, we see the potential for a range of down 7.5% to flat for second half organic revenue, which puts the full year decline in a range of 5% to 10%. Our planning assumptions limit decremental margins, net of cost savings to mid- to high-teens for the full year 2020, with a range of outcomes dependent on volumes, as I just mentioned. From a cost structure perspective, we have $180 million of savings included in our estimate or range assumptions our -- from our Q4 2019 cost reduction program and expect an additional $500 million from the cost actions announced last quarter. Tariffs and FX are currently expected to be $180 million headwind, with $115 million of that behind us in the first half. Finally, as you see in the middle of this page, we have disclosed our planning assumptions for the below the line items. So as you work through your models of various business scenarios please utilize this information. From a cash perspective, our focus is capital conservation and deleveraging. We are maintaining our capital expenditure reductions in our temporary suspension of M&A and share repurchase activity. We will keep a sharp focus on working capital management and have aligned our supply chain with the recent trends and will modulate accordingly based on the trajectory of the recovery. We believe we are continuing to take the appropriate actions given the current environment and we are maintaining our approach to planning around a range of outcomes. Should growth or cost savings track ahead, we will remain flexible and reinvest in key areas, which could enhance growth in the short-term and mid-term. We are prepared to react and respond as recovery continues either at a rapid pace, a choppy pace or any scenario in between. Thank you and I will now return it back to Jim.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Don. We continue to execute on a number of outstanding growth catalysts, which position us for continued market share gains, as well as buffering the shocks of a volatile global economy, like, we are experiencing in 2020. The Craftsman brand remains a key element of our growth strategy and we continue to see a strong customer response, excellent growth and remain well on our path towards $1 billion. This brand, with its enduring value proposition, is well-positioned to benefit from the positive trends we have seen in North American DIY. We are continuing to invest in our innovation machine, bringing the new core and breakthrough innovations to market, and most recently, our DEWALT product line has had innovations that span the power spectrum. DEWALT, ATOMIC and XTREME provide the highest power to late ratio tools in the market, while FLEXVOLT is reaching up into higher power categories where we continue to introduce new tools that are cordless for the first time. And during 2019, we also closed on a 20% stake in MTD Holdings, a leading outdoor power equipment manufacturer. This is an exciting opportunity to increase our presence in both the gas and electric outdoor power equipment markets, with the first opportunity to purchase the remaining 80% beginning in the middle of 2021. MTD continues to make progress on improving their operating margins and is also benefiting from the focus on the Home & Garden nesting phenomenon that has emerged in recent months. And as I mentioned earlier, downturns are a time of opportunity, as well as a time of disruption. So, for example, we are the tools industry leader in e-commerce with global 2019 online revenues of $1.3 billion. But with a sudden acceleration and a shift to e-commerce, our growth opportunity here has become immense. To put it in perspective, it took a decade for e-commerce to become 10% of our revenue, and almost overnight, it grew to nearly 15% of sales and is increasing quickly, with our market position, brands, digital capabilities and global customer relationships, what a great opportunity to build upon our strengths in this area. With its excellent margins, this is one of the major growth areas that will attract significant new investment from us in the second half and beyond. And in a matter of months, society has discovered a newfound obsession with health and safety. This in turn has thrust our security business with its healthcare, electronic security and automatic doors businesses, smack in the middle of a new growth landscape. For example, we are commercializing new solutions such as automated entrance management with temperature monitoring, contact and proximity tracing, and touchless stores for commercial buildings and manufacturing plants. We are allocating resources to scale these solutions and benefit quickly from these new sources of potential growth. We expect all of these growth catalysts, which include exercising our option to acquire the remaining 80% of MTD, most likely in early 2022 to contribute $3 billion to $4 billion of incremental annual revenue beginning in 2022, a great long-term growth story as we look ahead to the future. So in closing, we are delighted with the second quarter performance under the circumstances. We were able to quickly pivot to serve a rapidly improving demand environment and weathered in good stead what we currently believe to be a trough revenue performance for the year, maintaining an intense focus on cost control and delivering on the improved demand trends within the quarter, we are able to limit the impact to our margin rates and deliver $1.60 of EPS. Unfortunately, we were in a strong position going into the crisis, and with the dedication and commitment of our talented, diverse management team and all of our great people are taking the necessary actions to stay strong during the crisis and to emerge from it even stronger. We are now ready for Q&A Dennis. Thank you.
Dennis Lange: Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Don.
Jim Loree: Hi Nigel.
Don Allan: Good morning.
Nigel Coe: Hi. So I want to start off with the, first of all, thanks for details, these are fantastic on the second half of the year. On decremental margins, I just want to confirm the FY’20, mid- to high-teens commitment, implies second half closer to low- to mid-teens, I think, if we have taken the 24% decremental in the first half of the year, is that correct, number one? And number two, assuming that industrial is going to be a bit fresh in the back half of the year, it seems to imply that tools margins potentially up in the back half of the year. I just want to make sure that we think about this correctly? Thanks.
Jim Loree: Yeah. So, on your first question, that’s an accurate kind of view of the decrementals in the back half. Yeah, I think, the margins for industrial will be a very pressured especially in the third quarter, but get better in the fourth quarter, but they still won’t be improving year-over-year, but at this stage, we do think tool margins will be improving in the back half year-over-year. But probably will be more improvement in Q3 than Q4 right now, due to various comp and other matters, but also our insight for Q3 is very clear versus the insight for Q4 is still a little unclear. So that’s probably another factor in that analysis as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: Hey, everybody. Good morning. Nice job on the second quarter.
Jim Loree: Hi, Tim.
Don Allan: Hi, Tim.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Tim.
Tim Wojs: Just my question is on inventory really within the tools business. Just wondering if you could provide just color on where you think channel inventory is relative to normal. And as you are talking to your customers, just how long do you think it takes back to get to whatever, I guess, is normal? Just -- it seems like it could be a multi-quarter tailwind if you are only shipping the POS now. So just some color there on what you think inventory levels are relative to normal and how long it could take to get back?
Jim Loree: Yeah. I mean, inventory levels are exceedingly low and pretty much as low as I have seen in my time here. And I think the customers would probably prefer to have higher inventories, if they could. But as you pointed out, we are simply keeping up with POS right now. We were fortunate that we built a pretty substantial amount of inventory early in the quarter when we started to see, the POS dramatically outperform the shipments and the customers in the beginning of the quarter were still in the process of an inventory correction themselves and then it took them a while to realize that the POS needed to be replenished like ASAP in the middle of the quarter and the orders started rolling in, probably in the back half of the quarter. But by then, with our supply chain cycle time, we are fortunately producing sufficient inventory to at least keep up with the POS and actually it took us a while to get to the point where we were keeping up with POS. There was substantial inventory drain in the channel throughout the quarter stabilizing pretty much near the end and then has been stable for several weeks now.
Don Allan: Yeah. And my comments in the script, and what Jim said, we don’t want to leave the impression that the inventory levels are so low that it’s causing major issues with the end-user. But then when you look at the weeks of stock and you look at the typical range of anywhere from nine weeks to 15 weeks depending on customer, we are definitely at the very low end of that range and so that’s a factor in as we think about going forward. And we are producing enough products in the tool space that if there is a desire of our customers later in the year to restock. We will have the ability to do that, even if the POS continues to run at the levels it’s trending at now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Your line is open.
Markus Mittermaier: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone and thanks for the scenario. Very…
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Markus Mittermaier: Hi. Very, very helpful. Can I ask about the positive carryover into 2021 that you mentioned the 150 million? Just confirming that this is pre any of the supply chain changes and potential cost savings that you might have from that by rearranging the China supply into Europe and the U.S.? So that would be incremental on top of that and then like is there any change maybe pulling that plan a bit more forward in time, would be great if you could elaborate on that? Thank you. 
Don Allan: Yeah. I mean, maybe the best way to answer that question, because it’s a very good question is that, if you think about our margin resiliency program, which Jim commented on related to how it contributed to this year’s cost actions. We still think there’s a great deal of value going forward in that program and we believe this a range of $300 million to $500 million of opportunity that we can capture over the next three years to four years. And part of that will be what you are talking about really shifting the supply chain and the value opportunities that happened there associated with that. There’s also many other things associated with Industry 4.0, advanced analytics, better pricing, analytical and technology tools. I mean, our organizations have really digitized themselves and the supply chain continues to do that to really create more value on a go-forward basis. So one of the really positives that’s coming out of this crisis is that we are not like depleting our margin resiliency value creation. We still see a great deal of value going forward. And at this point, I would just assume it’s probably $100 million to $150 million per year for the next three years, starting next year. We will certainly refine that as we get closer to the end of this year. But -- that is an opportunity that we will continue to pursue, and as you can see, there are a lot of values still associated with it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
Nicole DeBlase: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Jim Loree: Good morning. 
Don Allan: Good morning.
Nicole DeBlase: So, I am going to ask one really easy question and so I was hoping maybe you could make an exception and answer two for me. First, on just the cost savings the remaining 3, -- what is it $325 million for the rest of this year. How does that split between 3Q and 4Q? And then, I guess, my bigger question is, when we think about the DIY potentially, I guess, as people go back to work. What’s the potential that that could be offset by the pro coming back as that is kind of compensated?
Don Allan: Yeah. The first one is it’s a pretty even split between Q3 and Q4 and then I will pass your second question over to Jim.
Jim Loree: Yeah. I mean, actually, I think they are both relatively easy questions, because, clearly, the DIY fade is something that makes logical sense. When you take into account the factor, even if there is a stimulus, which I suspect there will be, it will be a lower dollar amount than we have seen thus far, and so, I think, that there probably will be some POS fade. I just -- it’s unsustainable to keep circa 40% POS going for a long, long period of time. So, yeah, I think that’s probably going to happen. But the pro has been pretty much on hold very, very quiet in terms of what we are seeing there, and of course, with the housing market potentially heating up here and if the urbanization and so forth, it’s likely to go on and starting to go on, likely to continue and so forth. I think we are going to see a fair amount of pros coming back into the mix from the sidelines. So I think there is some potential that that could happen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on all the results and the efforts so far.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Michael. Thanks.
Michael Rehaut: I had a question around the cost savings program. Wasn’t sure, when you talked about still reiterating the $4 billion [ph] of savings -- $1 billion of savings and $500 million in 2020, from what I understand a portion of both of which is the temporary actions that you had said prior to this call is maybe about 30% of the overall total. At the same time, you are talking about welcoming back 9,000 employees, which is wonderful, but it’s -- I understood that part of that was perhaps part of the temporary actions. So just trying to get a sense for and then you talked also about the carryover at $150 million, which is close to that two-thirds of the overall actions being permanent. So just trying to get a sense for the remaining third, how that flows through and maybe the timing of that, if perhaps the solve in kind of talking about working to get those type reactions permanent. But it doesn’t seem like maybe in the next six to 12 months, you will get that $4 billion, if I am understanding that right, but perhaps, you could walk us through that?
Don Allan: I think the way to think about it, Michael is that, if we got the $4 billion obviously, we have another $0.5 billion of incremental benefit in 2021. But we do recognize that that’s probably not likely that we are going to get that type of carryover. Because we are going to have some of these temporary things that come back into our systems such as, we have suspended certain employee benefits as an example, that’s going to be something we can tolerate as an organization for one year. But we can’t continue that into next year, so that will be something that comes back into our cost base. We did some of these temporary compensation things that we are reversing for the reasons we articulated, which will create kind of an incremental cost next year year-over-year. But then we are shifting into -- and we have some things in indirect that we did temporarily this year that will increase in our cost base next year. But then what we are doing is we are focusing in other categories where we are taking permanent headcount actions here right now through, as Jim mentioned, into September timeframe. That would kind of help offset a portion of that. And then, we also are trying to sustain some of these indirect savings, so they are permanent. And so ultimately, when you look at the $1 billion that we have gone after, we think we found $650 million of it roughly that is permanent. And when you do all the math of all those pluses and minuses, and Dennis can give you a little more detail off-line, if you would like. You are going to get a situation where you get a value of $500 million this year, it’s incremental over last year and you are getting at a value of $150 million incremental next year over this year and that’s really how it works.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Julian Mitchell: Maybe just a question around the tools margins for the medium-term. So looking at your guidance, it looks like the tools margins are back to that sort of 17% plus level in Q2 and the second half. Historically, that’s where they have kind of peaked out. So I just wondered, as we look ahead, what type of incremental margins should we expect in tools when sales growth resumes. And do you think that in the medium-term an operating margin aspiration of sort of 19%, 20% or so is realistic given the margin resiliency efforts, so pushing through higher than those old peaks?
Jim Loree: Yeah. And we are very, very pleased with the tools margins in this quarter, because they are pretty much at what have historically been peak levels at a time when revenue is in what we think is a trough in the cycle. So, yeah, I mean, I think, that’s a very significant probability that they will accrete upwards. There are a lot of positive things that Don has talked about. And I have referred to relative to the impact on margins from the cost reductions, from margin resiliency, et cetera. And so I think it hopefully will foretell a very positive story in the future. And I think equally important is the lack of what we have had over the past few years, which have been really significant headwinds from the dollar -- the strength of the dollar, which is now kind of backed off a bit and hopefully will continue along those lines for a while. And also the tariffs are kind of anniversarying out here as we speak in the next quarter and inflation has turned into some deflation. So there are a lot of powerful things happening in the tools margin story that I think bodes very well for it going forward. There’s always going to be new headwinds over time. So we can’t get crazy about it, but clearly, the momentum is upward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Deepa Raghavan: Hi. Good morning all. Can you talk to…
Jim Loree: Hi.
Deepa Raghavan: …what kind of initiatives are being taken other than just expanding -- other than just taking more -- taking the rest of the stake in MTD? If you can just focus on what kind of verticals or end markets, probably, perhaps, is it more DIY focused, maybe COVID-proof products, more eco -- more e-commerce friendly, et cetera? And just a broader question tagging to that is, in the process of managing through COVID, did you discover any new adjacent markets or newer opportunities you can expand into? Thank you. 
Jim Loree: Yes. That’s great. It’s a great question. And it’s -- I was trying to kind of get at that with -- when I talked about the trends that had occurred with the advent of COVID. The first being the sudden shift into e-commerce and -- in terms of the revenue weighting and the consumer preferences. And then in addition to that, you have this kind of re-imagination and re-acclimation to the home. People spending time at home, doing projects at home and then also out in the garden and landscaping, so a lot of the DIY in that area. I think that’s going to be a relatively, I will call it, a semi-permanent trend, which means, probably, for at least a couple of years, we will see that, and then finally, the obsession with health and safety. So all of those things play to our portfolio with the world’s leading, certainly, world’s leading tool business in a great position in e-commerce and in DIY both in the U.S. and in North America and in Europe. And then the MTD acquisition, which hopefully we will be able to do in early 2022, that’s going really well in terms of the cost takeouts that we had -- are working with MTD on, making sure their margins get up to acceptable levels and also from a revenue point of view, MTD is doing quite well as well with significant growth at this period of time. So that’s going to be a great story and that’s probably going to be about $3 billion when we exercise that option of revenue that we are going to bring on probably at a weighted multiple when you take into account the first 20% and then the second 80% will weighted multiple, probably be in the 7 times to 8 times EBITDA range, which is going to be just fantastic. And then the security business, because of this newfound obsession with health and safety, the security business, which has what is today a relatively small but extremely sophisticated healthcare business that serves acute care facilities and elder living facilities and has very sophisticated technology in terms of IoT in particular in artificial intelligence using that business to help with contact tracing and other relevant healthcare applications and one of them being to the protection of elders in these elder care facilities, which as we all know is one of the great tragic stories of COVID-19. Most stakes are running around 50% plus of their deaths associated with elder care facilities. So we are going to be trying to help out with that as a social kind of project to help deal with safety in elder care facilities. And then the electronic security business, which, for a long time, has been on the bottle, if you will, certainly has now moved into the strike zone in terms of strategic relevance with all of its applications that relate to health, safety and security. So, yes, I think, it’s a really great time for our portfolio based on what we see out there in the world today.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for any closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We would like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-30 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2020 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is now recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2020 first quarter conference call.  On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO, and Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11:00 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release.  This morning, Jim and Don will review our 2020 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in our 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
James Loree: Thanks, Dennis. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin with a short passage from our most shareholder letter.  "The new decade is upon us, and with it comes a host of new challenges with the most significant one of them all being something called VUCA, a term which emanated from a Military College in the US in response to the onset of the post-Cold War era. VUCA stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. And while back in that period, VUCA described the backdrop for the formation of a new world order." "This time, I believe it describes what leaders of all institutions will have to consider as we devise strategies and tactics to thrive in what can now be called the New World Disorder of the 2020s. It's an exciting world full of disruptive risks and opportunities, with the accelerating pace of technological change always pushing the limits of what individuals and institutions can absorb." "In 2019, we put much thought into what it will take to win in this environment and we were perhaps blessed by having to deal with the unusually volatile conditions we faced in 2018 and 2019. For structural reasons, our recent external challenges may have been more pronounced than encountered by most diversified global industrials. Ironically, we feel blessed that we have experienced them and endured through them and have now emerged with a fitness and mindset to take on the challenges of the 2020s." I put the finishing touches on that shareholder letter on February 9, several weeks before the devastating impact of COVID-19 began to unfold in real time across the globe. It struck suddenly and jarringly. And while no one could fully understand what to expect next and exactly how it would impact public health policy, consumer behavior, the global economy, our markets, et cetera, our management team truly did have the fitness and mindset to tackle the first great challenge of the 2020s, COVID-19. The VUCA world had arrived earlier and more forcefully than could ever have been imagined.  We acted swiftly and decisively to establish key priorities, including – one – ensuring the health and safety of our employees and supply Chain partners; two, maintaining business continuity and financial strength and stability; three, serving our customers who provide essential products and services to the world; and four, doing our part to help mitigate the impact of the virus across the globe.  These priorities create clarity for our people and our stakeholders in a time of crisis. Through that framework, we empowered our leaders to take the necessary actions to protect our people, our company, our customers, and our communities.  First and most important is the health and safety of our employees and our supply chain partners. As a provider of essential products and services to the world, we have been permitted to continuously manufacture products and provide services in most locations around the globe since the inception of the lockdown.  It began in China with our 10 plants there operating continuously after returning from Chinese New Year in early February. We took extreme measures to protect our 8,000 workers there, including temperature screening, mandatory use of masks and other PPE, social distancing, frequent hand sanitizing and automatic quarantining of anyone exposed to international travel or other high risk situations. In addition, all Chinese employees who were able to work virtually were required to do so.  These precautions were so effective that to date we have had only one known instance of an employee in China testing positive for COVID-19. And she has recovered. That early learning in China proved critically useful to managing safety in our global operations as it enabled us to establish a standardized safety protocol based on applying our China practices as the virus worked its way around the world.  Among approximately 25,000 manufacturing and distribution workers globally, we have had fewer than 50 test positive to date. We track each employee case continuously as it develops.  We've had only a few locations out of our 100 plus factories and DCs with any notable spread, although we have had one where nine cases were detected within a 12-day period. We immediately and voluntarily effected a temporary shutdown of that facility for sanitizing and sent the majority of employees home for a mandatory 14-day quarantine.  For the total company, comprising approximately 58,000 associates, we've had less than 100 employees test positive for COVID-19, a testament to our safety culture and the importance we place on protecting our people.  And while we recognize that the situation can change quickly with respect to this virus, our safety measures are largely working. That health and safety commitment and execution has enabled us to maintain a supply chain that has functioned at a high level thus far during the crisis, providing business continuity, with few and only relatively minor supply disruptions.  This is a day-to-day management process. However, we can say, at this point, so far, so good.  And as for the company, we were in a strong financial position coming into the crisis and we remain strong today. Not surprisingly, we are anticipating the COVID-19 driven demand disruptions will negatively impact our full-year revenue outlook and, therefore, overall financial results in 2020.  And here's what we've seen relative to demand. Overall demand in January and February was consistent with our now withdrawn guidance that was issued in January into March as the lockdown unfolded in Asia, Europe and then the US.  Sell-in volume fell into deep negative territory at levels in the aggregate even deeper than 2008/2009. The automotive industry in Europe and North America essentially shutdown. Commercial aerospace experienced similar dynamics. General industrial orders dried up as plants not providing essential products and services were closed around the globe, and major European countries such as Italy, France and Spain, as well as many in emerging markets basically shut down their discretionary and non-essential economies.  Most states in the US followed suit after California's March 19 stay-at-home order. And North American retail was a bright spot as homebound DIYers flocked to home centers and e-commerce to stock up on tools and other projects supplies, driving positive POS.  Retailers generally took that opportunity to trim inventories, however, creating a large gap between sell-out and sell-in, which has continued into April.  As a result, we recently withdrew our previously announced guidance for the year. And today, we'll be detailing a comprehensive cost reduction and efficiency program that will deliver $500 million of savings in 2020, above and beyond variable cost reductions, and $1 billion over the next 12 months.  The primary focus is to, one, adjust our supply chain and manufacturing labor base to match the current demand environment; secondly, substantially reduce indirect spending; third, reduce staffing in a manner that ensures we're prepared for a demand recovery at the appropriate time; and fourth, capture the significant raw material deflation opportunity that has emerged as the economy has weakened.  I recognize that this is a difficult time to make reduced work decisions that impact employees, but these actions are necessary given the decline in demand we are seeing. And with that said, we are being thoughtful and executing these actions with compassion, as well as consideration to position the company to capitalize on a recovery as the crisis subsides, and subside it will.  We are already seeing greenshoots, suggesting that economies and industries around the world are either rebooting or preparing to reboot in the coming weeks. Home center POS in North America is remarkably positive, as we speak. e-commerce volumes are up in double-digits. European and US auto is preparing to resume production. Governments are beginning to permit non-essential manufacturing to resume, et cetera. All of this suggests that, as we see it today, second quarter will likely be the trough in 2020, albeit a deep one at that.  We believe we have sufficient flexibility to navigate through this volatile period and emerge even stronger on the other side. We have stress-test our business for a wide variety of demand scenarios, and have initiated the necessary actions and contingency plans to maintain a solid financial and operational foundation during this unpredictable period. Don will provide more color and detail on these in a few minutes.  Also important in this crisis is our mission to assist our governments and communities in mitigating the spread and impact of the virus around the globe. In the face of today's challenges, we are seeing the best of humankind – people, businesses, governments, NGOs are coming together. And as an organization, we are taking steps around the globe to do our part.  Now is the time for corporations like ours to demonstrate how we can align our resources to help deliver the innovative solutions and positive societal impact the world needs right now.  We are participating in a number of ways, using our expertise and innovation and our financial and operational resources to be a force for good and make a difference in our communities.  To start, we are contributing to COVID-19 relief funds in the US and globally in support of those who have been catastrophically impacted by the virus. As part of this program, we are matching all employee donations globally two-for-one to help our colleagues make an impact in their local communities.  In addition, we are setting up a relief fund for our own employees and their families to help those who have been severely impacted by the virus and are in need of temporary financial assistance.  We are looking at ways to use our supply chain scale to help acquire critical PPE and other medical equipment that is needed. For instance, we purchased 3 million face masks for philanthropic distribution to vulnerable adult living facility, frontline workers and residents who desperately need protection.  And we have created a COVID-19 response task force comprised of cross-functional leaders throughout our organization that are focused on leveraging their expertise to develop solutions to help combat the virus.  Our teams are working on 3D printing face shields for healthcare workers and have partnered with other companies to develop emergency hand sanitizer supplies, as well as a DEWALT-powered portable battery respirator.  Our teams are supporting those who make the world, especially the frontline caregivers and first responders, the workers in our customers' factories, construction workers and many others. They are each giving it their all to help keep us safe, healthy and functioning well.  Their work contributes to society in so many ways, and our products and services are helping them to do their jobs every day, the people that make the world. Now, I'll turn briefly to first quarter results. Revenues were $3.1 billion, down 6% versus prior year and driven by a 7% organic decline, primarily related to the impacts we experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.20, which was better than otherwise could be expected considering the demand headwinds that emerged in March.  And our business teams are focused on cost control and supply/demand balancing and are realizing the benefits we anticipated with the margin resiliency program.  The strong execution, however, was not enough to overcome the impact from the coronavirus-related volume declines and approximately $60 million of carryover headwinds related to tariffs and currency.  Now, I'll now turn it over to Don Allan to provide the business details for 1Q and a deeper dive into our scenario planning, cost response, capital allocation posture and liquidity picture.  Don?
Donald Allan : Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I hope you are all staying safe and healthy.  Before I take a deeper dive into Q1 results, I just want to share my deep appreciation for all our Stanley Black & Decker employees around the globe, who have been working night and day to keep one another safe, operate our business in this challenging environment and still give back to our communities. Thank you very much.  So, let's move on to Q1. Tools & Storage revenue declined 10%, with volume down 9% and currency contributing an additional 2 points of pressure. Price was a positive 1 point, driven by the benefits from our actions in response to continued tariff and currency headwinds.  The challenging revenue environment as a result of the COVID crisis emerging in Q1 has impacted all Tools & Storage regions and SBUs.  The operating margin rate for this segment was 11.5%, down from the prior year as the benefits from cost control, margin resiliency and price were more than offset by lower volumes due to the virus, tariffs and unfavorable currency.  As the quarter unfolded, we saw the humanitarian crisis from COVID-19 evolve quickly into an economic crisis and started to experience demand impacts in virtually all global markets we serve – first in Asia, then in Europe and finally in North America and the emerging markets. Our planned organic growth for the quarter was relatively flat to a slight decline.  As we detailed in January, we anticipated a difficult comp due to the significant load in of Craftsman in early 2019, as well as softer industrial channels and emerging markets in our guidance at the time. The entirety of the miss versus our plan can be attributed to the impact from the virus. However, our proactive cost control and margin resiliency initiatives were able to significantly mitigate the net operating margin impact from lower volumes.  On a geographic basis, Europe was down 7% as France and Southern Europe led the decline, while the North fared somewhat better, with low-single digit declines as the lockdowns started later. Growth in the European region in the month of February and first two weeks of March was positive, illustrating how quickly trends change during the second half of March.  Emerging markets declined 13%. Asia was hardest hit, down 25%, with Latin America down 12%. All countries in these geographies were down for the quarter except for Russia, Turkey, Colombia and Chile, which are all up low-double digits.  North America was down 8%, with all channels experiencing declines. However, Canada was relatively flat for the quarter.  Similar to the overall segment, we expected North America to be relatively flat due to the Craftsman load-in dynamic. So, the declines for the quarter was largely driven by the virus impact.  From an underlying demand standpoint, retail POS extended the strong double-digit trends from 2019 through much of the quarter. We started to see demand deviations versus our plan around the second week of March as more broad-based shelter-in-place orders went into effect and the month of March POS was relatively flat by the end of the month.  Now, looking at the SBUs. Power tools and equipment declined 3% as early momentum behind commercial execution and new product introductions were more than offset by the later-in-quarter impact from the pandemic.  Contrary to what you would think, the less cyclical hand tools, accessories and storage SBU declined 14%, more extreme because this SBU had a larger benefit in 2019 from the Craftsman rollout.  As we watched the trends in the quarter, e-commerce globally and DIY in many developed markets showed signs of acceleration. As you can imagine, with more people spending extended times in their homes, maintenance and repair work that may have been put off for some time has taken a new priority in the lives of our end users.  Our global position in e-commerce and the reestablishment of Craftsman in the marketplace have benefited us in this particular environment.  Turning to Industrial. The segment delivered 6% revenue growth, which included 15 points from IES Attachments and CAM. Both of those acquisitions. Additionally, we had an 8% organic decline and a negative 1 point from currency. Operating margin rate was down year-over-year to 13.2% as margin resiliency and cost controls were more than offset by the impact from lower volume and currency.  Engineered fastening organic revenues were down 9%. As you would expect, Asia led the declines with auto being more impacted than general industrial customers. We have seen this dynamic emerge in other geographies we compete in as well.  The automotive manufacturers were forced to make tough decisions to close their plants and began shutting them down in Q1 as humanitarian and economic crisis moved across the globe, leading to North American shutdowns late in March.  On a positive front, many of the Chinese auto plants have reopened, albeit at significantly lower volumes, and most of the other auto manufacturers are planning to reopen North American and European plants within the next several weeks.  The commercial model in engineered fastening is sound and we continue to partner with our customers on new content, which we believe will provide a pathway for share gains as production levels improve. We are prepared to ramp up once our automotive customers solidify their new production dates across Europe and North America.  The infrastructure businesses declined 6% as low single-digit growth in oil and gas was more than offset by lower attachment tools volume. Oil and gas benefited from continued growth and inspections, while attachment tools declined in the mid-teens, a relatively similar performance to what we experienced in the fourth quarter.  Through mid-March, Security's organic growth was close to 3% quarter-to-date. By quarter-end, however, the Security segment has declined 4% as organic growth shifted to a negative 2% for the full quarter, a 5 point swing in two weeks as the world shut down and customers were cautious in allowing technicians onsite as they postponed projects. Embedded in that organic growth performance was a 2 point negative impact from divestitures. Security additionally experienced a 2% decline in revenue from currency.  North American Security organic growth was up 2% as higher volumes in automatic doors and healthcare were partially offset by lower installation and service revenue in the commercial electronic security business. Obviously, we are seeing customer accessibility limitations impacting our ability to complete installation orders in this environment.  Europe was down 1% organically due to customer restrictions in France and UK, which more than offset solid growth in Sweden.  The commercial momentum continued with strong order intake and a backlog that is up 20% versus last year. As the restrictions lift in North America and Europe, we are in a good position to continue the organic growth momentum in Security. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin was down 290 basis points to 7.4% as price and cost control were more than offset by lower volume in electronic security, investments to support growth and the impact from the Sargent & Greenleaf divestiture. The volume loss in late March for customer installations was significantly above line average profitability.  So, that is the view of Q1. But now I would like to share our view on the near-term prospects for our businesses. So, as we move to slide 9, today's environment is changing on a daily basis and we are doing everything we can to keep our employees safe and healthy and serve our customers, while we continue to evaluate and prepare for a wide variety of demand scenarios that could occur in 2020 and beyond.  I will start with the left side of the page, which depicts how we expect COVID to initially impact demand. The chart is arranged from the most impacted businesses at the top to what we believe to be the least impacted businesses as we move down to the bottom of the table on this page.  We are seeing that the hardest hit businesses will be automotive and aerospace. Both have seen OEM shut down production. In the case of auto, these end markets were seeing negative trends for much of 2018 and 2019, so this environment has deepened this decline globally. Our customers are at varied stages of restarting in Europe and the United States.  As a reminder, our auto fastening business is 25% CapEx driven, with the remainder based on production. As it relates to our aerospace exposure, it is close to 90% commercial, with the vast majority of that tied to new builds. Finally, we expect general industrial portion of fasteners to be somewhat less impacted as the customer base is diverse and we serve some essential industries that have remained operational during this time.  Turning to Tools & Storage. Market demand is most closely correlated with global GDP and consumer confidence in the served geography. Approximately 85% of our tools are construction oriented, with the remaining 15% serving industrial customers and automotive aftermarket.  As broad-based global shelter-in-place orders were issued, the impact to North American independent construction channels and industrial customers, as well as geographies outside of North America has been very significant.  On the contrary, our major North American retail customers were qualified as essential, which enabled us to continue to serve demand and we are seeing demand acceleration in DIY in the region and e-commerce globally, supporting these trends in North America retail POS for the first four weeks of the fiscal month of April, which was up low-double digits.  However, since about 70% of our products serve the professional, declines in construction and repair activity levels and industrial production are expected to impact demand, while shutdowns remain in place.  Additionally, we are experiencing some inventory corrections in our North American retail partners, as they utilize this crisis to reset store inventory levels by the end of Q2. Our infrastructure businesses have been less impacted today by shutdowns as large construction projects have been able to safely continue. Attachment tools are seeing an impact as OEMs adjust production and customers focus on only the most critical inventory.  Less impacted today is oil and gas as they complete their planned backlog of projects. However, we are expecting a longer-term impact to this business related to the price of oil that would be negative.  Lastly, Security. Generally, this business is rather resilient during recessions because of the significant amount of recurring revenue, and in downturns, we typically see an increase in the demand for security.  The current crisis, however, is challenging this segment in new and different ways. Regional shutdowns are limiting our ability to enter our customers' facilities and complete installation and maintenance orders.  As I referenced earlier, though, the team has seen strong motor trends, which gives us confidence that this business will have significant backlog to convert when the environment improves.  Additionally, we believe new market needs in factories, offices, retail and consumer as well as the healthcare environment should create new revenue opportunities for this business to capitalize upon as we emerge from the crisis.  So, accounting for all these factors, our plans assume a 35% to 45% decline in organic revenue for the second quarter.  As an added disclosure, to provide some more transparency, an indication of our April month-to-date revenue trend in each of our businesses is denoted by the colored balls on the left side of the slide. You can see the actual data is very much in line with how I described the businesses earlier. Aggregate shipments for the company are tracking in line with the midpoint of our planning assumption or about a 40% decline.  One could have the view that the demand impact will be the deepest in the month of April, as the government restrictions are currently very broad and restrictive. If this turns out to be an accurate view, then we would appear to be at or slightly below the 35% end of our range for Q2. However, we think it's too soon to draw definitive conclusions until we better understand the length of the shutdowns and what demand looks like once restrictions ease.  As we look ahead for the full year, we have modeled scenarios that result in a 15% to 30% organic decline in revenue. The key variables driving the range is the depth and the duration of the revenue decline, as well as the timing and the magnitude of the bounce back in 2020.  The high end of the decline would look more like an L-shaped recovery and the shallow end would be representative of a V. Our base case plans for a U-shaped recovery with a few bumps likely along the way, which currently expects 2Q to carry the deepest decline, with the revenue contraction moderating across both Q3 and Q4. We have sized and structured our cost program to address this scenario, and it is relatively similar to the midpoint of these revenue ranges.  However, we've structured our cost program to provide us flexibility depending on the shape of the recovery. Should we see a quicker V-shaped recovery, we can reverse some of these decisions as necessary to support the demand environment as it returns.  However, should we see further deterioration or a more elongated L-shaped recovery, we can choose to make some of the temporary actions permanent, resizing our cost base to reflect the new environment.  Now, turning to more detail on our cost response. As Jim mentioned in his opening comments, we are targeting four areas of opportunity within our cost program. Indirect spend, compensation and headcount, benefits modification and raw material deflation.  This new program expands and incorporates $100 million to $150 million 2020 margin resiliency opportunity I discussed on the January earnings call. However, these reductions are incremental to the headcount reduction program that we implemented in Q4 2019 and included in our guidance in January. We see this as a $1 billion savings opportunity over the next 12 months, with approximately $500 million benefiting this year.  Now, I will dive deeper into each one of these opportunities. First, we are targeting to significantly reduce our $1.7 billion in indirect spend, as we focus on professional services, MRO, T&E, marketing, et cetera.  We're taking a clean-sheet, bottoms-up approach to assessing these spend categories and establish indirect spend control towers, with cost category owners who will be focused on reviewing all proposed spend. The mindset in this environment is to only approve expenditures that are essential to running our business.  Next, based on where commodity prices are in today's environment, combined with the initiatives we are executing within margin resiliency, we believe there's a significant opportunity to capture incremental raw material deflation across our roughly $6 billion of annual spend in finished goods, components, commodities and transportation. This can help offset some of the remaining tariff and currency pressure that we will face in 2020.  Together, these two categories represent about 60% of the $1 billion savings target, which means about 40% is compensation and benefits. Our approach in this area is to ensure that we are preserving our ability to reduce labor costs in a manner that allows us to treat our employees with compassion in these incredibly difficult times, and to prepare us for demand recovery at the appropriate time by making these actions as temporary as possible.  The savings include salary reductions for senior leaders, temporary benefit reductions, such as suspending 401(k) matching in the United States, a voluntary retirement program, furloughs, modified workweeks, and finally, some reductions in force. Today, about 70% of the actions are temporary, specifically the furloughs, pauses in benefits, salary reductions and the like.  As you think about modeling this $1 billion plan, we should start to see some benefit in Q2 related to these actions and approximately $375 million of the $500 million will benefit the second half. One other assumption related to this, we believe approximately 60% of the $1 billion in cost savings is classified as SG&A, with the remainder in cost of sales.  So, that is our plan to address the semi fixed cost base in this environment.  We also have addressed variable spending by adjusting our manufacturing and supply chain to align with the current demand environment. We are taking a similar cost reduction approach in this area, ensuring that we treat our employees with compassion and partnering with our suppliers to provide the right flexibility.  We also are protecting inventory of our highest volume SKUs until we get a sense of the demand progression across the coming months and quarters. We will be leveraging the operations excellence principles in the SPD operating model to ensure we remain agile and efficient, carrying only the levels of working capital required.  As we think about scenario planning and various models, as a reminder, we historically have seen decremental margins around 40% prior to any cost-cutting actions across our businesses. This is a good starting assumption as you plan various demand scenarios.  As I said earlier, we are planning for a U-shaped recovery, with a few bumps likely. And with our cost actions, we believe we can limit the decremental margins to low to mid 20s this year, and better than that across the 12-month period. We currently believe Q2 will likely be the deepest decremental margin as we face deep revenue declines and the cost cutting actions will not see a full quarter impact. So, I've given you quite a bit of detail on how we are tackling the next 12 months. Beyond that timeframe, by design, there will be a snapback in some of these costs if we are in a better demand environment.  In fact, if we find out that we are in a V-shaped recovery in the coming quarters, we may choose to put some of this spending back in place. However, if we find ourselves in an L-shaped recovery where volume stays depressed for a longer period of time, we will make these actions permanent.  We believe we are taking the appropriate actions given the current environment and trying to prepare ourselves for a range of outcomes that gives us the right level of flexibility to react to the recovery in whichever manner it comes.  So, now we'll move to slide 11 and talk about our past performance in previous recessions. In an effort to provide some additional context to our scenario planning, we want to share some information about how we performed in past recessions. I say we as Jim, myself and many members of the management team were a part of the senior leadership of the company during those time periods.  Since we had a major acquisition coming out of the 2008/2009 recession, we have included both SWK and BDK in these metrics. I will focus my comments primarily on 2008 and 2009.  So, from a top line perspective, peak to trough pro forma organic sales declined 23% throughout. The duration of the recessionary period, the average quarterly organic sales decline was 13%, with the deepest quarterly decline being 24%. To get a sense of how the business rebounded coming out of the housing-led recession, we looked at organic growth two quarters after the end of the recession, which returned with 12% growth.  Turning to profit, in both recessions presented on this page, entering the down cycle, decremental margins approximated 40% before cost cutting, which is consistent with what I laid out earlier.  However, we did our best to proactively cut costs during both periods and limited peak to trough decrementals below double digits at SWK in 2001 and to the high teens for the combined company in 2008 and 2009.  At this point, we have limited visibility to the potential length and the depth of the current environment. However, we are approaching this situation drawing on the experience from the past and trying to replicate the track record of performance during downturns.  We feel our approach has served us well to make sure we do what we can to remain agile and resilient as we manage the uncertainty and come out of this crisis stronger, prepared to find more organic and inorganic growth opportunities.  Let's now move to slide 12 and give an update on liquidity. So, a quick update on our liquidity and balance sheet. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $1.7 billion of outstanding commercial paper. This is aligned with normal seasonality we typically see this time of year.  We don't have any long-term maturities coming due until December of 2021, which is $400 million. The next maturity is $754 million in 2022, with the remainder of our long-term maturities in 2026 and beyond. Available liquidity starts with approximately $1 billion of cash on hand as of quarter-end. Leveraging our strong investment grade credit rating, we have had and continue to have uninterrupted access to the commercial paper market since the crisis began. We have about $1.3 billion of available capacity on our $3 billion CP program.  Finally, with the successful remarketing of the 2017 preferred equity units in May, we have the opportunity for an additional $750 million of liquidity.  As you can see, we have significant flexibility from a liquidity standpoint, with the total potential of $3.1 billion all in as of the end of the quarter.  Backing up our robust commercial paper program is $3 billion of revolving credit facilities, which are backed by a well-capitalized diversified banking group.  You may have seen in our 8-K that we issued last night announcing that we have modified the covenant on these facilities to now carry an EBITDA to interest ratio of greater than 2.5 times, with certain one-time expenses excluded from the ratio through 2021. This proactive and prudent action preserves access to liquidity and gives us the flexibility in a period that will carry higher charges related to our cost program.  From a capital deployment perspective, the priority is debt repayment and, in turn, achieving our leverage targets. To ensure we maintain our strong liquidity position and deliver on our capital allocation priorities, we've initiated additional capital conservation actions which included significant reductions in 2020 capital expenditures and a temporary suspension of M&A and share repurchase activity. So, as we move to slide 13 to summarize all this information – we just covered a lot of ground here, so I'll spend a moment to summarize a few key points for 2020. We are continuing to suspend our guidance for now and are experiencing substantial revenue declines early in the second quarter, as I mentioned, which we currently expect will represent the trough quarter for the year.  From a revenue perspective, our planning models assume the potential for a 35% to 45% second quarter revenue decline, with the month-to-date April results tracking in that neighborhood. The future is dependent on countries getting control of the health crisis as all of us now. We have modeled multiple scenarios and currently assumes sequential improvement as we move through the year, with a full-year range of 15% to 30% revenue decline, depending on the shape and the timing of the recovery, as I discussed. Decremental margins pre-cost cutting should be 40% and our cost reductions will attempt to minimize that impact down to the low to mid-20s.  From a cost structure perspective, we had $180 million of savings included in our Q4 2019 cost reduction and are adding an additional $500 million to that in 2020. Tariffs and FX are currently expected to be $150 million headwind, with $60 million of that behind us in the first quarter. From a cash perspective, our focus is capital conservation and deleveraging, as I mentioned. With that comes capital expenditure reductions and temporary suspension of M&A and share repurchase activity. Finally, expect us to target expanding working capital turns versus the prior year. The demand environment will dictate if we see a cash flow positive from working capital liquidation, but as of now we want to preserve sufficient working capital levels to capitalize on a recovery when it presents itself.  As you can see, it's a complex situation. We've never seen this type of humanitarian crisis in our lifetime. But we can draw on our vast experiences where we have successfully navigated this company through 177 years of ups and downs. Our team is actively engaged in managing everything within our control, while also contributing where we can to helping mitigate the spread of this terrible pandemic.  Thank you. And I will now turn it back to Jim.
James Loree: Thanks, Don. It would be easy to lose sight of the opportunities that arise during moments like this, given all the detail and difficult actions that we're taking and we'll continue to take, but I also want to emphasize that we continue to execute on a number of outstanding growth catalysts that we believe will position us to perform in this difficult market environment and beyond. The iconic Craftsman brand rollout continues to have a strong customer response, excellent growth and we remain well on our path towards the $1 billion marker. This brand is well-positioned to capture the DIY and value-oriented professional, a growing market in North America.  Our innovation machine is a strategic differentiator and enables us to generate share gain, with a steady stream of innovation that we bring to the marketplace across our businesses.  More specifically, our recent series of DEWALT product breakthroughs, including FlexVolt, Atomic and Xtreme have been well received by end users and now account for more than $0.5 billion of revenue, with a healthy growth rate, at least pre-COVID-19. And then, lastly, we are the tools industry leader in e-commerce with 2019 online revenues of $1.3 billion. And this global opportunity has outstanding potential for rapid growth in today's environment and in the years to come. And during the last couple of years, we've very methodically expanded this program from a North America focused e-commerce platform to a globally-focused platform with strengths in many, many of markets around the world. It's going to be a huge advantage for us going forward. Of course, during 2019, we closed on that 20% stake in MTD, a leading outdoor power equipment manufacturer based in Ohio. This is an exciting opportunity for us to increase our presence in both the gas and electric outdoor power equipment market.  So, there's a lot to be excited about and our growth teams are not sitting still. We know that when this crisis – this crisis has a potential to create sweeping changes in consumer behavior and user needs and business model requirements. Multiple new growth opportunities will arise from this and we are prioritizing resources to ensure that we're in a position to capitalize on them. So, in closing, COVID-19 has presented us with the first great challenge of the 2020s. And within this uncertain environment, we've aligned our organization around key priorities – health and safety of our employees and supply chain partners being number one, business continuity and financial strength, serving our customers and doing our part to help mitigate the impact of the virus.  We were in a strong position going into the crisis and are taking the necessary actions to stay strong during the crisis and to emerge from it even stronger. Our commitment to safety is rock solid. Our businesses have operated continuously since the inception of the crisis. Our financial strength and liquidity is in great shape and our billion dollar cost reduction and efficiency program has been carefully designed to support financial stability and performance in whatever demand scenario emerges. The vast majority of our customers are either open for business or planning to reopen in the coming weeks. Our growth catalysts are alive and well and we are doing what we can to support our people and our communities around the globe.  So, it is with both realism about the present and cautious optimism about the future that we have the resources, the experience, the strength and the mindset to take on the first great challenge of the 2020s and we're now ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Good morning, Jim.
James Loree: Good morning.
Nigel Coe: Yeah. Thanks for all the details. It's really helpful. And the context around what you expect for 2Q and the full year is very helpful. Not all companies are doing that. So, much appreciated.  We'll take a lot of the details offline with Dennis, but in terms of the cost savings, can you just confirm – I think the answer is yes, but this is additive to the costs savings in train right now. So, this is $500 million plus $200 million. So, it's more like $700 million of cost reduction this year? And then, the second part of the question is, given it's a billion dollars to analyze savings, $500 million for the full year, really, this is second half and not much of this falls into 2Q. Thank you very much.
Donald Allan: Yeah, I'll provide a little clarity on that. So, the $500 million in 2020 related to the billion dollar program is in addition to the actions that we took in Q4 of 2019. So, that's correct.  As it relates to the timing, what I said in my very long script was that $500 million for the year, we think $375 million of that will be in the back half. And so, that obviously gets you about $125 million in the second quarter. And so, that's kind of how it lays out.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. You may begin.
Jeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning. I guess a multipart one from me also. Can you provide a little color on how the manufacturing footprint realignment plays into this, specifically thinking the shift out of China and into the US? And  if I could squeeze a second part in, with sell-out so strong, how long do you think the home center is going to actually draw down inventory before they actually have to kind of hit the reset button to start ordering on the other side? Thank you.
James Loree: Okay. I'll take the second part your question first. Because I think a lot depends on the POS. We're seeing some eye-popping numbers on a weekly basis in a couple of the places. And if that continues, there will be some replenishment that would be advisable, no later than the third month of this quarter, June. So, it's really their decision. They make those decisions in how they want to play their inventory.  I can completely understand the challenge they have, trying to balance the opportunity that might be out there, but they don't know for sure versus the risk of getting stuck with a significant inventory problem if all of a sudden those trends change. So, it's just a balancing act and it's a tight wired one at that.  As far as the manufacturing footprint, it's an interesting question because with virtually 98% of our salaried population stuck in their homes working virtually, it's hard to really execute on these types of projects, in addition to the fact that they can't travel. So, there's a travel ban in place. Like most companies, we have a complete ban on travel. It has very few, if any, exceptions. So, there will be some delays in the footprint program until we're able to travel and that sort of thing. But I think we're talking probably months in terms of delays, but there will also be an acceleration because the importance of making of footprint happen even faster is amplified by the nature of the crisis. So, you end up with a lot of planning going on right now virtually. And then, when we get into the execution, we're going to try to accelerate. Long story short, I think we're going to be looking at roughly the same kind of two to three-year time frame for the moves to be complete.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Timothy Wojs: Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning.
James Loree: Good morning.
Tim Wojs: Appreciate all the details that you've provided. I also have kind of a two-part question. I guess, first, how are you balancing just R&D and innovation and growth investments? So, just specifically, is that something that's been preserved and protected as you've kind of make these cost reductions? And then, second, how should we think about balancing just both production and working capital? I guess, at this point, would you expect working capital to be more released than you thought prior to this or would you expect it to carry that working capital just given the uncertainty around retail stocking levels?
James Loree: I'll take the first part of your question. I'll give Don the second, even though I know the answer to it.
Donald Allan : I know the answer to the first too.
James Loree: Fair enough, Don. We have largely protected any applied innovation. So, there may be some theoretical innovation that we cut back a little bit on, but not much. Some of the programs that are still looking at 5 years out, 6 years, 7, 8, 9, 10 years out in terms of how some of these look like, the construction industry will change and what the impact on our tool business would be and how we're going to manage through all that. That program, for example, is alive and well.  And so, when you think about the nature of the comp and ben reduction, so many of them in this are temporary – 70% are temporary. So, instead of maybe working five days on a project, we're working four, and for a period of time. I think that's the way to think about it.
Donald Allan : Yeah. On the operation side, we gave a lot of thought to how we ramp down the labor force in manufacturing and distribution, and in particular in tools. In engineered fastening, it was fairly straightforward because you had OEMs shutting down and we basically would shut our plant down in a similar correlation and then we'll ramp up a little bit in advance of them ramping up. So, it's fairly straightforward from that perspective. But on the tools side, it's a little bit more complex, especially in North America, in that we have several major customers in retail that are continuing to perform. As we talked about earlier, the POS is very strong through the first four weeks of April.  So, we did a planning assumption around our second quarter revenue decline, but we didn't reduce production to that level. We actually reduced production to a more modified view of that. So, if you look at the – maybe tools being down somewhere 35% to 45% in Q2 like the company, we're probably somewhere between 0% and 35% to 40% is where we cut that production. And so, we recognize the importance of continuing to serve those customers, but also making sure we're prepared as things start to accelerate maybe in June or in the third quarter, whatever the timing is, we're prepared for that.  And given our supply chain, with some of the lead times we have, we have to make sure that we strike that right balance, which we will carry a little higher level of inventory probably through Q2 and Q3 and maybe longer, but I think we're striking the right balance to ensure that we meet our customers' needs now and going forward, but also ensure that we get the right dollar value out of working capital performance in 2020.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congrats on all your efforts so far managing the challenging backdrop.  First question, or I guess my only question, but I do have a clarification question as well if I could, but the core question is just also around some granularity on the cost reduction program. Just trying to understand it relative to the prior margin resiliency efforts. You had noted that it is inclusive of the $100 million to $150 million that you're expecting to realize this year. I was curious if the next two years, that would overall encompass the total number of $300 million to $500 million. If that remaining portions are also included in this $1 billion program or if that's still kind of years out. And then, in terms of the clarification, there are a few different numbers in terms of the sell-in and the sell-out on North American retail. I was hoping if you could just kind of review for March and April so far what you've seen. It is roughly what you had in terms of sell-in and sell-out.
Donald Allan : So, for the sell-in and sell-out, so for March, the POS, as I mentioned in my script, was flat – relatively flat. The POS in April is up low double-digits. So, it's very strong. And the sell-in that we're seeing in the month of April is consistent with what I showed on that chart, which for Tools & Storage is in that ballpark of the 2Q range I mentioned, probably turning towards the lower end of that range. So, that gives you a sense of those aspects.  As far as the cost reduction goes, if we reflect back to the January earnings call, we talked about having $100 million and $150 million of margin resiliency initiatives that weren't in our guidance. They were just there as a contingency, things we were going to execute on as new headwinds came our way. So, clearly, some big headwinds have come our way, much bigger than anyone anticipated, for us and many in the rest of the world.  But when you think about what those opportunities were in margin resiliency, there were things around higher levels of procurement savings due to utilizing technology in certain tools to drive that value.  Using industry for that old technologies around automation and data analytics, artificial intelligence that would drive more value to our manufacturing footprint and eventually into our supply base as well. Those things are not driving a lot of value in the billion dollars. So, those two buckets, in particular, were a large part of our margin resiliency program.  There were other aspects around indirect and a few other things, like functional transformation. Functional transformation will continue to move forward and that'll be a value driver for the next two to four years depending on the function. Indirect, yeah, we're probably pushing a lot of that right now in the next 12 months, but what we need margin resiliency for us is to help us sustain that savings going forward because, right now, what we're doing is really brute force.  So, that's a long-winded answer to your question, but I still think there's a very big opportunity for margin resiliency out there when you think about those different categories and then there's a sustaining aspect around indirect that really helps us keep that significant number that we're getting in the billion dollar program in our P&L, so it doesn't pop up in a very large way in the coming years.
James Loree: And as you can imagine, we really haven't had the opportunity to get into tremendous amount of detail ourselves as we work through this crisis. On that particular question, really just trying to find every cost savings opportunity we could find and we'll go back and do the detailed analysis over the next couple of weeks. In probably the next earnings call, we'll give you a little more granularity around the answer to that question. But as you can see from what Don said, it's partial basically. Partially included, partially not and more to come later.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning.
James Loree: Good morning.
Julian Mitchell: Hey, morning. My first question just really around the free cash flow. You've spent a lot of time discussing the sales and earnings trends and slide 10 was very helpful in that regard for historical context. Just wondered what the historical context was around the free cash flow in downturns and how you think it might be similar or different in this current downturn.  And then, my clarification would just be around – you talked about decrementals all-in this time of, I think, low to mid-20s this year. That's a bit heavier than the last two downturns on slide 10. Is that simply because of the tariff and currency costs? Or is it more about just the sort of starting point, i.e. the notion that this downturn could carry on into next year? Thank you.
Donald Allan: Yeah, sure. Julian, it's really timing. I know I said a lot of things in my script, but as I went through that low kind of 20s for 2020, what I also said is when we when at the full 12 months going into 2021, we actually think we'll get better than that. So, hopefully, we get very close to that high teens number that we saw in the 2008 and 2009 period. What was the first question he had?
Dennis Lange: Free cash flow.
Donald Allan: Free cash flow, yeah. So, free cash flow in recession has actually, from a conversion point of view, performed very well. Obviously, gets impacted by the charges that you put through your net income. You tend to get a good working capital benefit in a recessionary period. Now, this might be a little different. We're trying to manage that, as I mentioned, in my presentation with the right balance because we want to ensure we have enough inventory if the recovery is very quick. And we didn't face that type of challenge as we went through the recession because we don't expect quick recoveries. We expected very slow recoveries. This is a different scenario where you could see a V or, in our case, we modeled a U, and there might be a scenario where stronger growth comes later versus in the short term. And so, I think we have to strike that right balance to ensure that we don't go overboard in working capital. But, overall, I would expect conversion to be strong given the historical dynamics we have seen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, guys.
James Loree: Hey. Good morning.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: I'll try to keep it to a mere 17 part question for mine. Just going back, Jim, to the point you made – or I think it might have been Don – about not just the sell-in versus sell-out, but more that the pros aren't working right now. What do you think those job site closures are costing you? Because I guess New York City and Northern California I think are opening in real time right now for construction sites. So, maybe some light at the end of the tunnel there if you wouldn't mind sizing that. And that's all I have to say.
James Loree: Well, it's interesting to think about it because the pros do a fair amount of shopping at home centers. And so, I think what we're probably seeing is this DIY phenomenon is probably a lot bigger than we suspect because there's a big negative I suspect coming from the pros. They're just not stopping in the contractor's desk as much as they used to right now because the projects aren't active. And so, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what that difference could be because we don't really know how big the DIY impact is. But I think the ballpark, it's probably in the single digits for sure, but probably mid, low single-digits would be my – negative impact would be my guess, but it's a guess.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Your line is open.
Markus Mittermaier: Hi. Good morning. Glad you all are well.
James Loree: Good morning.
Markus Mittermaier: And thanks for all the scenario analysis. Very helpful. One question quickly on your base case. You've talked a lot about decrementals. What I'm wondering is, on the other side, given that you, I think, mentioned in your prepared remarks, indirect cost and deflation is about 60% of the cost-out. How does that compared to the past and what would that mean for incrementals because if 60% of total cost-out, incrementals should be quite interesting. Is that sort of like in a U-shape base case recovery that is outlined?
Donald Allan : Yeah. You're right. it, obviously, depends on what type of recovery we see. If we see a very rapid V recovery in the back half of this year, then the incrementals will change because we will be adding that cost. We have 70% of our comp and benefits costs that we've kind of called temporary at this point, which is 40% of our $1 billion. And we probably wouldn't add it all back, but we'll add some of that back because we have modified workweeks and furloughs and things like that that are happening with the salaried part of our company. And so, that would clearly have a governing impact on incrementals as we grow. That being said, there's a lot of things we can do to continue to drive productivity. We touched on margin resiliency earlier in a question we had from Michael. And those are types of initiatives that have been little bit on hold for a period of time, but they are beginning to re-energize themselves going forward to create the value that we think is there. And so, I actually think the incrementals will see a bit of a governing impact in that recovery, but I think it's something we can manage through. So, it's not too significant.  In a longer period of recovery, where it's a U or even an L, we will be working to make that billion dollars as permanent as possible, which means we could take some of the temporary things and make them permanent or we could take alternative actions to replace some of those temporary things over time. Because if we see that type of recovery where we have a bumpy performance from multiple quarters going into next year, then we're going to probably take the approach of how do we really make the vast majority of that permanent, which would not impact incrementals once we got into a growth mode.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.
James Loree: Good morning.
Nicole DeBlase: So, I just wanted to ask on pricing, how pricing trended through the end of the quarter into April and if you're seeing more promotional activity from peers and whether or not you guys are getting more promotional activity to drive POS in the North America retail channel.
James Loree: In this environment, promotional activity does not make a tremendous amount of sense. So, all the price that you're seeing is pretty much coming from programmatic price, largely from the margin resiliency program because we're not in there implementing across-the-board price increases in a deflationary environment. And so, we're also getting some carryover from pricing that we did from the earlier price increases on the tariff and other related inflation. But no new pricing actions other than maybe more surgical ones that are based on analytics and things like that that are being utilized in the margin resiliency program.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joseph Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hope you are well. And echo everybody else's comments. Great detail on the call today.
James Loree: Thank you.
Joseph Ritchie: Just one question. Just going back to slide 8 and the trend that you're expecting in Q2. So, I think the way to think through this, auto and aero probably already down more than that number for 2Q. And the commentary around Tools & Storage, it is really interesting to hear point of sale is up double digits. If I heard Don's comments correctly, the sell-in already at the 2Q number, with an expectation that it'll remain there unless the point of sale becomes – stays as strong as it is. Is that the right way to think about it?
James Loree: That's pretty much the right way to think about it.
Donald Allan : The sell-in is right in that range of Q2 right now for tools North America.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Robert Wertheimer: Good morning, everyone.
James Loree: Hey, Rob.
Robert Wertheimer: If I could just ask a related question to the last one. I know you've given a tremendous amount of detail both on how you're managing and on the short term. There's disruption in supply chains globally. If there is a call for more sell-in into the home centers, is there a chance that that's just disruptive and, therefore, you miss out on some sales or do you feel like you've had a handle on that?  And then, I just don't know – again, you give more detail than normal, which is very helpful, what's the normal sell-in process? I don't know whether the up doubles and the down is just – there's some seasonality to this, obviously, or whether, all else equal, you'd be expecting much stronger sell-in towards the end of the quarter? Thanks.
James Loree: Yeah. We have a keen appreciation for the opportunity cost of not being prepared for a spike in orders from the home centers, in particular. And I would say supply chain approaches are somewhat different, but the general rhythm would be kind of monthly. We've gone to a weekly rhythm and, in some cases, a daily rhythm, monitoring the ins and the out. And it is a very, very significant opportunity for us. And so, actually, as it turns out, we have – and Don alluded to this, but we have actually programmed the inventory side – our inventory builds, if you will, to deal with the possibility that there could be an increase in sell-in in terms of orders later in the quarter. Normally, there is probably substantially more orders in the second month of the quarter for shipping in the third month. However, it remains to be seen if that's going to occur this time around. But I think it's one of these things that we're just managing on a real time basis and we're in contact with the customers and we're monitoring the sell-out and, at some point, those two things have to kind of equal each other.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Kenneth Zener: Good morning, everybody.
James Loree: Good morning.
Kenneth Zener: The 2Q thoughts – I'm sure you've been working on the weekends here. I think you laid out 2Q pretty clear. For your base case growth rates for the second half, I'm interested, does the second half base case – are you implying 4Q is up there? And I ask relative to your comments around the 40% leverage, A. And then B, how that $375 million split? Does the majority of that fall into 3Q? I guess that's what I'm looking at, your base. Is that 4Q sales up? And is that $375 million savings split equally 3Q or 4Q? Thank you.
Donald Allan: Yeah. The base case assumes – I'll start with the costs. Yes, $375 million which would actually be a significant impact to moderating those decrementals of 40%. And that's how we get ourselves to the low 20s, is we see that impacting the back half of the year.  As far as the revenue performance goes, by the time we get to Q4 in our base case, we're kind of anywhere from flat to slightly down, and that's really where we are. And then, you can do the math for what Q3 would be based on that. We're not assuming growth right now in our base case in the fourth quarter because it is a U shape, but we'll see. There's still a lot to occur going forward and we'll have certainly a lot more color as we get to July for our next earnings call where we are. But we kind of planned a scenario that would be difficult, which is why we went after the billion dollars of cost, but we did it in a way that gave us the flexibility that both Jim and I've described over the last hour or so.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Justin Speer: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just a question on raw materials. I think you said $6 billion of materials input, this slide – roughly 70% of your cost of goods sold are raw materials and inputs. Just trying to understand what percentage decline you're planning in that cost-out this year simply based on the collapse of commodities in your broader plan? And is there anything beyond that deflation that's in that cost savings bucket?  And then, secondly, how should we think about pricing integrity across the business for the year in this type of environment, just looking beyond the near term pricing dynamics?
Donald Allan: Yeah. I think on the commodity front, we have a really nice opportunity to pursue as a result of the much lower global demand and the way that prices of commodities have adjusted in the last month or so. And that opportunity is now. We're really trying to make that happen in the next 30 to 60 days with all our respective suppliers in those categories.  When I think about the billion dollar opportunity and 60% of it is a combination of indirect and commodity deflation, probably good way to think about that is, it's going to be anywhere from two-thirds as indirect to maybe 55% indirect and kind of in that range and the difference will be commodity deflation. That kind of sizes it for you for this year. And then, we'll see how we progress throughout the remainder of the year.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. We'd like to thank everyone for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-29 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker’s fourth quarter and full-year 2019 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning’s call will also be available beginning at 11:00 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Jeff will review our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we’re going to be sticking with one question per caller and as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may or may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It’s therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I’ll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
Jim Loree: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in this morning’s press release, we successfully closed out the year with an in line 4Q performance. Quarterly revenue was up 2% to $3.7 billion, with organic growth of 2% amidst a mixed global macro. Our total company adjusted operating margin rate was 13.6%, up 30 basis points year-over-year, and adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.18, up 3%. Full-year revenues were $14.4 billion, up 3%, with a solid 3% organic growth performance. Our operating margin rate was quite resilient at 13.5%, just 10 basis points under last year, despite absorbing $445 million of external pre-tax headwinds from tariffs, FX and the like, a significant portion of which were not and could not have been anticipated at the beginning of the year. Adjusted EPS for the year was $8.40, a 3% increase versus 2018, a notable accomplishment under the circumstances. And finally, we were thrilled to deliver $1.1 billion of free cash flow for a conversion rate of 113% and a CFROI of 14%. Working Capital turns improved to 9.8 turns, up a whole turn versus prior year. And this strong cash performance helped us support our growing dividend and enabled us to finish up the year with the balance sheet and great shape with a debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 2.0 times, while absorbing $900 million of capital allocation to M&A in 2019. And in this regard, we closed on two previously announced transactions. And during 2019, first, our 20% minority partnership with MTD provides a path to enter the $20 billion-plus outdoor power equipment market with an industry leader in a financially prudent way. Beginning in July 2021, we have an option to purchase the remaining 80% of MTD, with the potential to add approximately $3 billion of revenue at an all-in EBITDA multiple in the range of seven to eight times. This option remains in place for 10 years, giving us maximum flexibility to enter the market in an appropriate time of our choice. We also closed on the acquisition of IES Attachments, a leading provider of off-highway specialized attachments for prime moving equipment, doing business under the Paladin and Pengo brand names. This transaction almost triples the size of our infrastructure business unit, while further diversifying our presence in the industrial markets. The business features high profitability, good growth, and it’s heavily weighted to the aftermarket, which represents approximately 60% of revenues. In addition, today, we announced that we have reached an agreement to acquire Consolidated Aerospace Manufacturing, or CAM, which gives us an exciting platform for growth in the aerospace components and fasteners market. And I’ll provide a bit more color on that in just a moment. Another highlight from 2019 was the progress made by our Security business. 4Q was a significant step forward in the turnaround as we generated our best security organic growth and recollection at 4%. With all major regions and businesses contributing, North America electronic security was up 10%, a very encouraging indication of the power of our new business model. Security also demonstrated its ability to accrete its operating margin rate, which was up 20 basis points for the year. And so we appear to be at an inflection point, with increasing positive momentum in organic growth and a stable operating margin rate poised for accretion in 2020. And as for the future of Security in our portfolio, we look forward to providing you with a midyear update, as promised. However, we are confident in the value we are creating through this transformation, regardless of whether we choose to retain or to monetize the assets at some point. So looking back at 2019, a lot of progress was made against a volatile uncertain backdrop of tariffs and other external headwinds. Despite the $445 million of pressures, we more than help serve with our financial performance. We continue to execute on our growth catalysts, including Flexvolt, Craftsman, e-commerce, DEWALT, Atomic and Xtreme and acquisitions. We continue to enthusiastically embrace the growing importance of ESG and multiple stakeholder capitalism, recognizing the power of purpose-driven performance and the importance of diversity and inclusion to the success of the corporation. Our 60,000 employees, our Board members and the many business partners in our ecosystem gave it their all and we emerged well-positioned to tackle the challenges and opportunities of the 2020s. And I want to personally thank each and every one of them for their contributions. Our performance this year was no small accomplishment and I’m very appreciative. And with that said, I want to move to another developments that we announced today. As indicated in our release, today, we’re sharing plans for a leadership succession in our Tools & Storage business. And after 20 years with the company, Jeff Ansell has made a personal decision to step back from his responsibilities as President of Tools & Storage and take a less intensive role in our organization. And we’re pleased that we are able to share a seamless transition plan today, with Jaime Ramirez as currently Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Tools & Storage, assuming leadership responsibility for the entire unit over the course of the first-half of 2020. Jeff has been an incredible colleague, teammate and leader of Tools & Storage for 15 years now. In fact, over the last two decades, few have contributed more to the growth and success of this company than Jeff. He was integral to the historic Stanley and Black & Decker integration that created enormous growth for the company. And during his tenure, leading tools, that unit grew from a $600 million revenue hand tool business to a $10.1 billion industry leader. His passion for customers, brands, products and innovation is truly remarkable. And even with that track record and all those accomplishments, we were supportive when Jeff approached us about his interest in making this change. We are grateful for as many years of dedication and high-performance, but also completely respect his desire to spend more time on personal and family endeavors. Further, we appreciate his willingness to remain a major contributor to the company’s success in the coming years. So effective July 1, he will transition his current operating responsibilities to Jaime and will assume the leadership of a major and exciting organic growth program, involving the revitalization of the Black & Decker brand. He will continue in this role through the end of 2021, and at that point, will stay on as a strategic advisor to the company through the end of 2023. And as I mentioned, Jaime will assume full leadership of the business by midyear. He’s a 27-year veteran of Stanley Black & Decker, cutting his teeth in the emerging markets, the agility, adaptability and drive to win necessary to succeed in those high-growth volatile markets will serve him well. And in addition to his strong and proven execution skills, Jaime is a champion of innovation, technology and digital transformation with a socially responsible approach. We are confident that he is the right leader to take Tools & Storage into the future and he will bring that transformative focus, along with his passion for the business to the role. And many of you have met Jaime before, and we look forward to you spending more time with him in the months ahead and the years to come. And so on behalf of the Board and our entire management team, I want to extend our heartfelt appreciation to Jeff for all his contributions and the impact in leading our Tools business to become the largest, most innovative and most trusted tools franchise in the world. And now I’ll turn it over to Jeff to make a few remarks.
Jeffery Ansell: Jim, thank you for the kind words. It is a tremendous pride that after more than a quarter of a century in this company and a decade and a half leading the Tools business, I share with you my decision to transition my responsibilities. 15 years ago, I set out to establish our Tool business as the biggest and best in the world. That mission has more than been accomplished. At this point, I want to share more time with my wife and children, as they so willingly shared me all these years. This transition allows me to do just that and at the same time, remain professionally connected to the company that I love through 2023. A great deal has been accomplished in the past 15 years by the Tools & Storage team in Maine. And while I’m in transition, the team that remains has delivered incredible results, including increasing the size and profitability of the Tools business by more than 17 times, making us the world’s largest Tool company, developing over 10,000 new products and growing our flagship brand to their largest sizes in history, including Stanley Black & Decker, Irwin, Lenox, Craftsman and DEWALT. I lead the Tools business in excellent care. The management team is the absolute best in our industry and have known and worked alongside Jaime Ramirez for more than a decade. His long tenure and successful track record in this wonderful company have prepared him well for this role. Our strength in every major geography in the world and our unparalleled stable of brands, combined with our robust pipeline of innovation, as well as pervasive faith in Jim, Don and our entire management team, instill tremendous confidence in me that this organization’s best days are ahead. I will always be indebted to our customers and employees for making all this possible. And with this, I turn the call back to Jim.
Jim Loree: Thank you, Jeff. It’s been a great journey and not over yet. And before I turn it over to Don Allan, I just wanted to cover a little more detail on CAM. Growing and diversifying our industrial business through M&A is a priority for the company and a key element of our strategic capital deployment. Our vision presented at our 2019 Investor Day is to create a $3 billion to $4 billion global industrial platform that is made of highly engineered application-based solutions. We are looking for businesses that have the attributes you see on the left side of this slide, strong engineering capabilities with technology that has industry-leading, customer recognized and trusted brands, and a recurring revenue component or heavily weighted aftermarket element. Additionally, we want businesses that are global and scale, can differentiate through innovation and operate in strong end markets and have the potential for robust growth over the long-term. Consistent with this strategy, we are very excited about today’s announcement of the CAM acquisition. CAM is a leading manufacturer of specialty fasteners & components for the aerospace & defense end market. This acquisition is an ideal bolt-on to our existing Engineered Fastening business and further adds to our industrial portfolio in a new high-growth, high-margin market. The transaction is valued at up to $1.5 billion, with $200 million held back and contingent upon the 737 MAX receiving timely FAA authorization to return to service and Boeing achieving certain production levels. When adjusted for approximately $185 million net present value of expected cash tax benefits, the net transaction value is approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. CAM has LTM revenues of approximately $375 million and attractive profitability characteristics. This business has strong brands, a proven business model, deep customer relationships and an experienced management team, which will create a pathway for profitable growth and value creation. Given the favorable characteristics of the asset, the five – year five cash flow returns are within our 12% to 15% target, and is expected to add $0.30 to $0.40 of EPS accretion by year three. This acquisition of CAM also gives us a platform asset in aerospace to add on future bolt-on acquisitions. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and we’re excited to welcome CAM and its 1,600 employees to the Stanley Black & Decker family as soon as possible and are ready to get work – to get to work on the integration and synergy plan once closed. And as you take a step back to look at what we’ve accomplished in industrial over the past three years, it is notable that the acquisitions of Nelson, IES Attachments and CAM, aligned closely with our strategy and have increased our exposure to new end markets, while diversifying our industrial portfolio beyond automotive OEM. These three high-quality assets in the aggregate represent approximately $1 billion in revenue and $2.6 billion in strategic capital allocation. Each carry strong prospects for revenue and profit growth, as well as compelling cash flow returns and EPS accretion. And now I will turn it over to Don Allan to cover the fourth quarter and our 2020 guidance.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I would also like to express my gratitude to Jeff Ansell and let him know how much I enjoyed working with you for over 20 years. We work together to drive our company forward operationally. I will miss having you in those moments going forward, but I’m so excited for you and the next stage of your SPD journey. Thank you, Jeff, for being an amazing leader through this wonderful transformation of Tools & Storage. Now I’ll take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the fourth quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 1% total revenue growth, with 2% organic growth and a 1 point headwind from currency. Price was modestly positive in the quarter, but slightly below our expectation. As we saw, our promotional mix increase in North America, which partially offset the continued pricing benefits we are receiving across the global business. The operating margin rate for the segment was 16.5%, up 110 basis points versus prior year. The benefits of significant margin resiliency actions taken, volume and price were partially offset by tariff and currency headwinds, as well as unfavorable product mix and plant under absorption related to significant inventory reductions. Total tariff and currency headwinds amounted to approximately $85 million for the entire company, with 95% impacting Tools & Storage. The unfavorable product mix was caused by reduced levels of hand tools, accessories and storage revenue versus the prior year, which of course has higher levels of profitability, combined with the increased promotional activities in the power tools SBU. We took the opportunity within the quarter to begin to normalize our inventory levels following the completion of the Craftsman roll out and other various brand transitions we have been executing across the marketplace. This effort resulted in a very strong cash flow performance, but the lower production volumes created a non-recurring P&L headwind that we were able to overcome. These last two areas of operational pressures, combined with lower-than-expected volumes, emerged during the quarter and drove a negative impact on our segment operating margin. However, we were mostly able to offset that with significant margin resiliency action. On a geographic basis, North America was up 3% organically. U.S. retail continue to see strong momentum with mid single-digit growth in the quarter. The U.S. commercial channel posted low single-digit growth, while the industrial focused product lines and automotive repair channel were both down high single digits. We believe there was some ongoing customer inventory corrections that occurred during the quarter, which constricted our shipment growth in this particular area. This is the second consecutive full quarter we have experienced this negative impact in the channel. North America’s growth continue to be fueled by our brand roll outs, including Craftsman and new product innovations, such as the DEWALT Flexvolt, Atomic and Xtreme. The sell-through continued to be robust across North American retail, with the fourth quarter once again delivering double-digit POS, resulting in a double-digit performance for the full-year as well. It is rewarding to see these growth catalyst generating such a positive response from our end users and delivering such a strong performance once again. Europe delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter, with seven out of the 10 markets growing organically. This performance was led by the UK, France, Central Europe, Greece and Iberia, which more than offset weaker markets in Italy and the Nordics. The team once again leveraged our strong portfolio of new products and commercial actions to produce above market organic growth. Finally, emerging markets declined 3% organically. Weaker market conditions within Latin America more than offset the benefits from price, new product launches, and e-commerce expansion. The Latin American market pressure was most acute in Chile, Mexico and Central America, which in some cases, you are seeing the political environment or social disruption, beginning to impact the business confidence and the underlying GDP. We saw strong performances in Brazil, India and China, which posted mid single-digit growth, while Russia, Turkey and Korea, all posted strong double-digit growth. Now let’s take a look at the Tools & Storage SBUs. Our tools and equipment delivered 6% organic growth, benefiting from strong commercial execution and new product introductions. User response to our new innovations within Flexvolt, Atomic and Xtreme has been very positive and continues to translate into share gains for us and our customers. Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage declined 3%, as new product introductions are more than offset by the aforementioned customer inventory corrections and the shift to more promotional items such as power tools. In addition, the Craftsman comps are getting more difficult, and this will cause a temporary pressure to organic growth for a few quarters. In summary, a strong quarter and incredibly successful year for Tools & Storage, generating mid single-digit organic growth and an OM rate expansion, despite taking out most of the $445 million of externally-driven cost headwinds that came our way in 2019. An incredibly impressive performance by the team, which continues to be resilient and act with agility to position the business for future growth and margin expansion in 2020 and beyond. Turning to Industrial. This segment delivered 9% total revenue growth, which included 13 points of growth from the IES acquisition, partially offset by a 4 point decline in volume. Operating margin rate increased 40 basis points year-over-year to 13.6%, as productivity gains and cost control more than offset the impact from lower volume and externally-driven cost inflation. Our Engineered Fastening revenues were flat organically, as higher system shipments and faster penetration gains were offset by inventory reductions and lower production levels within industrial and automotive customers. Our industrial end markets remain challenge due to ongoing inventory reductions and slowing trends across these particular areas. However, despite underlying automotive production declining for a sixth consecutive quarter, our auto fastener business continue to benefit from penetration gains, outgrowing global production by 410 basis points. The infrastructure business has declined 17% organically, as volumes were impacted by challenging oil and gas pipeline and scrap steel markets. Now let’s turn to Security. I’m pleased to report we delivered 4% organic growth, marking the second consecutive quarter of positive organic growth. North America was up 7% organically, driven by increased installations within commercial electronic security and higher volumes in healthcare and automatic doors, a very impressive performance in North America. Europe hosted 1% organic growth, led by France and Sweden, which were partially offset by continued market weakness in the UK. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate was 11.2%, down 80 basis points versus the prior year, as organic growth and cost containment were more than offset by the impact from the Sargent & Greenleaf divestiture and investments to support organic growth. The investments are significant and we’ll begin to pay dividends in 2020, as the 2019 revenue impact was modest, but building momentum. Without the impact of these two items, Security would have experienced significant margin rate expansion. It was encouraging to see security organic growth accelerate in the fourth quarter and we expect the top line momentum to continue into 2020. The business will look to balance organic growth and OM rate expansion on a consistent basis, as we leverage our targeted investments in commercial electronic security. We feel the business is well-positioned for success, which is low single-digit organic growth with consistent operating margin dollar and rates expansion. Let’s take a look at our free cash flow performance on the next page. As you can see, our free cash flow for the full-year was excellent, as we generated approximately $1.1 billion in 2019, up $312 million year-over-year, and the free cash flow conversion of 113% of our net income. The improvement was due to higher cash from operations, driven by our working capital improvements, as well as modestly lower capital expenditures. As it relates to working capital, we delivered 9.8 working capital turns, up one turn year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, we made the decision in the fourth quarter to reduce inventory levels within our Tools & Storage business, as the heavy lifting from our brand transitions are complete. As we look ahead, we still see opportunities to improve working capital back about 10 turns in the coming years. We are very pleased with this result. As many of you know, we have been very focused on getting our annual free cash flow back above $1 billion. And now that we’ve completed these significant brand transitions, we were able to complete – achieve that objective in 2019. So let’s move to the 2020 guidance on Slide 8. We are expecting an adjusted earnings per share range of $8.80 to $9, up approximately 6% versus prior year at the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $8.05 to $8.35, inclusive of various one-time charges related to restructuring, M&A costs, as well as the Security business transformation and key margin resiliency initiative. As a reminder, this guidance does not include the impact of the CAM acquisition. In addition, we expect the free cash flow conversion will approximate 90% to 100% in 2020. So let’s turn to some of the drivers of core EPS growth, as you see on the left-hand side of the chart. We expect approximately 3% organic growth, which will generate $0.40 to $0.50 of EPS accretion. The actions associated with our cost reduction program announced in October are broadly complete and expected to deliver approximately $0.95 of EPS. These items will be partially offset by $0.60 to $0.70 of carryover tariff and currency headwinds. Finally, below OM, we expect a net $0.25 EPS headwind year-over-year. This includes a tax rate of approximately 18%, which is up 2 points year-over-year and certain benefits experienced in 2019 will not repeat at the same levels in 2020. Additionally, we are seeing about $0.05 from net headwind, which includes share pressure related to previous financing activities, partially offset by favorable interest expense. Just to clarify our tariff assumption. We are assuming the benefit within our guidance from the recently announced trade deal. So this means, list four A is at 7.5% beginning in the middle of February and list one, two, three remain in place at 25% rate. This result – resulted in a net benefit of about $0.10 in our guidance, which includes a reduction in our tariff expectation, as well as lower-than-expected pricing benefits. As it relates to pricing, we have benefits built into the plan across all of our businesses. But since the tariff environment has deescalated from – for the time being, much of the new 2020 pricing, we achieve will be generated by exact executing margin resiliency actions. So let’s turn to margin resiliency. We are now in full execution mode and expect to generate $300 million to $500 million of cumulative benefits from this program over the next three years. As a reminder, the margin resiliency program is generating accelerated productivity by applying technology to our manufacturing and procurement process – processes, as well as our back office. This was developed as a response to the dynamic nature of the external operating environment, which we now view as our new reality. As such, we are leveraging the program as additional contingency to offset any incremental headwinds or market dislocations that may come away throughout the year. Should the external environment stabilize, or in the event we start to see some tailwinds, we will leverage this program as an opportunity to outperform our guidance or reinvest into our businesses. I would now like to review our expectation for the next quarter. We expect first quarter’s earnings to be approximately 14% of the full-year performance, which is about 300 basis points lower than last year. The first factor driving this lower percentage of full-year delivery is that, we expect a little more than half of the $115 million of full-year external headwinds to impact the first quarter. Next, we’ll anticipate organic growth to be relatively flat in the first quarter. We are planning for the global industrial environment to continue to be choppy, and we are facing more difficult times in Tools due to the Craftsman roll out. While we expect Craftsman to still deliver about 2 points of growth within the Tools & Storage segment in 2020, the first quarter discreetly is one of the toughest comparisons for the load-in, which started to intensify in the first quarter of 2019. These two factors represent approximately two-thirds of the reduced first quarter contribution, resulting in a relatively consistent operating margin rate and dollars versus last year. The remaining one-third of the first quarter difference is related to higher-than-expected tax rate and the impact from consolidating MTD’s full winter season. Now, we’re going to turn to the segment outlook on the right-side of the page. Organic growth for the Tools & Storage is expected to be at mid single digits in 2020. There are multiple catalysts supporting growth, including core innovation, benefits from our breakthroughs, such as Flexvolt, Atomic and Xtreme, e-commerce and the continued contribution from the brand transitions with Craftsman, Stanley and Stanley FatMax. Margin rates are expected to be positive year-over-year, as we realized the benefits from volume, our cost actions and productivity, which will more than offset the carryover impact from the external headwinds. In the Industrial segment, we expect a relatively flat to modestly negative organic performance. This outlook reflects the current slow market conditions within the automotive and industrial end markets, as well as the oil and gas pipeline and attachment tool markets. Our expectation is that the front-half will continue to carry similar market pressures as what we saw in the back-half of 2019. Once we get to the second-half, we do see the opportunity for better performance and potentially modest growth as the comp sees. Operating margins in the segment are expected to be positive year-over-year, as productivity and cost actions are partially offset by modest tariffs and currency headwinds. Finally, in the Security segment, we are expecting organic growth to be up low single digits in 2020. With the investments we have made over the past year, the team has positioned the business for a more consistent top line performance. This is expected to translate into improved operating margins year-over-year, as we leverage volume and deliver on our focused initiatives to lower our costs to serve. One last matter as it relates to guidance. With the recent virus outbreak in China, we are anticipating some questions as it relates to our manufacturing footprint. First, our major facilities and suppliers are not located in the affected area. Our largest tools and engineering fastening facilities are located in the broader Shanghai area. We also have plants that are in mainland China adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the plant along the eastern coast. We are staying close to the situation and the team is working through contingencies for manufacturing and for our supply base. With what we know thus far about the one week extended shutdown for Chinese New Year, we feel this is an impact that has contemplated in our guidance. Of course, this is a very dynamic situation and our teams will react and respond as conditions change and we will update you as we know more throughout the quarter. So in summary, for our total company, we expect a 3% organic growth, 5% to 7% adjusted EPS expansion, inclusive of a 2 point tax headwind. A solid result in a balanced view that focuses on delivering margin expansion by realizing the benefits of our cost actions and generating volume leverage to successfully overcome the carryover impact from tariffs and currency. We believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company for success in 2020. The organization is focused on leveraging organic growth catalyst, executing margin resiliencing – resiliency, generating strong free cash flow and successfully integrating the CAM and IES acquisitions. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim to close out with a summary of our prepared remarks.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Don. One last look at 2019. It was a successful year considering the environment. The performance was possible due to the agility, passion and dedication of our workforce and I thank our people for their commitment. It’s their extraordinary dedication, passion, teamwork and sheer will to win that makes this company so special. Our teams acted with speed and determination, while facing into $445 million currency commodity and tariff headwinds, as well as very dynamic end markets. We delivered 3% total revenue growth, including 3% organic growth, and our OM rate remains strong at 13.5% and adjusted EPS expanded by 3%. In a really positive note, free cash flow was $1.1 billion, with very strong conversion and a CFROI consistent with our long-term financial objectives. And as we turned to 2020, our leadership team will act with agility, leveraging our proven ever-evolving operating system to successfully navigate the underlying external environment. And additionally, we’re continuing to execute on our margin resiliency initiative $300 million to $500 million over several years to get our margins back on an upward trajectory, despite whatever headwinds might appear on the horizon. We’re looking forward to another successful year in 2020, continuing to achieve our vision to deliver strong financial performance, become known as one of the world’s great innovative companies and elevate our commitment to corporate social responsibility. We are ready for the 2020s, and now we are ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Brett Linzey: Hi, good morning. This is Brett Linzey in for Jeff. Hey, just want to come back to the incremental revenue opportunity. I think, you said 2 points contribution from Craftsman. But if we include some of the other key programs, Flexvolt, Atomic, Xtreme with Craftsman, what are you contemplating in the guide in terms of incremental growth from those programs? Thanks.
Jim Loree: Yes. I would say that, the 2 points from Craftsman, obviously, I stated in my prepared remarks, we expect mid single-digit performance for the overall business on a global basis. You’ll have – the other share gains that we will achieve above market GDP, which is probably in the high ones, if you look at our global mix anywhere from 1.8% to 2%. And so, any other share gains that we gain along there will add to that, and then we do have some pressures, as I mentioned, in emerging markets that we expect to continue in the first-half and then some of the industrial tool channels as well. In the first-half, there will be a bit of a drag on that, but those are the main categories. So I would expect share gains, some of those innovations, Craftsman, market growth of close to 2 and then you’re going to have some drag in the areas that I mentioned that kind of gets you to that mid single-digit number.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jason Makishi: Hi. This is Jason Makishi on for Julian. Just a question around the first quarter guidance, particularly around the margin rate. I think last year, there was about a $40 million to $50 million inventory charge taken as a result of commodity cycles and the Tools business. Is there a reason why despite that, theoretically being a non-repeat in Q1 2020, the operating margin rate is going to stay sort of flat year-on-year? Can we get a little bit more color as to what the offsets are? And then maybe just any guidance around what the total commodity headwinds plus tailwind is for the full-year?
Jim Loree: Yes. So the first quarter, I mean, as I mentioned in my comments, we do have an incremental tariff and currency headwind of the annual number is about $115 million, that’s about – half of that’s going to hit in the first quarter. So that’s clearly of the magnitude of very similar to the number you mentioned related to the item in the first quarter of 2018. So, that’s a significant drag that we’re seeing. So you had a one-time now that last year that goes away, but then you had this particular issue that comes in. The – if you look at the split for the full-year, I said under $115 million of headwinds, the tariff numbers, $80 million to $90 million, and then the rest is currency. Commodities, at this point, we expect to be neutral. But, of course, that’s an opportunity as we go throughout the year to see if we get a little bit of deflation as the year goes on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: Yes. Hey, guys. Good morning.
Jim Loree: Good morning
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Tim Wojs: I had a two-part question, if I could. So I guess, the first just the guide for Q1 implies acceleration through the year in Tools and some more meaningful margin improvement through the year. So I guess, what’s your line of sight to both of those within the Tools segment? And then the other side of this is just Jim, you talked about Black & Decker revitalization. I was hoping you could give us just a little color on what exactly that means?
Jim Loree: Don, you take the first part. Yes. So we really respect and appreciate you so much. We’re actually going to take your two-part question, even though it’s really two questions. Don?
Donald Allan: I think it’s very cool how you addressed that, Tim, two-part question, it’s actually one question. Yes, so the cadence for Tools is that, we expect, in the first quarter, kind of relatively flat, maybe down slightly for organic growth, but I feel like it’ll be close to relatively flat. And then as we go throughout the year, there’s this comp issue that we’re dealing within the – in the first quarter for Craftsman is quite significant. It’s almost 3 points in the quarter. And so when you factor that in and you factor in some of the slower markets, I mentioned in emerging markets and industrial, it’s kind of how you get to that number. That’s going to start to regulate in Q2, and it obviously going to get to the back-half. You don’t have those types of pressures you’re dealing with year-over-year. And we expect nice growth from the program of Craftsman for the full-year, as I mentioned, 2 points. And I will remind everybody, the POS continues to be very strong for Craftsman. And it’s double digits – that has been double digits throughout 2019, and we expect to continue to be strong as we go through 2020 and the success of this roll out will help us drive that type of performance. And then we expect some of these markets to get a little better in the back-half and that’s probably the right way to think about the cadence.
Jim Loree: And on the revitalization of the Black & Decker brand, this is an opportunity that has been in front of us for a long time and it’s taken a lot of thought and preparation and we’ve had so many other priorities in revitalizing brands that it was a little bit lower on the list. But it truly is a remarkable brand, one of the great consumer brands in the world. And it’s an opportunity to unlock some great value from this asset. And Jeff, as you know, is the mastermind behind the Craftsman revitalization and execution of that, and now he tackles this Black & Decker project and he’s actually worked and done a fair amount of work on this already, has a fair amount of definition for what it is. But how much of that he and we want to share right now is not very much, because there’s always the element of confidentiality and to some extent, surprise when it comes to these sort of things. And – but I will turn it over to Jeff and you can tell him then whatever you’d like to disclose at this point in time with recognizing that, it won’t be too much.
Jeffery Ansell: So well, to add on to what Jim said, I guess, the genesis of this was that, Black & Decker in any survey, any study you do is like iconic, remains iconic from an aided and unaided awareness perspective. And we looked at the progress across our tremendous stable of brands these past 10 years, and I’ll give you a rough ranges. But we had growth like 70% in the Stanley brand, 9% and 10% with Lenox and Irwin, since we acquired it, over 250% in DEWALT and 500% in Craftsman. we love those numbers. We’re really excited. It’s fueled that growth. Black & Decker is also at the biggest – the largest size in history, but it’s only been up about 3% in that timeframe. So we look at it as a really opportunity cost. We could do so much with that brand. We haven’t had the time to do it. I now have the opportunity to do just that, and we’re excited about what can happen in the next few years here. So you can see, we’re not disclosing a whole lot right now other than it’s a big opportunity. But more to come on that, you’ll see it over the coming quarters should have some impact by next year and really material impact beyond that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Nicole DeBlase: My question is around free cash conversion. If you guys could talk a little bit about the differences between the low and the high-end of the guidance for 2020. And I guess, what’s the scope to get to a 100%-plus conversion sustainably from here?
Donald Allan: Sure. Yes, I would say that for 2020, that range of 10% of 90% to 100% is really dependent on probably primarily two factors. One would be working capital. We did end the year at close to 10 turns. And so we will continue to drive improvement in that number. But to get a positive impact in your free cash flow related to working capital, you need at least a half to 0.07 [ph] of a turn improvement for the whole company to make that happen. So we might get close to that, but it might actually be closer to neutral than a positive impact from working. And then CapEx will be something that continues to be between 3% to 3.5% of our revenue. But we also know that it’ll probably at the higher-end of that range in 2020, as we start to work through some of these China supply chain mitigation strategies as we move production to other countries in certain cases, as well as we will be building our Craftsman plant in Fort Worth, Texas as well, and there’ll be a fair amount of costs in 2020 related to that. So those are really the two factors that kind of result in that variation. Our goal is clearly to get to a 100% or more and always is, but we occasionally on an annual basis will manage that to achieve these other strategic objectives.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Jim Loree: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Rehaut: First question, I guess first and only question I have is on – just kind of parsing out the 2020 guidance a little bit more. Specifically, just wanted to revisit the margin resiliency initiatives, you referred to it in the prepared remarks is something that you expect to continue to materialize. And just wanted to get a sense of how you’re thinking about that flowing through and the timing of that benefit flowing through in 2020, if you’re still thinking about the $100 million to $150 million type of benefit for the year and how it would hit the P&L? And then just as a slight clarification, the $200 million cost reduction, I’m coming to that being about $1.05 in EPS benefit, I just didn’t know if my math is off, if there was something different between that and the $0.95?
Donald Allan: Yes. The last part of your question is really just kind of timing of that particular – as we know certain things, certain parts of the world, you can’t do it as quickly as you’d like. So you have a little bit of an impact to that. That’s why it’s about $0.10 different than what you’re calculating for your math. But that obviously will carryover into 2021. Our margin resiliency, I’m glad you asked that question. The – if you remember from the October earnings call, when we gave you some initial thoughts about 2020, we were really had the objective of trying to position the company with an EPS growth that was reasonable, given the headwinds that we were going to experience or as a carryover into 2020. And I think we’ve done that with the guidance today at 6% midpoint. But we also wanted the margin resiliency to get about $100 million to $150 million of value in 2020, but we wanted that to be more of a contingency. And I mentioned that in my comments earlier, and that’s really the plan. So it’s not baked into our guidance right now. It’s there for, if other headwinds come our way that we have to deal with, like this virus and China as example might be a little bit of a headwind for a period of time. Currency might be a headwind that emerges or it doesn’t emerge, these headwinds don’t happen. And there’s an opportunity for us to outperform, and as I mentioned, reinvest in the business. The cadence by quarter is relatively consistent. It’s not going to be backend loaded in a big way. So, I would expect you can be pretty close to evenly split, maybe 40% in the first-half, 60% in the back-half.
Jim Loree: And if I could just add. When we look – we look at the environment that we’re in over the last three years, the external headwinds have averaged about $300 million a year. And if you look at the five years preceding the 2017 to 2019, which is – would be the last three years, we look at the previous five years, they averaged $135 million a year. So we had a step function change in headwinds and most of those headwinds at the beginning of the year are a significant proportion of them were – it was impossible to plan for them. And so I think we’re sitting here at this juncture with the potential that we could have headwinds of hundreds of millions of dollars like we had over the past few years. And obviously, we have some of that in the plan or not, or something less. And so, it’s only prudent to reserve a pretty significant contingency for the potential that we could have really, really significant headwind similar to we’ve had over the last three years. And so that’s kind of where we’re thinking about it. And if they don’t come, then we have a fantastic opportunity to outperform our earnings, as well as reinvest in the company – in the company’s growth.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Deepa Raghavan: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Deepa Raghavan: Okay. Question is on capital deployment. It’s a good start, especially purchasing some different exposure with CAM. But, Don, what – how should we think about deployment pace, the pace of deployment going forward, given the $1.5 billion cash deal takes up much of the excess cash availability over the year, even as you’re deleveraging. Any thoughts there? And thank you.
Jim Loree: I’m going to tackle that question, because Don has had so many questions about guidance, so I want to give him a break. But also, we both think about capital deployment quite a bit and we happen to agree on our approach. And so, as most of you know, our long-term capital deployment strategy is to allocate 50% of our excess capital to M&A and 50% to giving back to the shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. And over the last 20 years, you will find – if you calculate that, you will find that it actually turns out to be 50%, 50-50. And so we’ve been true to that and we will continue to be true to that, because we think that for this company, that is the best value creation strategy for the long-term. And so, we shouldn’t look at these things necessarily in isolation. But from a tactical point of view, we were at 2.0 debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year. This will take us up to 2.66 for a period of time until we work it down again. So, there won’t be a lot of M&A activity – of significant M&A activity this year, unless something really significant comes along. And then we we look at what are the options and going forward, we have the Security business, which is a potential asset to monetize, if something really down the fairway came along our way. We also have the MTD option in front of us, but we have 10 years to execute that. So there’s no pressing need to have a – probably about $2 billion of – when we finally implement or execute that option, it would be about $2 billion if we did it in the 2021, 2022 timeframe. So I think, we’re in a great position from a tactical point of view, too. We have the opportunity to create excess capital if we see something really great that we want to execute on in terms of M&A. We also have the opportunity to kind of take 2020 as sort of rebuild the balance sheet year back to where we want it to be for the dry powder and we’ll go from there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Justin Speer: Thanks, guys. Just wanted to just follow-up on the comments on the promotional cadence and channel inventories, you mentioned them being full for at least a portion of the Tools & Storage business. You mentioned promotions being a little bit more elevated in parts of the Power Tool business. Just wanted to get a sense for what’s going on there? And thinking about the incremental tariffs, incremental pricing if these elements are going to make it really difficult to get incremental pricing to at least partially offset the the carryover tariffs and currency?
Donald Allan: Yes. So, I’ll take that. The promotional activity, I would kind of summarize that as it’s an intense holiday season. There were a lot of things going on in the power tool space. And we ran probably higher-level promotions than originally expected as we went into the quarter, which that can happen sometimes in a holiday season, like the fourth quarter, even the second quarter occasionally, as we go into the – late spring and summer. So I would just say that’s things that happen and nothing really unusual about that. I would also say that, we did have a little bit of a reduction in the inventory and the channels by our customers, and so not a massive reduction in weeks on stock, but there was a little bit of a reduction in some of our major customers, which is good, because that’s just them managing their inventories appropriately. And as you know, in the case of one of our customers, in particular, they build a higher level of inventory due to those significant launch of Craftsman and that’s going to have to continue to be something we monitor. But we’re going to manage that throughout the year as we go through 2020 and still achieve 2 points of growth, as I mentioned, for Craftsman as we manage that dynamic. And if the POS continues to be strong, the way it has been in double digits, that the amount that we have to manage in inventory will become smaller and smaller. As far as tariffs go, the $85 million carry over, a lot of that is tariffs that were put in place in the back-half with some pricing put in place in that period as well. So there’s a little bit of carryover price, but we’re going to manage price more through the margin resiliency initiative versus specific pricing actions for tariffs, so there’ll be a little bit of that associated with $A, but that’s not a large number.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ross Gilardi: Hey, good morning.
Jim Loree: Hey, good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Ross Gilardi: I was just wondering, can you give a little more details on CAM, like how profitable is the business? When did the transaction actually closed and sort of why is the equation so far out? I realize these are series of same questions, but a number of questions, but just really some more color on CAM aftermarket versus OE and Boeing exposure and whatnot?
Jim Loree: Sure. I mean, we’re not disclosing the actual profitability level at the request of the CAM folks. However, suffice it to say that, it’s a high-growth, high-margin business and the – have substantial EBITDA and EBITDA growth potential ahead of it. The aftermarket is a pretty significant part of the revenue base. It has grown approximately 6% organically over the long-term. So very nice asset, high-growth, high profitability, good aftermarket content, and a lot of engineering content, which in a lot of these components are in critical functions on the airplane. So we’re very happy to have made this acquisition. It’s a strategic platform. There are multiple multitude of bolt-on opportunities, as well as some larger opportunities that may or may not become available over time. So it just gives us a great runway for future growth.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We’d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-24 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be the operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, later we will conduct the question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third Quarter 2019 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself is Jim Loree President and CEO, Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO, and Jeff Ansell Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11:00 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim. Don and Jeff will review our third quarter 2019 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking to just one question per caller and as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call, such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
Jim Loree: Okay. Thanks, Dennis, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's release, we delivered a strong third quarter successfully overcoming $90 million of currency and tariff related pressures as well as weak end markets conditions in some industrial and emerging markets. Fortunately, the US construction in DIY markets continue to be supportive. With the help of our growth catalyst we once again achieved above market organic revenue growth and at the same time protected our earnings base. Revenues were $3.6 billion, up 4% with organic growth of 4% and acquisitions, adding three points. That solid organic and inorganic growth was partially offset by a 2% decline from currency and a point from divestitures. Tools and storage achieved strong 5% organic growth with craftsman, new product introductions and e-commerce contributing. North American retail POS continued at strong double-digit levels with the second week of October, marking the 22nd consecutive week in double-digit territory. Industrial total revenues grew 13% with a 16.0 contribution from the IES attachments acquisition. The IES integration and targeted cost synergies remain on track, segment organic volume was down modestly 2% as global light vehicle production continues to be in deep contraction and general industrial markets are on a slowing trend across the globe. Currency also shaved a point off the Industrial revenue line. Security made progress on its value creation plan reaching an important milestone in 3Q with the generation of positive organic growth. Our investment in digital talent, the rapid commercialization of new technology-based solutions and our activities in the small and medium business segment are starting to gain momentum. Electronic security achieved mid-teens order rates during the quarter and is now working to convert a strong backlog into future revenue. We are confident that there is a significant value creation opportunity on the horizon as we execute this transformation. In this regard, we reiterate our commitment to update investors on our security portfolio review, no later than the first half of 2020. For the overall company, we delivered 2%, adjusted EPS expansion and a consistent operating margin rate versus prior year. 2% EPS expansion are seemingly modest accomplishment but impressive when taken in the context of $90 million of external headwinds. It was our pricing, cost control and margin resiliency actions that enabled us to overcome an escalating tariff regime, persistent dollar strength and the unfavorable impact of which grew by $15 million as the quarter proceeded. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and the year 2020, our view now assumes a continuation of the current demand environment across our markets, as well as some carryover tariff and currency related headwinds into 2020. We continue to swiftly respond to the volatile external environment with price recovery, supply chain adjustments and acceleration of our margin resiliency initiative. It's a testament to the strength of our team in our enterprise that we have produced above market organic growth and a 9% CAGAR, EPS expansion over the past three years, while simultaneously absorbing $900 million and commodity tariff and currency related cost inflation. To preserve our ability to deliver continued earnings and cash flow growth in 2020 and beyond, we are taking new cost reduction measures that will result in approximately $200 million of annualized savings. This is in addition to the previously announced margin resiliency actions which will also contribute materially to 2020. When taken in combination with our robust growth pipeline, these cost/margin actions position us for a solid 2020 setup for EPS and cash flow. So with that and with our balance sheet in great shape after deleveraging this year, we are ready to tackle whatever market conditions come our way in 2020 and beyond. Here are some specifics, which will continue to drive growth as we look ahead. The craftsman brand roll out continues to be a fantastic story by the end of the year, we will have grown craftsman into a $600 million business, net of cannibalization just three years following the acquisition that is $500 million of pure organic growth. The craftsman program includes several top tier retail partners and by year-end 2020 we will have over 10,000 retail outlets with $1 billion of revenue by 2021, six years ahead of our original plans. It's also clear that our innovation machine is stronger than ever. FlexVolt is now nearing $400 million in annual revenue and continues its double-digit growth trajectory. Our latest breakthrough innovations DEWALT Atomic and Xtreme power tools offer the highest power to weight ratio is available in the market, this time in the compact and subcompact segments. These two product lines are quickly adding hundreds of millions of dollars of growth and the positive end user reception demonstrates that these products are going to be winners in the marketplace. E-commerce is also a powerful growth driver in our emerging markets and developed markets. We are the industry leader by a wide margin with $1 billion in global revenue growing consistently at double-digit levels and then there are the revenue synergies from our recent acquisitions. We're well on our way to broaden our distribution of the Irwin and Lenox brands around the world and by next year we expect to generate a cumulative $100 to $150 million in revenue synergies. Additionally, we are exploiting the revenue potential from the IES attachments and Nelson Fastener's acquisitions. And then finally with our MTD partnership, our teams are now working together on multiple opportunities to generate operational efficiency and revenue growth. With this relationship we've gain entry into the $20 billion lawn and garden market in a financially prudent way and beginning in July 2021 we have the option to purchase the remaining 80% of the business with the potential to add approximately $3 billion of revenue at an all-in EBITDA multiple in the range of 7 to 8 times. These programs position us for a strong multi-year revenue growth and share gain outlook. However, we are not singularly focused on growth. To support margin expansion and create a buffer for future external volatility, we're making progress with our margin resiliency program. This is a major transformational initiative, which will provide $300 million to $500 million of cumulative operating margin benefit by 2022. Most of the benefit derives from systematically applying digital technologies such as AI, machine learning, advanced analytics, robotics, and connected factors among others to create value across our entire enterprise. So as you can see, there is a lot to be excited about as we look ahead, as we make cost structure adjustments in the near term, we continue to feed the commercial and innovation machine that has created this powerful growth story. So, thank you and now, I'll turn it over to Don Allan who will walk you through more detail on segment performance, overall financial results and guidance. Don?
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the third quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 4% revenue growth with a strong 5% organic growth, offset by one point currency. Volume growth contributed four points and price delivered one point of growth. The operating margin rate was 16.6% flat versus the third quarter of 2018 as benefits of volume leverage, pricing and cost control for offset by the impacts from currency and tariffs, which totaled approximately $90 million of the entire company. However, 95% of that impact was in Tools & Storage. Share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU . Looking at the geographies, North America was up 7% organically. US retail has strong momentum and delivered low double-digit growth in the quarter. The US commercial channels posted low single-digit growth while the industrial tools & Storage business was down mid-single digits due to the ongoing customer inventory corrections we've been experiencing . And then the automotive repair channel had growth of low single digits. The strong quarter in North America was fueled by our growth catalyst, namely the craftsman brand roll out and an ongoing stream of Nucor and breakthrough innovations such as DeWalt, FlexVolt, Atomic and Xtreme. The shipments were supported by continued strong sell-through, as evidenced by the double-digit POS growth in North American retail. The growth catalysts have been a steady source of outperformance, which has helped us to navigate slower growth and in the industrial and emerging markets. Now moving on to Europe. Europe delivered 4% organic growth in the quarter. This was led by the UK, the Nordics, Central Europe, Greece and Iberia more than offsetting some softer markets including Germany and France. Overall, the team continues to gain share leveraging new product innovations and commercial actions to produce above market organic growth. This will be the sixth year in a row that our European team has demonstrated mid-single or high-digit organic growth. A truly outstanding performance by that team. Finally, emerging markets declined 1%, the ongoing benefits from price, new product launches and e-commerce expansion were more than offset by market contractions in Mexico, Turkey and China. We continue to see share gains across the region with Brazil, Chile, India, Taiwan and Korea posting mid to high single-digit growth. And then Russia, delivering double-digit growth in the quarter. The emerging markets team continues to contend with currency volatility and is delivering pricing actions to protect our margins and leveraging our growth catalyst to deliver share gains. Now looking at the tools and storage SBUs, power tools and equipment delivered 6% organic growth benefiting from commercial execution and new product introductions. We are benefiting from the strong craftsman performance as well as expanding our leading DEWALT power tool system with new innovations. Our trio breakthrough innovations FlexVolt, Atomic and Xtreme deliver on key user needs for more power with smaller formats. They clearly are generating share gains for us and our customers. Moving to a hand tools, accessories and storage, we delivered 5% organic growth driven by new product introductions and the ongoing craftsman rollout. Our national big box partner is now fully set across all locations with the successful launch of 1200 new craftsman products. The broader rollout for our e-commerce, and other retail partners is well underway. Sell through remains strong and we continue to convert new users, which will represent significant share gain opportunities as we head into 2020. So in summary, another excellent quarter for Tools & Storage, this team continues to act with agility to react to the changes in the external environment while positioning the business for future growth and margin expansion. Looking at the Industrial segment, the segment delivered 30% total revenue growth with the IES attachments acquisition contributing 16 points, partially offset by a volume decline of 2% and a 1.0 headwind from currency. Operating margin rate declined year-over-year to 15% as productivity gains and cost control were more than offset by the impact from lower engineered fastening volume and the externally driven cost inflation we experienced. Engineered fastening organic revenues were down 4% as fastener share gains were offset by inventory reductions and lower production levels within the automotive and industrial customers. The market environment for this business remains challenged with underlying automotive production declining for the fifth consecutive quarter and our industrial markets are showing signs of inventory reductions and slowing trends. Despite this though our auto fastener business showed positive organic growth in the quarter demonstrating 300 basis points of content penetration gains relative to the underlying market. The systems business within automotive which is capex driven as we know showed low double-digit decline and despite gaining share the industrial fasteners business was down in the mid-single digits. The infrastructure business delivered 4% organic growth due to stronger onshore pipeline project and inspection activity in oil and gas. This is partially offset by lower hydraulic tools volumes, which was impacted by a difficult scrap steel market. And then finally, as Jim mentioned the IES business and the related integration continues to hit all key expectations. So as we turn to Security this segment delivered organic growth of 1% in the third quarter. North America was up 3% organically driven by higher volumes within healthcare, automatic doors and electronic security. Europe was down 1% organically, a strong growth in France was offset by continued adverse market conditions in the Nordics and the UK. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate was 10.9%, down 20 basis points versus the prior year as organic growth and cost containment were offset by a 50 basis point impact from the Sargent & Greenleaf divestiture as well as investments to support the business transformation and commercial electronic security . The modest growth achieved in the quarter was another encouraging step as a security team begins delivering on the targeted investments we've made in digital, commercial talent and field technicians. These talent investments support the commercialization of new technology enabled solutions focused on delivering customer insights through data analytics and in app-based solution for our small to medium enterprise customers. The forward-looking indicators remain positive as we continue to see mid-teens year-over-year improvements in orders and backlog. We are optimistic the team can continue to build upon their early wins to deliver consistent organic growth going forward. So now let's turn to guidance, looking at page 7, we are revising our 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance to 835 up to 845 from our previous range of 850 to 870. This new EPS guidance represents an increase of approximately 3% versus prior year at the midpoint while overcoming close to $450 million in external headwinds from commodity inflation, currency and tariffs. On a GAAP basis, we expect an earnings per share range of 650 to 660 compared to our prior range of 750 to 770. In addition to the items impacting Core guidance the changes primarily attributed to an additional 150 million of restructuring charges associated with the cost reduction program announced today. Now let's dive into a little more detail in our 2019 adjusted EPS outlook. You can see on the left hand side of the chart. We estimate an incremental 55 million in external headwinds related to tariffs and foreign exchange since providing guidance in late July. This additional impact is evenly split between currency and tariffs. The tariff related headwind now includes the estimated impacts from list for China tariffs at 15%. Additionally, we are modestly reducing our expectation for organic growth, which reflects a slower growth environment, we have been experiences when in our industrial channels and emerging markets. Our plan now calls for an above market 3.5% to 4% organic growth as we continue to leverage our strong pipeline of organic growth catalysts and a choppy market growth environment. Partially offsetting these headwinds are incremental benefits from the margin resiliency initiatives, incremental cost actions and a lower tax rate, which is now expected to approximate 16.5%. Moving to free cash flow guidance as we look at the third quarter, free cash flow was $96 million which brings our year-to-date performance to a use of cash of $21 million which is 266 million better than the prior year. The year-to-date improvement versus 2018 is primarily related to higher net income, lower capex and reduced levels of working capital. We remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for the year, utilizing our core SFS processes and principles combined with reducing working capital levels in line with normal seasonal activity. Therefore, we are reiterating our commitment to deliver a free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 85% to 90%. So if we turn to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, we'll start with tools and storage with assumptions call for mid-single digit organic growth and a relatively flat to positive margin rate year-over-year. The team will continue to leverage price cost actions margin resiliency and of course volume to offset the external headwinds and deliver operating profit growth. We expect the fourth quarter to demonstrate margin rate expansion as we continue to take additional actions to offset the incremental impacts from currencies and tariffs. In the Industrial segment, we continue to expect a low single digit organic decline reflecting the slower market growth, we've been experiencing across our general industrial and automotive end markets. Total growth is expected to be positive, including the contributions from our acquisitions. Operating margins are expected to be down year-over-year driven by lower volume and their share of the impact from these external headwinds. And then finally in our Security segment, we expect positive organic growth and operating margin rate and dollar expansion year-over-year as the team remains focused on realizing the benefits from our transformation strategy. So as you start to think about the set up for 2020, I would like to provide you some insights. As Jim indicated earlier, we are taking cost actions to help counteract the carryover effect of currency and likely tariff headwinds, as well as softness in the industrial and emerging markets. The actions to adjust our cost base have commenced. And we are implementing a cost reduction program expected to deliver $200 million in annual cost savings. The cost savings will come from head count actions across the company as well as executing some footprint rationalization opportunities. As we approach this cost reduction we were focused on ensuring our commercial and innovation organizations have ample resources to continue growing above market and look toward areas where we can rationalize leadership structures or organizations to serve the businesses more efficiently. In some cases this accelerating existing organizational efficiency and plant footprint rationalization plans capture within the margin resiliency program. However, even with these cost actions announced today, we firmly believe we can achieve additional margin resiliency benefits in 2020 to ensure we are prepared for any potential new headwinds. This $200 million cost reduction program is a proactive response, which will allow our businesses to demonstrate a solid level of margin growth in 2020. So we don't want the likely carryover headwinds presumed previously mentioned an expected higher tax rate next year of approximately three points, we feel we have positioned the company for continued adjusted EPS and free cash flow growth next year. So in summary, for the whole company we expect 3.5% to 4% organic growth for 2019, low single-digit EPS expansion which is overcoming $445 million of commodity, currency and tariff related headwinds. These headwinds equates almost $2.50 of earnings per share. The organization remains focused on executing our playbook to generate above market growth, optimize our global supply chain, adjust our cost structure through the actions announced today and generate significant value with our margin resiliency program, which will ensure the business remains well positioned to deliver sustained above market organic growth and earnings expansion in 2020 and beyond. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff to provide some additional color on tools & Storage, Jeff?
Jeff Ansell: Well, thank you, Don. Our Global Tools & Storage delivered strong performance in Q3 led by strength across North American retail in Europe, we've just completed the rollout of our impressive craftsman range across hardware, wholesale, home center and e-commerce channels. The tremendous growth and share gain we are experiencing with craftsman is accretive to our growth, which is accretive to the market. The end-user reviewed an endorsement of our more than 2,500 craftsman products is unprecedented. We have extraordinarily high confidence in our ability to deliver 1 billion by 2021. We also see the opportunity to expand across industrial and automotive channels into the future. Our DEWALT business continues to be robust, delivering double-digit growth led by strength across our flexible franchise as we continue to advance across commercial applications as well as outdoor solutions. New product launches across DEWALT, Atomic and Extreme ranges in 20 volt and 12 volt applications respectively offer the user best in world power to weight performance and has been immediately endorsed by users across the globe. Finally, our expansion of Stanley and Stanley FatMax will exceed 100 products this year and continues to serve as a share gain enabler consistent with our ambitious expectations. In summary, tremendous new product development across craftsman, DEWALT and Stanley has enabled growth and share gain throughout 2019 along with momentum carrying into 2020. Now I will turn it back to Jim to wrap today's presentation.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Jeff and great product story. In summary for the company, we delivered a solid 3Q with 4% organic growth, $2.13 earnings per share overcoming $90 million in currency and tariff headwinds. This continues to require execution of price optimization, cost control and margin resiliency in response to the external cost pressures, which for 2019 are now $125 million higher than our January guidance. Nonetheless, we will deliver in 2019 a respectable financial performance with 3.5% to 4% organic growth and year-over-year EPS expansion. As we close out the year we remain focused on day-to-day execution and operational excellence. This includes continuing to leverage our organic growth catalysts realizing the initial benefits from our margin resiliency program successfully integrating our recent acquisitions and generating strong free cash flow, our proactive $200 million cost reduction program announced today will supplement these activities, providing us with the capability to perform and whatever environment we encounter in 2020. Dennis , we are now ready for Q&A.
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. As always, I just wanted to kind of dig into the $20 million cost reduction program, a bit deeper than we maybe expected and I know you've been so dancing around this your preserving growth investments and making sure you don't harm growth potential, but equally wanted to reduce cost as well. I'm just wondering what this tells us about how you view the world in 2020, how you preserving the growth investments and maybe addressing the any overlap between the margin resiliency program and what you're forecasting for 2020?
Jim Loree: Okay. It's Jim. I'll tackle this one Nigel. I have done comment on the overlap, as it relates to the numbers. First of all, the size of the program is a compromise between what the art of the possible and how much growth we want, or how much cost, we wanted to take out like any cost reduction program and we were fortunate for a couple of reasons. Number one, we've had a few structural ideas percolating for a while here that have enabled us to combine a few organizations and drive more enterprise efficiencies. So in areas, for instance like emerging markets and the Global Tools & Storage business [indiscernible] we segregated them about six years ago in order for us to focus more on the emerging markets provide more focused effort on the emerging markets, especially in the growth area. Now a couple of things have happened. First of all, the emerging markets have become more volatile and there's less growth in the near term there and so we have also established an infrastructure in the emerging markets, which is really solid now and the focus has produced that and so now we can combine that with the other assets of the Global Tools & Storage business leveraging those assets across the entire globe. So I think that's a, that's a big one. The other one is in the industrial segment we ran those three different enterprises separately and now we're going to run them on a combined basis. So those two structural changes have created a pretty significant opportunity for cost reduction. And then there's just several functions that we are taking a more enterprise approach too, so for instance, just pick one communications and also marketing. Those two are now being done on a much more of an enterprise basis and that has resulted in pretty significant cost reduction. So those are a couple of the elements. Another one is that for a long time we haven't really looked at spans and layers across the organization and we had been doing that in connection with the margin resiliency initiative and as it turned out, there were a couple of pockets in the organization where we had grown more layers and the spans were lower than optimal. And so we've been able to take action in those areas and I think that's a very positive change because it creates agility, even more agility for the organization. So. with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about how much of the margin resiliency is overlap and how much of the 300 to 500 is consumed by the 200.
Don Allan: Yes. So we expected that many of you folks would have this question. And when you think about some of the things that Jim was describing, several of them are actually new concepts that we had within the organizational efficiency pillar of margin resiliency. So if you think about the $200 million, I think probably the simplest way to think about it, it is probably about a third of $60 million to $70 million is really things that we pulled forward that we were contemplating as part of margin resiliency. And then the remainder of it is really just looking across the entire enterprise and for areas of efficiency, plant rationalization decisions, etcetera. So the way I step back from it and look at this is the $300 million to $500 million as Jim reviewed earlier in the presentation as we think about that going forward into 2020 and beyond. I still feel very confident that we can achieve the $300 million to $500 million above and beyond what we're talking about even with maybe 60 million to 70 million of that being consumed because I just think the opportunity is very significant and we've dedicated a full-time team of people we're putting one of our senior leaders in charge of it, full-time, starting at the beginning of January. Steve Roderick who presented at the Investor Day on the topic. And so we are dedicating resources in the sense of people, resources in the sense of technology investments, and then we also brought in certain consulting resources on a minimal basis as well to ensure that we hit this objective over the next three to four years . But my confidence level actually goes up as each month goes by, given the amount of effort and focus we have on in the opportunity that we see.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: I guess maybe just thinking about Craftsman $600 million kind of ending the year and the target for $1 billion in 2021, I guess, how should we think about the phasing of that incremental $400 million over the next couple of years and then you know what's the opportunity if the crossing is beyond the $1 billion as you look out even further beyond '21?
Don Allan: Yes, I will take the question. It's planned at this point. So as Jim indicated, we've added $500 million of organic growth since acquiring the craftsman brands putting us at about $600 million this year, we have high level of confidence that we can grow that to about $800 million by the close of next year to a $1 billion to close the following year to put us very much on track to the billion dollars objective we set. And we still have opportunity beyond that, from new product development and category expansion within the existing base, but then also as I intimated earlier, opportunities for that craftsman brand in the industrial and automotive space, which is placed that it had a kind of builders reputation over the last 90 years. So we have very high confidence on that attainment plan of $200 million of over a year for the next two years to reach $1 billion and growth beyond that clearly so, high level of confidence and endorsement of the craftsman growth plan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Deepa Raghavan: Good morning, Jim And Don. I have a margin question, I apologize it has a couple of parts to it, but I guess I could use some clarity. First, how the 2/3 of the $200 million in new cost action different from the margin resiliency measures, i.e. do those do those costs come back once the environment improves, that's one part of it. The second part is, can you talk about your updated thoughts on that $300 million to $500 million in cost actions, is that range so sufficient given weakening backdrop or a kind of majority of those cost actions that are saved be pulled forward well before 2022 if macros weaken further here or should we think about that, as you know, there is a gestation period or staggering period to these cost actions and they just cannot be pulled forward before 2022? Thanks.
Jim Loree: Yes, I will. As I mentioned, in response to Nigel's question, of the $200 million. Yes, about a third of it, we basically what we've done is we've, we've accelerated some margin resiliency initiatives and Jim gave some good examples of what those were when he responded to a portion of that question, such as emerging markets and core tools coming back together, combining our three industrial businesses and running them as one platform, et cetera. So those were pulled forward as an acceleration. But what I also said was that I felt confident even with that pull forward that we still can achieve $300 million to $500 million of margin resiliency starting next year and beyond in addition to that and so we don't feel like we've done anything here that significantly changes our view on that $300 million to $500 million and that will commence in a significant way starting next year, as a way for us to build contingency against new potential headwinds. And I've said publicly before that we think that's about $100 million , $150 million per year, starting next year and then we'll have a subsequent a few years after that to achieve the number that I just or the range that I've just described. I think that's the best way to think about it. We have not done anything to minimize the potential impact of that $300 million to $500 million, which means if you add those two things together, we think the opportunity is a little bit bigger now.'
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just a clarification around if we think about the overall external headwinds into next year. Was that the 150 million or is that at the slightly different numbers you see it today versus the full five this year and when we're thinking about the total scale of the cost reduction plans, the stuff in May and what you've announced today are those scaled with a view to still being able to hit maybe the low end of the medium-term EPS growth guidance that had laid out back in May, or is that very much still a question and we'll revisit when you guide formally for next year?
Jeff Ansell: Yes. So as it relates to the headwinds as we go into next year, if you just look at what the headwinds that are in place today, which would be list one through three and then list four A, the carryover effect of that is about $100 million and then if the second list for it happens in December, which is list four B, which would be the remainder of items that come from China, they have not, do not have a tariff on it today that would be another $25 million of carryover impact, so the total of those two would $125 million assuming that second list four happens. FX carryover right now looks to be about $30 million to $40 million of an impact next year so in total, we're somewhere in the 155 to 165 carryover impact of all those items. It does not, that does not encompass if there is an increase to any of the tariffs going like there was things being discussed of going from 25% to 30%, if that occurred on list one through three that would be another $55 million so you're getting to a number of around 210 to 215 roughly at that point in time. And so we think we've taken enough actions at this stage related to the $200 million to offset what is known but we've also put a little bit of cushioning there for the likely or possible increase in some of these tariffs as we think about that going into 2020. On the second part of the question , I think at this stage, we feel like we position ourselves to grow our EPS and as we close out in the fourth quarter and we give guidance in January, we'll give more specifics and details but with these headwinds I just described and a tax headwind year-over-year as I mentioned in the presentation, we still see a path to demonstrate as Jim said solid EPS growth.
Jim Loree: I would also note that this is a little bit different than in the past, because in the past we've historically, last couple of years anyway we've averaged about 40% price recovery on these tariffs. What we've done here is we've covered the entirety of the tariffs with cost actions and the question would be, what's the market outlook next year, is it going to trend negatively or is it not. So what we're really trying to do with margin resiliency plus also covering 100% of the of the tariff exposure with cost actions is to make sure that we have a very significant cushion in the event that the economy takes a turn for the worse, we're not predicting that, we don't see it. We see it in industrial and we see it in some of the emerging markets and so on, but we don't see it in the core of our business, which is the North American retail and with Europe, we see a little slower, but still not terribly negative on the construction in DIY side. So I think it's a very prudent way to go into the year. I think we're set up really nicely and we'll see where we go from here
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks, good morning everyone. First question I just wanted to get appreciate all the detail. And I guess just a couple of the remaining pieces of the puzzle, at least, people are trying to do some of the math around 2020, you hit on the carryover from tariffs, the difference there as in FX. I was just curious, at this point in time, if you had a sense about raw materials and we've had other companies starting to talk about it being a slight tailwind next year, how 2019 is shaping up from a raw material standpoint and if we just froze today in time how that might flow into 2020 and also on the margin, I'm sorry, on the cost-cutting initiatives the cost reduction initiatives into the $200 million, should we be expecting that to fully be realized in 2020 or maybe even partially be realized in the fourth quarter and the bulk remaining in 2020 just a sense of timing on that ?
Don Allan: Yes, sure. So as it relates to commodity inflation as we sent back in the July earnings call, we expected a little bit of moderation of that in the fourth quarter of this year, we're still expecting that is still baked into our guidance assumption as it was in July, not a significant number, but we are seeing a little bit of positive trend there. We're still trying to finalize expectations for next year related to commodity inflation, but at this stage trends are good in certain areas, other areas are not as positive. But overall, we think we still would see some level of deflation probably modest deflation at this stage, but we still have a lot of work to do over the next two to three months, to really nail that down, because we also do see it as an opportunity as we go into 2020 to see if we can achieve some deflation in that particular area, which is just another area that allows us to build contingency, as we think about some of the any new headwinds or as Jim mentioned, the more difficult to market that might evolve. At the end, the second part of the question, which was related to what Dennis, what was the second part -- much cost savings have been in the next, low cost savings. Yes, the vast majority of the $200 million is next year. It's a very small impact here in the fourth quarter. And so I would factor in the $200 million hitting in 2020.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks, good morning guys. Can I just get a, just a clarification on the tariff so the impact to this year it doesn't seem like it's really changed much from what you guys said intra-quarter, but then if I look at the List 1 to 3 tariff that were supposed to increase on October 15 that seemed to have gotten delayed and so is that, is the increase embedded in your 4Q guide or is the delay embedded in your 4Q guides, just some clarification around that would be helpful?
Dennis Lange: Well, the increase that happened in the third quarter is embedded in our guide related to List 4A, the change from not going to 30%, which was kind of the relief that was given a few weeks ago where List 1 through 3 was going to go from 25% to 30% that is not factored into our guidance.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning guys. Just on the cost saving side. Don. Is there anything else besides the initiatives you guys have announced today that blends into next year. Obviously there's a lot going on in 2019 that you've been working on all year but any carryover from that?
Don Allan: From the cost actions, specifically I guess you're referring to other cost actions we've done Josh is probably [indiscernible]. So I assume that's where you're talking about other cost actions that we've taken throughout the year. Yes, there's a little bit of carryover effect related to some of the margin resiliency initiatives we've done, but I wouldn't say that's anything significant. It's probably in the $10 to $15 million range. It's not something very significant.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks, good morning guys. So I guess maybe just one clarification on restructurings, of the 200 million savings. Just thinking about how the cadence spreads over 2020 since some of this is like plant rationalization, which to me seems to take a little bit longer than the more basic headcount reduction stuff and then one question that isn't around tariffs so restructuring you guys still have conviction in Tools & Storage margins returning to positive territory in 4Q. If you could talk about like the drivers of that conviction since we just haven't seen that play out. So far year-to-date.?
Don Allan: Yes. So and if you start with your first question, I would say that the cadence by quarter next year, but it's $200 million benefits will be pretty even. About $50 million per quarter because of the vast majority, a large part of that will be completed by the end of we're going into the beginning of the first quarter. There will be some planned things that are a little bit delayed, but frankly, the magnitude of that is not going to change that cadence dramatically. As far as the Tools margin rates. I mean actually we had a great second quarter where our margin rate was up 80 basis points versus the prior year, the third quarter was flat versus the prior year and now we expect the fourth quarter to be up, as I mentioned and so, actually we did turn the corner on that in the second quarter, the first quarter was down significantly, because that was really the biggest quarter of headwinds, just looking at an individual quarter for this year but that trend has changed in the second quarter in a big way. We saw some new headwinds emerge in the third quarter that didn't allow us to grow the rate, but it was flat year-over-year and then the fourth quarter we will able to grow as because now we're able to take some, some more actions in response to the new headwinds that allow us to do that and then you combine it with the fact that the rate was pretty low last year given the 4th quarter would was say with some pretty significant headwinds as they started in the third, fourth quarter of last year as they went into the first quarter.
Jeff Ansell: Yes, my remarks, I mentioned that from our January guidance through presence. We've had $125 million of evolving growing headwinds during the year. I think for us to drive that margin story and most of those were in Tools. So for us to be able to perform at that margin rates that we have under the circumstances I think there has been a fairly impressive story in the face of pretty significant adversity.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Justin Speer: Thank you, guys, I appreciate your time. Just a couple of questions rolled up and one is just where in the P&L will these initiatives, the $200 million initiative show both on the consolidated basis, but also the segment basis. And you had I think a $250 million of cost cuts last year, another $200 million that rolled into this year and another $200 million next year and then you also talk about the $300 million to $500 million, I'd like to kind of maybe parse out where that falls, where you think that's going to shine in the margin structure. And then lastly if tariffs are removed, how do you think your margins respond in that scenario and a good case scenario that we find resolution? Thank you.
Don Allan: Yes, I would say that the cost actions are across the entire company every business has participated the corporate functions that participated. So the impact of them will be spread across all those different categories based on the magnitude of spend, so you can probably easily do the math, given the level of SG&A that we have in each business and at corporate and just kind of apply that percentage against the total SG&A for the company and that's pretty much what it's going to do for next year, as we think about the $300 million to $500 million going forward that again will benefit every business, I mean I think the magnitude from a dollar perspective will be larger in Tools & Storage just because it's a much bigger business and the opportunities around NextGen procurement industry and those types of things will definitely hit that business in a bigger way. And so at the end of the day, there could be a little bit more heavy weighting to Tools given that some of those things are really more specific to our Tools business in the manufacturing footprint that they have or the procurement processes and organization they have, but now I don't think it's a dramatic shift. I think you can look at that and probably recognize that every piece of the company is going to feel the benefits of that over the next three to four years, and I want to answer the best part of your question which is, what if they go away. While the reality is we don't expect them to go away and -- that's you love to talk about . I don't often get is an opportunity to discuss so really enjoy it, but the total tariff impact I think built in at this point is $425 million annualized and as I mentioned earlier, we've been recovering there's through price about 40% of historically anyway of the tariff impact. So I think the really good news is, if the tariffs are removed, yes, the customers are going to want some money back and we probably want to give it back at least some of it, because the price elasticity of the end products and end markets but in reality there's a pretty significant chunk of tariff impact headwind that would not be given back or at least we have the flexibility to do what we want with it, and frankly, it would be nice to see that drop through to the margin line. So, yes, thank you for the questions. In the fourth just to clarify, the 425 would assume all of this four happens and List 1 to 3 gets another 5% on it, so that we're going to be that the scenario that I laid out, were all these things went in a negative way it would be 425 on an annualized basis; based on what we know today, the number would be 345.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Ken Zener: Good morning, everybody. I understand your actions are attempting to address all of the inflation through your own actions not through the market pricing. I'm wondering could you, obviously it's a more conservative approach, but what does it, tell us perhaps about consumer elasticity or the retailers' willingness so far to accept more price increases and/or how your competitors are getting impacted as these tariffs impact product that's fully assembled. Thank you.
Don Allan: Yes, I mean obviously we can't get into a detailed discussion of competitive dynamics we have our General Counsel is sitting at the end of the table here looking at us, but we would never do that; however, I will say that that 40% that we've recovered, we were unfairly, in my opinion, hit with tariffs on componentry for products that we made in the United States, which is pretty significant for us relative to competition and up until List 4 our competitors were not feeling that same impact. So we were in a position for a while until List 4 came about, that we were competitively disadvantaged now with List 4, it changes the playing field and at least levels that you could even argue, it's somewhat in our favor now, so I think what happened over time was that the competitors did some pricing actions, probably not to the extent that we did. And so it's interesting when you look at the volume performance of Stanley Black & Decker vis-a-vis the competitors were doing pretty well. So I haven't studied economics since college but I would say that we have, I think through our value propositions in some of the products that Jeff Ansell talked about whether it's Craftsman, whether it's Xtreme, FlexVolt, Atomic or Stanley FatMax. I mean, I think all of these product actions in addition to a lot of our commercial excellence activities and our scale and our global reach, et cetera, have enabled us to gain share and to avoid the elasticity trap of some of the, what we otherwise would have experience. So it's a real testament to the strength of our value proposition and our commercial execution that we've been able to put numbers on the board in organic growth at the level we have been.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from [indiscernible]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning and thank you. It's -- just on the faster side, obviously the entire industrial economy has a little bit of excess inventory probably trade war-related. Is that sort of excess inventory correction done in next year, you get a chance to ride up and down with the markets or is there a little bit more and then relatedly I don't suppose there is excess inventory in the big box channel but just a sort of checking on that question if that's any kind of a risk? Thanks.
Don Allan: Let me take the industrial piece now then will hand over to Jeff on the big box side. So on the industrial side. I wouldn't call it excess inventory. I would call it a combination of the manufacturing markets are slowing. And so, you're seeing a little bit of an impact of that and then you're just seeing what I would call more normal inventory corrections that occur at this stage of a slowdown and so we've seen a slowdown start in the second quarter and continue to the third quarter, likely will continue for at least a portion of the fourth quarter. And so what we're just seeing is our customers really just focused on tightening their inventory levels, but I wouldn't have described it as excess inventory before. Jeff?
Jeff Ansell: Regarding the second part of the question, the POS that Jim and Don had referenced, it has been incredibly positive all year and accelerated over the last 22 weeks, but it's the, the double digit POS that we have achieved year-to-date and continues as we speak, has been in balance with inventory, so we don't see any excess inventory and aggregate across the home center channel and POS continues to be a really robust story for us across all the brands we've referenced. So all in all things are already getting really well and share gain continues to be in our favor.
Operator: Thank you, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-23 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today’s call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker’s second quarter 2019 conference call. On the call in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools and Storage. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning’s call will also be available beginning at 11:00 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim Don and Jeff will review our second quarter 2019 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with other calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It’s therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. It’s my understanding that the webcast may have some issues with the advancing of slides and so as such we will be identifying which slide that we are speaking to as we move through the presentation today. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Dennis and good morning to our guests. Thank you for joining us. Stanley Black & Decker delivered a strong outperformance in the second quarter to close out the first half of 2019 in a solid position. We continued to generate above market organic growth, achieved operating margin rate expansion and delivered adjusted EPS growth overcoming a $110 million of pre-tax currency commodity and tariff headwinds. This 2Q outperformance is a testament to the agility and determination of our 61,000 employees around the globe. Their continued efforts to drive growth, realized price and control cost enabled us to successfully overcome the external forces that have pressured our margins in recent quarters. With their help, the company produced its first quarter of operating margin rate accretion since the fourth quarter 2017, a critical milestone. On that positive note, second quarter revenues were $3.8 billion, up 3% versus prior year. This included 3% organic growth and 3% from acquisitions which was partially offset by a 3 point currency headwind. Price materialized as expected contributing 2 points of revenue growth in the quarter. The growth was achieved despite some challenges in specific markets this quarter, such as continued declines in global automotive light vehicle production and a deceleration in other industrial focused end markets. Emerging market conditions were also generally weaker than normal in several markets around the world. Tools & Storage achieved a strong 5% organic growth rate with most regions and business units contributing. The tools business continues to benefit from a powerful set of catalysts, including the ongoing Craftsman rollout. We also benefited from continued focus on product innovation and commercial execution. And as a result, the team continued to build on its record of consistently delivering market share gains. Industrial, total revenues grew 13%, enabled by the IES Attachments acquisition. In its first full quarter of results, the business is demonstrating pro forma organic growth with solid operating margins and the financial performance remains on track. Assimilation of employees, suppliers and customers is well underway and going smoothly and all-in-all, we are pleased with how the integration is progressing. Security continues to demonstrate progress on its value creation plan with improvements in both operating margin dollar and rate versus prior year. The margin improvements delivered to-date are encouraging and we believe there is more to come. We are now seeking to leverage our talent investments in our commercial initiatives to generate organic growth. The recent infusion of over 1,000 digitally proficient associates has upgraded the security talent base and enabled the rapid commercialization of technology centered customer solutions. We expect to see continued progress on all fronts in the coming quarters for security and as you can appreciate, there is significant value creation potential associated with a successful transformation. Moving to the overall company, I am pleased with our strong operational performance, which was punctuated by 60 basis points of operating margin rate expansion and 4% adjusted EPS growth versus prior year. This was achieved with a laser focus on cost control and price execution with our business teams overcoming in the quarter, approximately $110 million of mostly 2018 carryover headwinds. With a solid first half behind us we are reiterating our full year adjusted EPS range of $8.50 to $8.70. This includes a 4% organic growth, margin rate expansion and 4% to 7% adjusted EPS growth versus prior year while absorbing an estimated $390 million in combined tariff currency cost inflation, OM pressures, again mostly from 2018 carryover. The power of our growth catalyst is clear. We continue to deliver above market organic growth even as some markets around the world have slowed. These share gains have resulted from execution of our SFS 2.0 operating system and include an array of programs, including the Craftsman brand rollout, breakthrough innovations such as DEWALT FLEXVOLT, Atomic and Xtreme as well as from acquisition revenue synergies, emerging markets and e-commerce. To ensure that we create an even more resilient, adaptable and agile organization, we recently launched a major companywide program that we call margin resiliency. As mentioned in our May Investor Day, this program will deliver $300 million to $500 million of annualized operating margin benefit over a multiyear period. The effort is centered around creating benefits across our entire value chain by applying the latest digital technologies and techniques such as artificial intelligence, advanced analytics and others to optimize performance and create incremental margin. Specific areas of benefit include supply chain automation and optimization including Industry 4.0, price realization, indirect cost reduction and organizational efficiency. Our ability to execute a program of this nature as forward facing and impactful as it is was made possible by our aggressive investments in recent years in digital transformation. Our purposeful commitment to high performance, innovation and social responsibility has enabled us to attract and inspire the talent capable of doing this. Margin resiliency will have impact as early as the second half of 2019 and the momentum will build in 2020 and beyond. And finally, as a separate but also positive note, I would like to highlight that last week we increased our dividend for the 52nd consecutive year. The quarterly payout now stands at $0.69 per share, which represents a 5% increase. This is a reflection of our confidence in our cash generation capability and our capital allocation strategy of returning approximately 50% of our excess capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases and 50% towards M&A over the long-term. And with that, I will now hand it over to Don Allan for a more detailed discussion on second quarter results and 2019 guidance. Don?
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the second quarter. For those following on, I am on Slide 5 within the presentation. Tools & Storage revenue was up 2% as 5% organic growth was offset by 3 points of currency pressure. Volume growth contributed 3 points while price was aligned with our expectations and added another 2 points of growth. The tools team continues to do an excellent job balancing price realization and margin recovery with above-market organic growth and share gains. The operating margin rate for the segment was 17%, expanding 80 basis points from the prior year as the benefits of volume leverage, pricing, and cost control more than offset the impacts of currency, commodity inflation and tariffs. Returning to margin expansion was an important milestone within tools and it was realized in the second quarter while offsetting significant external headwinds. As Jim mentioned, the company had $110 million of tariff, commodity and currency headwinds to more than offset in the quarter. The Tools & Storage business was impacted by greater than 90% of these headwinds. The strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across most Tools & Storage regions and SBUs. Looking at it on a geographic basis, North America led the way and was up 7% organically. This performance was driven by share gains in our U.S. retail and commercial channels, up high-single digits and mid single-digits respectively. This was partially offset by a modest decline in the industrial focused businesses. The overall North American results were robust considering that we saw some of our construction and industrial focused customers modestly bearing inventory during the quarter. North America’s growth was fueled by the Craftsman brand rollout, price realization and new product innovations. Clearly, these growth catalysts are resonating with the end user and delivering share gains as evidenced by double-digit POS experienced in the second quarter. Moving on to Europe, Europe delivered 5% organic growth. 8 out of 10 markets grew organically with double-digit performances in Central Europe and Iberia and solid mid single-digit performances in Germany, the UK and the Nordics. The team continues to gain share leveraging our strong portfolio of brands, new product innovation and commercial actions to produce above market growth. And then finally in emerging markets, emerging markets declined 2%. The ongoing benefits from price, new products and e-commerce expansion were more than offset by a 3 point impact from market contraction in Argentina, Mexico and Turkey. Despite the pressures from these three markets, we continue to see broad-based share gains across the region. Brazil, Colombia and Taiwan posted mid to high single-digit growth, while Russia, Korea and India all posted robust double-digit performances. The emerging markets team is focused on delivering pricing benefits to recover currency headwinds and leveraging our growth catalyst to deliver share gains in what we expect to be a continued slower growth market environment in the back half of the year. Now, looking at the Tools & Storage SBUs, both lines had a solid contribution to the overall performance. Power tools and equipment delivered 6% organic growth benefiting from strong commercial execution and new product introductions. In particular, the outdoor segment posted high-teens growth driven by new products and expanded merchandising launched under Craftsman, DEWALT and DEWALT FLEXVOLT brands. Jeff will provide more detail about this later in the call. Additionally, we will begin shipping our newest – we began shipping our newest breakthrough innovations, Atomic and Xtreme which have a superior power to weight ratio compared to other products currently on the market. Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage delivered 4% organic growth as new product introductions and the ongoing Craftsman rollout continued to contribute to growth. So in summary another excellent quarter for the tools and storage organization as they continue to leverage our growth catalyst to deliver above market organic growth and share gain. Equally as important they returned to margin expansion, overcoming significant external headwinds through growth, cost control and disciplined price execution. Now turning to industrial, this segment delivered 13% revenue growth, which included 18 points from the IES Attachments acquisition, which was partially offset by a 3% organic decline and a negative 2 points from currency. Operating margin rate was down modestly year-over-year to 16.4% as productivity gains and cost control were more than offset by the impact from lower Engineered Fastening volume and commodity inflation. Engineered Fastening organic revenues were down 4% due to declines in automotive light vehicle production, lower system shipments and softer general industrial end-markets, which were partially offset by fastener penetration gains. We continue to see declines in underlying global automotive production for the fourth consecutive quarter, which has been down approximately 5% during the first half of 2019. The infrastructure businesses delivered 2% organic growth, primarily driven by stronger onshore pipeline project and inspection activity in oil and gas. The growth was partially offset by lower hydraulic demolition tool volumes whose underlying market is negatively impacted once scrap steel pricing declines. And then finally the Security segment declined 3% with bolt-on acquisitions contributing a positive 2 points and price delivering a positive 1 point. This was more than offset by volume being down 2%, unfavorable currency of 3 points, and then a negative 1 point impact from the Sargent & Greenleaf divestiture. North America security was flat as higher volumes within healthcare were offset by lower automatic door installations. The strong order and backlog trends in this region continue to demonstrate growth is around the corner. Europe was down 2% organically. France was again a bright spot for the region as the team leverages commercial actions in the small to medium enterprise market that is associated with our overall transformation plan. This growth however was more than offset by adverse market conditions in Sweden and the UK. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin expanded a significant 120 basis points in the quarter to 11.2%. Once again, the security team demonstrated progress with its business transformation. For the third consecutive quarter, they successfully delivered margin rate and dollar expansion through controlling costs and delivering operational efficiencies in our service and monitoring organizations. To take the next step, security needs to demonstrate consistent organic growth in the back half of 2019. We are encouraged by the value creation potential from our commercial investments. Year-to-date, we have filled over 100 new sales positions and added over 40 technicians in the United States and Europe. We are bringing in digitally enabled skill sets to develop new solutions that utilize the information flowing through our analytics platform to deliver insights to help our customers improve their operational efficiency. We have also begun commercializing new app based solutions for our small to medium-sized customers. While this is not yet manifested itself into significant organic growth, we have seen strong order patterns and backlog improvements, which make us optimistic that growth is on the horizon. Now, let’s move to Slide 6 and briefly look at the quarter’s free cash flow performance on the next page. For the second quarter, free cash flow was $404 million, which brings our year-to-date performance to a use of cash of $117 million. The quarterly and year-to-date improvements versus the prior year are predominantly explained by higher net income, lower CapEx and a significant improvement in working capital. We remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for the year utilizing our core SFS processes and principles, combined with reducing working capital levels in line with normal seasonality activity. Therefore, we are reiterating our commitment to deliver a free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 85% to 90%. Now, let’s turn to earnings guidance on the next page, Slide 7. We are reiterating our 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance, which calls for approximately 4% organic growth and an adjusted earnings per share range of $8.50, up to $8.70, up approximately 6% at the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, the EPS range remains unchanged at $7.50 to $7.70 per share. Now, diving into a little more detail on our 2019 adjusted EPS outlook, you can see on the left hand side of the chart, we estimate an incremental $50 million in external headwinds primarily related to List 3 China tariffs, which is in essence increasing from 10% to 25%. This increase will be partially offset by slightly lower second half expectations, related to commodity inflation. Additionally, we are modestly adjusting our full year expectations around organic volume growth, which reflects a slower market outlook for general industrial and emerging markets and incorporates the deceleration we saw during the second quarter. Our plan still calls for solid 4% organic growth as we execute our robust pipeline of growth catalysts, which will deliver above market share gains. Offsetting these headwinds are incremental pricing actions, the initial benefits from margin resiliency and the operational outperformance achieved during the second quarter. Finally, we expect third quarter earnings per share to approximate 23% of the full year performance, while the fourth quarter earnings per share will approximate 29% of the full year earnings. These quarters are slightly different than historical trends due to the timing of various brand transitions on revenue, impact to pricing in response to tariffs and the margin resiliency benefits. In addition, we will have some variation in the effective tax rate for each quarter. Now, turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, Tools & Storage assumption still calls for mid single-digit organic growth and margin rate expansion year-over-year. As demonstrated with the second quarter performance, the team will continue to leverage price cost actions, the margin resiliency initiatives and volume to offset the external headwinds and deliver operating profit growth. The second half of the year should see a continuation of margin expansion, as we anniversary the carryover headwinds from 2018 and take actions to neutralize the incremental List 3 tariffs. Moving to the Industrial segment, we are now expecting low single digit organic decline reflecting the slower market outlook across our general industrial and automotive end markets. Total growth is expected to be positive, including the contributions from our acquisitions. Engineered Fastening organic growth is expected to decline low single digits, but the second half performance should see a slight improvement sequentially versus the first half, as the year-over-year comparables will begin to ease. Operating margins are expected to be down year-over-year, driven by lower volume and the impact from the external headwinds. The Industrial teams are focused on controlling costs and capitalizing on share gain opportunities that often present themselves during a difficult market backdrop. We fully expect the business to emerge in a stronger position, when the automotive market once again turned positive. Finally in the Security segment, we are expecting positive organic growth in operating margin dollar and rate expansion year-over-year, as the team continues to execute on its transformation strategy. So in summary, for the whole company, we expect 4% organic growth for the full year, 4% to 7% adjusted EPS expansion, which is overcoming close to $400 million of commodity, currency and tariff headwinds. We continue to be encouraged by the collective efforts across the organization through the first half of the year. This strong operational performance puts us in a position to deliver our 2019 EPS guidance, while incorporating incremental tariff headwinds and navigating dynamic end markets. We are very pleased to achieve operating margin rate expansion in the second quarter and believe this will continue for the remainder of 2019. We remain focused on leveraging our continued above market organic growth, pricing and cost actions. Additionally, we will begin to see the savings associated with the margin resiliency program in the second half. These factors combined will result in operating margin growth and rate expansion for the full year of 2019. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Jeff to provide some additional color on the Tools & Storage business. Jeff?
Jeff Ansell: Thank you, Don. In Tools & Storage, we maintained our Q1 momentum led by another strong performance in North America and Europe. Our continued focus on innovation-led growth and the ongoing execution of brand initiatives were key drivers to this success and share gain. Notably, our innovations in cordless and corded outdoor products across DEWALT, Craftsman and Black & Decker have enabled a fantastic outdoor season, where we are up mid-teens organically year-to-date. In Craftsman Outdoor, we launched a broad range of cordless products for the season with a 60 volt system catering to outdoor enthusiasts and 20 volt range designed for residential use. In DEWALT, we also launched new 60 volt outdoor products, which are part of our flexible battery platform. They are delivering growth in addition to our 20 volt outdoor line. We are seeing strong POS across the portfolio, as DEWALT outdoor continues to gain traction in the market. More broadly, our DEWALT 20 volt line is the largest professional cordless system in history, with over 250 products augmented by the recent launch of DEWALT Atomic series, which is the best-in-class power to weight ratio product. We are also pleased with the launch of our 12-volt DEWALT Xtreme series, a range of performance packed, offering power tool and organic solutions for variety of applications. With this program just beginning to ship, we expect to see incremental growth in the pro-power tool space in the back half of the year. Our DEWALT cordless battery platform continues to expand on serving a broad spectrum of end users from heavy-duty applications with large power requirements via FlexVolt to compact applications in the mechanical, electrical and plumbing and pro-user segments via our DEWALT Xtreme and Atomic range. This broad category innovation has been accelerated by tremendous brand execution across DEWALT Stanley, Stanley FatMax, Irwin and Craftsman, all of which are positive year-to-date. Lastly, a word on Craftsman, overall performance and customer rollouts remain on track and we continue to be well on our way to delivering three points of incremental growth in 2019 and our $1 billion target by 2021. The most satisfying part of the Craftsman re-launch has been our redesigned products are winning with the end user in delivering growth and share gain for us and our customers. Now, I’ll turn it back over to Jim to wrap today’s presentation.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Jeff. Great quarter. So to recap, we had strong operational performance in the second quarter, serving us well in this dynamic external operating environment. Partially due to the outperformance based on margin rate accretion, we’re able to reaffirm our full year guidance today, despite somewhat slower end markets especially in industrial automotive. And as we look to close out a successful 2019, we are focused on day-to-day execution and operational excellence in accordance with our SFS 2.0 operating system. This includes continuing to leverage our organic growth catalysts, building momentum and realizing early benefits from the margin resiliency program, successfully integrating our recent acquisitions and generating strong free cash flow. I’m confident that our seasoned management team will bring the same level of passion, intensity and agility that we demonstrated in the first half to successfully deliver the second half of 2019, well at the same time, preparing for a strong 2020 and beyond. Dennis, we are now ready for Q&A.
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.
Jim Loree: Hi Julian.
Julian Mitchell: Hi. Maybe just my question would be around the phasing of the gross external headwinds and what that means for operating margins in the second half. So I think your guidance implies about $120 million of gross external headwinds left for the second half, maybe help us understand how much of that falls in the third quarter. And just following up on the commentary on margin expansion for the rest of the year, that I think you’d said, are you saying the Q3 margins will be up year-on-year as well or it was just a general, second half comment?
Jim Loree: Okay. So you’re correct with the $120 million in the back half of the headwinds. That’s an accurate calculation. And then, the third quarter – the split would be roughly $75 million to $80 million in the third quarter and the remainder in the fourth quarter. So a bigger amount hitting in the third quarter as things like commodity continue to tail-off, etc, and then we obviously have new headwinds in both quarters from tariffs. So that would be the split that we’re seeing. And we do expect margin expansion both in the third and the fourth quarter. However, the third quarter will be probably a modest expansion in the 20 bps to 40 bps range, and then we’ll see a larger expansion in the fourth quarter as a lot of the actions that we’re taking in response to the new tariffs, such as pricing will get a full effect in the fourth quarter and then some of the margin resiliency things we’ve been working on, that will – that will grow across the back half of the year and we’ll see a larger impact in the fourth quarter, hence why we see bigger expansion in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Nigel Coe: Hey. Maybe just – Jim, you talked about deceleration through the quarter. Maybe just talk about how June trended you guys. You didn’t mentioned weather, so congrats on that, but I’m sure weather was a factor. And maybe just touch on the inventory headwinds that you saw at the big box channels. And I’ll leave it there. Thanks guys. 
Jim Loree: Yes. We don’t want to get too much into the month by month data, but suffice it to say that we didn’t really see a significant slowing in the construction DIY-type markets. The slowing was predominantly in the industrial, general industrial and specifically automotive sectors of our business. So our DIY construction and those types of tools held up very well. I mean, we’ve got POS as strong as I’ve ever seen in 20 years. So if the market is slowing, it’s not slowing for us not in that – in that part of the business. And a lot of the inventory corrections we saw were in the industrial channel, and we saw other corrections that were modest in different parts of the Company, that’s just normal course activity though.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning everyone.
Jim Loree: Mike, good morning.
Michael Rehaut: First question I had was on the – the core organic growth, you know, the tools business continues to perform very well, just wanted to understand, given some of the comments around industrial which might not as much impact the Tools segment more perhaps the other segments, but your comments around some slowing of end markets, emerging markets, etcetera. How do you expect the back half to play out on an organic growth standpoint, 3Q versus 4Q? And then just lastly if I could sneak a clarifying question as well. Don, you mentioned the tax rate impacting 3Q, 4Q results. A little more detail there, if possible? Thanks.
Don Allan: Sure. So, the organic tools and storage performance as we mentioned in Q2 was 5% organic growth, and we had a little bit of negative decline in some of the industrial channels that we serve for industrial tools, about 2% of a decline in those particular businesses. So, nothing significant. We do believe as we look at the back half of the year for Tools that we’re we think the organic growth is somewhere between 5% and 6% for the back half, with the quarters being pretty much in that range for both quarters. So, the trend that we saw in the second quarter feels like the right trend as we go into the back half of the year. And so, we’ve shown a little bit of moderation in the Industrial section of the tools business. On the tax rate, the third quarter tax rate is kind of 25%, 26% and the fourth quarter will be around 15% to 16%.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks. Good morning guys.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Don Allan: Hi, Nicole.
Nicole DeBlase: Hey, there. So just one quick one on the 3Q versus 4Q ramp, I didn’t hear you guys talk about organic growth for the two quarters. I know the comps are a little bit easier in the third quarter, a little harder in the fourth. So just how to think about the 4% for the rest of the year? And then, on just on Tools & Storage, did you guys see the 3-percentage point benefit from Crafts in this quarter, implying that just the underlying market was kind of flattish?
Jim Loree: So, on the third and fourth quarter organic growth, 4% for the year. When you look at the third and fourth quarter split, the third quarter is a little bit below the 4%, fourth quarter is a bit above the 4%. We have to remember in the fourth quarter there is a lot of activities that will be happening around the brand transition in particular. So, we’ll see a positive impact from that. We’ll see some of it in the third quarter as well. But we’ll see a bigger ramp, most likely in the early part of the fourth quarter. So that’s just something to consider as you think about the performance. On the Craftsman side, yeah, we saw a significant impact of about 3 points related to the Craftsman rollout. And so, as you saw from the performance, in North America we had a very strong high-single digit retail performance across many of our key customers and not just related to Craftsman, certainly Craftsman was a significant part of that, but then we saw some negative performances in emerging markets. I mentioned the three countries that were contracting and we saw some positive performances in the European market. So, you know, overall, it’s kind of kind of netted to a relatively small number, but we had some significant pockets of growth as you look at them.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: Hey everybody. Good morning.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Tim Wojs: Maybe just touching on Europe a little bit. You know, I think accelerating organic growth in that region is pretty impressive. So, I’m just thinking you know, as you look over the next 12 months, just the sustainability of a mid single-digit type organic growth number in Europe and the programs that may be supporting that as some color. And then what do you think Europe on an underlying basis in Tool this is actually growing, thanks, the market?
Jeff Ansell: So, I’ll take that. And this is Jeff. We’re quite optimistic for the remainder of the year in Europe. So, if you remember, we had a little more than 2% growth, organic growth in Europe in the first quarter, 5% here in the second, and we feel comfortable with that same type of growth rate in the back half, really driven by share gain. If you look at the results we’re posting, where we’ve been up somewhere between eight of ten and ten of ten in total markets for the last several years and that trend continues. So, the expansion and growth of DEWALT Stanley, brands like FACOM, etcetera in Europe have been extraordinarily positive. So, we feel very good about it and I think our intelligence would tell us that the European tool business has grown well less than half of that is what we think, probably less than 2% and we’re probably going to end the year closer to five. So, we feel good about it. But again, it’s probably more share gain than it is robust end market.
Operator: And our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Justin Speer: Good morning, guys. Thank you.
Jim Loree: Hey, Justin. Good morning.
Justin Speer: Just the SG&A, I know you have the cost reduction program rolling through that $60 million I think per quarter on the $250 million program announced last year. That seems to be phasing well. But as you think about this program and some other programs that you may be unfurling for the balance of the year, SG&A and thinking about in the next year, is this permanent or should we think about some of these costs coming back next year if growth is better next year?
Jim Loree: Yes. I would say that the vast majority of this is permanent change. You know, like any time you do a cost reduction program, you make decisions maybe to freeze merits and some other things that are definitely temporary, but those are modest, when you look at the total impact of $250 million. And so, as we think about margin resiliency initiatives going forward, those will be permitted, kind of process sustainable structural changes in how we do business to make us more efficient and effective in meeting the needs of our customers, and as we work with our vendors and other partners across the business. So, the margin resiliency initiative is really about sustainable permanent change.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning guys.
Jim Loree: Hey, Josh.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Just want to follow-up, Don, on your point on the 3Q versus 4Q phasing and you mentioned that price was part of it. And I know that there is probably a lot of little things that add up to that third quarter versus fourth quarter EPS growth rate, but if I remember last year, you know, the expectation for price in fourth quarter was pretty high, and then ultimately with promo activity and I think seasonally, just having a harder time getting price in the fourth quarter given the holiday, that ends up being kind of a long pie. Is there something different about how you’re expecting to go through that process this year or something that you think has changed in the market from a pricing perspective?
Don Allan: Yes. I would say, a part of what’s happening in the fourth quarter is price, because we get a full quarter impact versus the third quarter, getting a partial impact. But the bigger impact of why our earnings are up or will be up in the fourth quarter is that the dollar volume for revenue is expected to be significantly higher than the third quarter, given that we have various brand transitions that we’ll be executing on. We expect the industrial segment to perform at a higher level, given we had a very difficult fourth quarter last year and as they’re anniversarying some of those headwinds. And then obviously we expect security to demonstrate some growth as well. So, it’s all those different factors. But if you look at a 4.5% roughly organic growth performance in the fourth quarter, you’re going to get to a sequential growth number in revenue that’s close to $250 million to $270 million. And as that flows through to operating margin and eventually earnings, that’s going to be a significant reason for the higher level of performance, combined with all the other little things that you mentioned, like price, margin resiliency, etcetera. The tailing off of commodity inflation that’s going to happen more in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, it’s all those different factors that are going to drive that. I think one of the things that I didn’t mention, but I will mention now is that when you look at the operating margin dollars as a percentage of the full year, the percentage in the third quarter isn’t dramatically different than the percentage in the third quarter of last year. And so, when you look at the OM dollar percentage to the full year by quarter, you look the first quarter was lower by about 2 points to 3 points, versus last year. The fourth quarter is going to be higher by 2 points or 3 points for the reasons I mentioned. But the two quarters in between are pretty much in line with last year’s performance. When you look at that level, you can do the same thing at pre-tax, it’s relatively the same thing. It’s really when you get down EPS that you see a bigger deviation because of the tax rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Deepa Raghavan: Good morning, all.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Deepa Raghavan: Great quarter. Obviously, a lot of moving pieces within your guidance, can you talk through some of the items that positively surprised you in the quarter? It could be with your pricing initiatives, the cost actions, whether it was in markets or regions that surprised you favorably, or what also was unfavorable versus your prior thoughts? Relatively, are you seeing any incremental push-backs or demand impacts from this continued price increases that you are living in the market? Thank you.
Don Allan: Okay. So I’ll take the first part and then maybe I’ll pass the second question over to Jeff around pricing, but the – as far as the quarter what things we saw that were a little bit different than expectation, emerging markets clearly was lower to some extent. We expected some slowness, especially in Argentina and Turkey, but Mexico was a bit of a surprise given the events that happened in the middle of the quarter around the threats of potential tariffs that seemed to slow the markets a little bit in the back half of the quarter. So that was certainly a little bit different than expectation. When I look at kind of the retail tools performance, I think we’d say, it pretty much was in line with expectation. No real, unusual surprises there, either positive or negative in that regard.
Jim Loree: Although I think the POS was a positive surprise.
Jeff Ansell: Yes, the low down was kind of as expected.
Don Allan: The low-double digit POS is always a positive, probably above expectations. So that’s a fair point, Jim. But as far as our kind of revenue performance, there really wasn’t anything that really stood out as unusual, but that’s a great positive trend, as we think about execution in the back half of the year, especially the third quarter. And then industrial, slowing down a little bit, as we mentioned in the industrial tool business, was a little bit of difference versus expectations. However, we expected a lot of that slowness in our Industrial segment. Jeff, you want to take the price question?
Jeff Ansell: Yes, maybe two things to add. When we talk about industrial within tools, the industrial construction part of our business which is the hardcore construction part of the business continue to perform really well. POS was great. Growth was great. When you get into heavy duty manufacturing industrial like the industrial storage business and some of those things, they were pressured. So we continue to win in every part of construction. It was more of the industrial manufacturing part that was pressured a bit in the quarter. In regards to price in POS, you know, we’ve done everything we can to deal with the effects of price inside of our business, and then that has required us to pass on price to our customers as well because we – there is no way we could contain it all. But even as we’ve done that in the last – in the year to date basis, we’re up double-digit POS on a year-to-date basis, and that’s from everything from outdoor, through cordless power tools, brands everything. So we feel like we’ve done a really good job of managing price and volume to this point. The future, we will continue to stay really close to it, but we feel like we’ve done a pretty good job with our customers of managing the volume price equation. And as a result, robust POS is driving growth for us and our customers.
Don Allan: Yes. I think the other positive, even though it’s not a huge positive versus our expectations, but the – you know, the fact that Europe has been able to continue to be very strong, even in the face of tremendous uncertainty over there. Everything every – almost every country, you look at, you see political, geopolitical turmoil and economic stress and just limited growth. And so, I think the kind of mid single-digit growth performance in Europe continue to sustain that and I think that bodes well as well as Jeff said for the second half in Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Robert Barry: Hey guys, good morning.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Robert Barry: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. I think you are expecting Tool’s margins to be only very modestly up in 2Q and then much more meaningful in the back half, and it looks like 2Q ended up being more meaningful and now 3Q is going to be only pretty modest. So just curious what kind of drove the outperformance in 2Q or why that kind of shift is happening? And then just a quick follow-up on the Craftsman channel loading. When does that peak that contribution to growth? Thanks.
Don Allan: Okay. I’ll start with the margin question and pass the Craftsman question over to Jeff. Yes, we expected modest rate accretion in the second quarter for Tools & Storage. We ended up getting close to 80 bps of accretion in the second quarter. We still expect good accretion in the third quarter, not quite as much as 80 bps, but still a very healthy performance and then it gets even stronger in the fourth quarter. The second quarter really is just a factor of us being very focused on how we manage, as I mentioned in my comments, and we mentioned a fair several times over last year, really that balance between volume growth, pricing and making sure that we are focused both on organic growth and margin rate accretion performance. And I think the tools team did a great job managing that dynamic in the second quarter to get this type of performance. So a little bit of timing related to tariffs, where some of the tariffs shifted into the third quarter related to the new List 3 one going from 10% to 25%, that was a little bit of a positive that didn’t impact us in Q2. Just given the timing of it, but beyond that, it was really just strong execution by the tools team. Jeff, do you want to take the Craftsman question?
Jeff Ansell: Sure, Don. In regards to the question on Craftsman loading, I would say probably the loading itself anniversaries to a large degree in the fourth quarter. So if you look at the rollouts, we’ve been rolling out Craftsman for – on an increasing basis over six quarters. So it’s really – it’s the fourth quarter where it starts to anniversary most of the largest loads. At the same time, we stay really close to that POS and I think we’ve said before and I’ll say it again, the POS in Craftsman tend to be almost twice what it replaced in the categories that we’ve added it. So even though we’re anniversarying the loading, we still feel really good about the 3 points of incremental growth in our path to a $1 billion by 2021. So both of those things are – they’re positive at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Ken Zener: Good morning, gentlemen.
Jim Loree: Good morning, Kenny.
Ken Zener: Jeff, I wonder if you could comment, in the old days of Black & Decker, the outdoor power tool group had an effect on 2Q, obviously with your growing investment and insight into the outdoor power tool and given the very wet second quarter. Could you comment on any perhaps drag you saw there, but also – for whoever, how that might affect the execution of when you get a more, it’s a great business, but it becomes more seasonal, how that kind of affects perhaps operations or how you’d approach a very wet winter and how we should think about that going forward?
Jeff Ansell: Well, our result in outdoor has been really good. So we’re up mid single digits by 15% on a year-to-date basis. Some weeks 19%, and the best intelligence we have says the outdoor space would be up about a third of that. So that clearly represents share gain across Black & Decker, Craftsman and DEWALT. And I think the thing that’s changed over the last 25 years, I’ve been in the outdoor business is, we’ve become a much more prevalent player for a longer part of the season. So while we historically participated in the spring part of the other season, we’ve gotten far, far better at other categories where now that’s elongated well into the fall and early winter, blowers and some of those things that we historically hadn’t done. So the – if you think about it that way, we shipped those products in Q1, they sell in Q2, blowers and so forth happened in Q3, so outdoor has become – it’s a seasonal business, but it’s is now three quarters of our year versus what used to be one quarter of our year. And so all in all, I don’t think the season hasn’t impacted us. And I think the season in total was up a bit for – in the market, but ours was probably three times the market growth. But we feel good about that same prospect for the fall as well. We have really good promos and listings and so forth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.
Michael Wood: Hi, good morning.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Michael Wood: Can you give us any initial quantification of the 2020 carryover external headwinds from tariffs, FX commodities and potential offsets with the carryover from your cost actions. And you also called out less commodity inflation, just curious if you could pinpoint where you’re seeing that and does that become a year-over-year tailwind by year-end?
Jim Loree: Yes. So obviously, we will have a carry-over impact from the List 3 tariffs going from 10% to 25%. So we only have about a half-year impact of that this year. That’s roughly $70 million of an impact in 2019. So you can expect that to be roughly the same in 2020. The commodity impact or deflation impact or lower inflation is probably $15 million to $20 million this year, most of that hitting the fourth quarter. So we would expect a little bit of a carryover impact from that. It’s coming from things, certain steels and resins primarily that’s driving it. But we’re also seeing it in a couple of other categories. It’s kind of spread across various different categories. No one big one driving all of it. So, if things stay where they are, we would expect a carry-over impact. It may be as reasonably close to the tariff impact at this stage. So hopefully they neutralize themselves at this as we look at it right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Josh Wilson: Good morning. This is Josh filling in for Sam. Thanks for taking my question.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Josh Wilson: I want to dig in to the incremental pricing. You maintained your organic growth guidance for the year, but it was lower volume expectations offset by some incremental pricing. Could you give us some more color on which segments and which geographies that incremental pricing is coming in and what gives you confidence that those markets will support those increases? Thank you.
Don Allan: Well, I mean, we’ve been as you know, we’ve been getting price in the market for over a year now related to all these different headwinds and so some of these are going to start to anniversary themselves in the back half of the year. So, you’ll have a full year impact. We will have new pricing actions related to the List 3 going excuse me, going from 10% to 25% in the back half of this year. We’ve been running at about a two-point price impact. I would expect that probably would be somewhere between one point’s, to two points in the back half of the year, given that we’re starting to anniversary some of these things as likely being maybe closer to one versus two. So, the impact of price in our organic growth will be a little bit smaller than what we’ve experienced in the first half of the year and then obviously the offsetting impact to get to 4% organic growth will be volume, which means it will be a little bit bigger versus what you just mentioned.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ross Gilardi: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Ross Gilardi: I was just wondering if I could throw in a question on the Security business. I was interested in your comments on improving trends in what parts of the business are you seeing strength. And then just more broadly and while you’re clearly making a margin progress, you’re still a long way from the mid-teens operating margin objective that you want for the business. How would you look at it next year, if you’re still making positive progress, but you’re still well short of your margin targets with respect to retaining or divesting the business?
Don Allan: Well, the retaining or divesting of the business question is a question that we promised to answer a year, two years from a year ago in May. And right now, we’re not speculating on all these different aspects of and scenarios what-ifs, and so on. What we’re focused on is margin improvement and organic growth and transformation of the business model to make it a more relevant business model and a more defensible business model for the 2020s. And regardless of whether we elect to keep it or divest it, either way, the value that we’re creating by focusing on this is substantial and that’s the way we’re thinking about it right now. We don’t want to distract ourselves with having to evaluate what’s the right time to divest should we divest or what’s the right divestiture approach if we choose to do that. I mean there’s a lot of complexities associated with those questions which we’ll answer at the appropriate time. But for now, we’re focused on margin improvement, which we’ve accomplished at the beginnings of now and we’re and it’s mostly in the electronic business. I’ll tell you, it’s across the board in the electronic business where we’re focused on margin improvement and now we’re moving now that we have that going, we’re moving to an extreme focus on driving the value proposition and the go-to-market feet on the street, selling the applications that we’ve developed.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon thanks. We’d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for joining. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-24 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2019 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's first quarter 2019 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Jeff will review our first quarter 2019 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we'll be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent '34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
James Loree: Okay. Thank you, Dennis. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw on our press release, we delivered a strong start to 2019. The company posted solid quarterly revenue growth and overcame the carryover impact of commodity currency and tariff related headwinds to deliver modest earnings expansion. First quarter revenues were $3.3 billion, up 4% versus prior year. This included a robust 5% organic growth and 3% from acquisitions, which were partially offset by a 4-point currency headwind. Price continues to materialize with 2 points of growth attributable to price in the quarter. And Tools & Storage continued its impressive performance, delivering 7% organic growth with all regions and business units contributing. The tools team is leveraging a powerful set of catalysts complemented by an intense focus on commercial execution to consistently deliver above-market growth. And once again, Craftsman, e-commerce, new product innovation, and Irwin/Lenox helped propel the Tools & Storage performance. You'll hear more from Jeff Ansell on this during his remarks. Industrial, total revenues grew 10% as the Nelson and IES Attachments acquisitions were partially offset by automotive market pressure and currency. And Security demonstrated forward progress delivering both operating margin dollar and rate improvement versus 1Q 2018. And a year into our two-year strategic review process, the security team has a strategy along with a detailed plan and is in full execution mode on the business transformation. Don Allan will provide some more color during his remarks and we will cover in depth at our May 16 Investor Day. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.42, up 2%. With a sharp focus on cost control, our business teams delivered a strong operational performance and overcame approximately $160 million of 2018 carryover headwinds in the first quarter. Our outperformance was very encouraging as we contemplate prospects for the remainder of the year. Coupled with strong organic growth, we expect modest margin rate accretion for the total year with a return to near 15% levels in the back half, assuming a stable input cost and tariff environment. This is a simple function of price cost timing as the year unfolds. Moving to M&A, we also closed two strategic transactions in the quarter, completing our acquisition of the Pengo and Paladin businesses from IES, as well as our 20% equity investment in MTD, a large supplier of Craftsman outdoor power equipment, as well as owner of the Cub Cadet and Troy-Bilt brands. With IES Attachments, in combination with our hydraulic tools business, we now have a large portfolio of high-quality, performance-driven attachment solutions that creates a well-defined path for continued profitable growth. We expect IES to contribute approximately $300 million in revenue and be accretive to earnings in 2019. This asset has strong brands, deep customer relationships, and its independent dealer network has approximately 60% of its revenue related to aftermarket applications. Our focus is now on integration and achieving the cost and revenue synergies from the deal. Our minority investment in MTD represents a strategic bet on long-term growth in the $20 billion lawn and garden market, structured in a financially prudent manner. The transaction includes an option for us to purchase the remaining 80% in 2021 and beyond, and we're excited to partner with MTD, a leading outdoor gas-powered equipment manufacturer with a great history and a great team. And finally, based on our strong first quarter performance, we are raising our 2019 full-year adjusted EPS guidance by a nickel to a range of $8.50 to $8.70. So, in summary, 2019 is off to a good start. And our first quarter results provide us with good momentum and additional flexibility to execute and deliver the year. Leveraging our growth catalysts and SFS 2.0 operating system, we are continuing to lean into the external environment as the headwinds begin to dissipate. We remain focused on strong free cash flow generation and a return to operating margin expansion through productivity, cost control, and pricing. And, additionally, we are undertaking an extensive array of exciting new margin-focused initiatives to ensure rate expansion in 2019 and beyond. More to come on these initiatives at our Investor Day in a few weeks. And with that, I'll hand it over to Don Allan for a more detailed discussion on first quarter results and 2019 guidance. Don?
Donald Allan, Jr.: Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the first quarter. Tools & Storage revenue increased 3% as 7% organic growth was offset by 4 points of currency pressure. Organic growth included 5 points of volume and 2 points of price. We continue to see the benefits from the price actions we executed in the back half of 2018, as well as the additional price increases implemented this year in response to the List 3 tariffs. The operating margin rate for the segment was 12.1%, down from the prior year as the benefits of volume leverage, pricing and cost control were more than offset by the 2018 carryover impacts of currency, commodity inflation, and tariffs. These carryover headwinds amounted to $160 million for Stanley Black & Decker in the first quarter, with much of this impacting the Tools & Storage segment. The strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each region and SBU. So, looking at the results on a geographic basis, North America once again led the way, up 11% driven by the US retail channel, which posted high-teens growth. North America's growth continued to be fueled by the Craftsman brand rollout, new product innovations, and price realization. We continue to see great momentum with the Craftsman rollout at our major retail partners and have seen a strong end user reception as the product has hit the shelves. We couldn't be more pleased with the progress so far. More color to come on that, as well as our STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX rollouts from Jeff later. Europe delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter despite a continuation of slower market conditions across several countries within the region. The team continued to leverage our strong portfolio of brands, new product innovation and commercial actions to produce above-market growth. And then, finally, emerging markets delivered low single-digit growth, driven by price, new products and e-commerce expansion. These actions were largely offset by continued market contractions in Argentina and Turkey, which presented an organic growth headwind of 3 points within the quarter. We continue to see broad-based share gains across the region. Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico posted high-single to low double-digit growth, while Russia, Korea, Taiwan and India all posted strong double-digit performances. Now, let's take a look at the Tools & Storage SBUs. Both had solid contributions to the overall performance. Power tools and equipment delivered 6% organic growth, which benefited from strong commercial execution and new product introductions. In particular, we had a solid contribution from new products launched under the Craftsman, DeWalt and FlexVolt brands. Hand tools, accessories and storage delivered 9% organic growth as new product introductions, the Craftsman rollout and, of course, contributions from the Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies all contributed to this growth.  So, in summary, an outstanding quarter and a strong start to the year for the Tools & Storage organization as they continue to demonstrate above-market organic growth, tight cost control and strong price actions to overcome significant external headwinds related to commodities, currency and tariffs. Let's turn to Industrial. This segment delivered 10% revenue growth, which included 16 points from the Nelson Fastener and IES Attachments acquisitions, a 3% organic decline and a negative 3 points from currency offset this significant growth from these acquisitions. Operating margin rate was down year-over-year to 13.9%, as productivity gains and cost control actions were more than offset by the impact from lower engineered fastening automotive volume, commodity inflation and the modestly-dilutive impact from these acquisitions. Engineered fastening organic revenues were down 4% due to declines in automotive light vehicle production and lower system shipments, which were partially offset by continued fastener penetration gains. We continue to see declines in underlying global automotive production, which impacts fastener volumes. However, it is also impacting the scope of automotive system projects that our customers are executing. The infrastructure businesses delivered 5% organic growth, primarily driven by stronger North American onshore pipeline project activity in oil and gas. This was partially offset by lower hydraulic demolition tool volumes, whose underlying market has been modestly impacted by the recent retraction in scrap steel pricing. And, finally, let's turn to Security. The Security segment revenue declined 1% with bolt-on acquisitions contributing 2 points and price delivering 1%, which was more than offset by unfavorable currency of 4 points. North America organic growth was up 2% as higher volumes in automatic doors and healthcare were partially offset by lower installation revenues in commercial electronic security. Europe was down 1% organically. France was a bright spot for the quarter as the team was able to leverage new commercial actions in the small to medium enterprise market, which is associated with our transformation plan that Jim mentioned. However, this was more than offset by unfavorable market conditions in Sweden and the UK, two larger markets for our security European team. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 10.3%. The security team continues to demonstrate progress with its business transformation plan. They successfully executed on their first quarter objectives, delivering margin rate and dollar expansion through cost control, and they are focused on minimizing recurring revenue attrition. So, we achieved modest organic growth. Additionally, the team continues to make investments in hiring and onboarding new commercial and field technician resources. We believe these actions, coupled with the new technology forward customer solutions we have developed and are developing, will begin to translate into consistent growth as we move forward in the year. This is the third quarter in a row, our security team has achieved their financial expectations. Nice progress so far. So, now, let's briefly look at the quarter's free cash flow performance on the next page. We were down approximately $65 million year-over-year, mainly attributed to increased working capital. Tools & Storage continues to carry high levels of inventory to support the ongoing Craftsman rollout and other brand transitions that we are currently executing across the channels. As mentioned at January's earnings call, we believe the working capital levels will moderate throughout the year, and we will achieve working capital turns relatively flat to the prior year by the end of 2019. This will position us well for driving significant working capital improvement in 2020, so we can achieve approximately 100% free cash flow conversion in 2020. So, turning back to 2019, please keep in mind that a free cash outflow in the first quarter is in line with normal seasonality. We remain confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation for the year, given our core SFS processes and principles, combined with reducing working capital levels, in line with normal seasonal activity as I just discussed.  Therefore, we are reiterating our commitment to deliver a free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 85% to 90% in 2019. So, now, let's turn to 2019 earnings guidance. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are raising our adjusted EPS outlook for 2019 to a range of $8.50 to $8.70, which is a $0.05 increase versus our prior guidance. On a GAAP basis, this results in a range of $7.50 to $7.70 per share.  Diving into a little more detail on our 2019 adjusted EPS, you can see on the left hand side of the chart, the increase is supported by the strong organic growth and cost control, which drove approximately $0.15 of operational outperformance in the first quarter. This is partially offset by an incremental $20 million of currency headwinds, which primarily consists of adverse movements in the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso and Chinese RMB. As it relates to recent acquisitions and divestiture activity, the impact from the acquisition of the Paladin and Pengo businesses from IES and the divestiture of Sargent and Greenleaf led to a relatively neutral impact to our full-year 2019 EPS outlook. These IES assets will create solid EPS accretion in the later years through cost and revenue synergies. One other item of note I would like to highlight is that we expect second quarter earnings per share to approximate 29.5% of the full-year performance. This is generally consistent with prior-year performance. Turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, organic growth within Tools & Storage is still expected to be mid-single digits in 2019. We continue to execute on multiple catalysts, including the continued brand transitions with Craftsman, STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX, new product innovation, including FlexVolt, Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, e-commerce and other emerging market opportunities. The margin rates are expected to be positive year-over-year. The team will continue to leverage price, cost actions, margin initiatives and volume to offset the carryover headwinds we previously mentioned. We believe the business is well positioned for return to margin expansion in 2019 and anticipate a meaningful expansion in the second half. In the Industrial segment, we expect organic revenue to be down modestly with total revenue growth positive from the contributions of our recent acquisitions. In infrastructure, we expect oil and gas to be positive organically and hydraulic tools to be relatively flat on an organic basis. Engineered fastening organic revenue is expected to be down modestly with growth in automotive and industrial fasteners being offset by a decline in the systems side of the business. We do believe the pressure we experienced in the automotive systems during Q1 will begin to subside in the later stages of 2019. We expect operating margins to be down year-over-year driven by the modestly dilutive impact from acquisitions and the impacts of negative product mix, specifically, lower automotive system sales in engineered fastening. And then, finally, in our Security segment, we're expecting organic growth of low-single digits and growth in operating margin dollars and rate year-over-year as the team continues to execute on its transformation strategy. So, in summary, the company's organic revenue will grow approximately 4% and we expect 4% to 7% adjusted EPS expansion, which is overcoming approximately $340 million of commodity, currency and tariff headwinds, which is primarily related to the carryover from 2018. We are encouraged by the collective performances across the portfolio in the first quarter, which gives us confidence to increase our 2019 EPS guidance range. We remain focused on leveraging the positive impacts from our continued strong organic growth, the previously executed pricing actions, and the recently completed $250 million cost reduction program to ensure we achieve our 2019 guidance. These factors, along with the beginning impacts of certain margin enhancement initiatives, will result in operating margin and rate expansion in 2019, and we expect meaningful expansion in the second half of the year. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff to provide a few comments on the progress with the ongoing Craftsman, STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX brand transitions as well as some of the new innovations we are currently launching within the Tools business. Jeff?
Jeffery Ansell: Thank you, Don. I'd like to share a few updates on our latest innovations and brand initiatives, including our recent launch of a new DeWalt 20 volt compact series called Atomic, as well as the incredible progress of Craftsman. Our global Tools & Storage business had strong first quarter performance, with high single-digit organic growth led by North America. A key component of this success was our continued focus on innovation-led growth. For example, our DeWalt FlexVolt platform was up double-digits in the quarter as we continued to grow, in the system, our core products as well as expanding into the outdoor category with FlexVolt. We're also pleased to announce the global launch of the 20-volt Atomic series, a range of tools that combines performance and durability in a compact format. The Atomic series augments our existing DeWalt 20 volt line, which is now the largest professional cordless system in the world, with well over 200 products. With this global program just beginning to ship, we expect to see incremental growth in the pro power tool space within the year. During our May Investor Day, we will detail this and other breakthrough innovations.  Regarding Craftsman, the momentum and success from 2018 carried into 2019, with growth across all categories in Craftsman. Our Craftsman expansion plan remains on track and we are well on our way to delivering our $1 billion target by 2021. Now, I'll turn it back over to Jim to wrap today's presentation.
James Loree: Thanks, Jeff. And as you heard, it was a solid start to the year as we delivered above-market organic growth, leveraging that array of growth catalysts. I'm proud of the team's efforts and execution, which have positioned us to achieve decent LTM financial results, amidst a host of macro challenges. As these challenges anniversary, we're looking forward to a resumption of margin accretion in combination with our excellent growth. And lastly, I want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Day on the morning of May 16th in New York City. This will be a great opportunity for us to communicate our strategic and financial objectives, and discuss how we are pursuing growth, margin expansion and transformation at Stanley Black & Decker. As you can tell, we are passionate about delivering growth with margin expansion and this will be prominently featured. We will also showcase members of our business unit and other key functional management teams. So, please reach out to Dennis if you're interested in attending, and we look forward to seeing you there. And we're now ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
James Loree: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Sprague: Jim, I was wondering if you could address a little bit more – as you said in your opening monologue that the headwinds are dissipating. And I think we all kind of understand the comp issue and how it was front-loaded here in Q1. But can you provide a little bit more color on how you see that playing out in the back half? And, I guess, part and parcel to my question is, it does look like we might be getting close to trade tariff resolution. And how do you think about maintaining price if we do get tariff relief? Thank you.
James Loree: Sure. Well, first of all, the massive hit that we took in the first quarter from the carryover headwinds goes down sequentially in the second quarter, but it's still over $100 million – sorry, just below $100 million. Right around $85 million. And then, in the back half of the year, the price actually more or less offsets the remaining headwinds, the remaining carryover and whatever modest headwinds that we have this year. So, in general, that's just how the math works. And so, as I said, assume a stable cost and tariff environment. If the tariffs go away, that's a pretty significant reduction in headwinds. I think the total amount of tariffs for the year is just under $100 million or thereabouts. So, most of the tariff impact is List three3. And from what we hear, the way the trade negotiations are going, that would be the most likely tariffs to be removed, List 3. And keeping in mind, to the last part of your question, a lot of the pricing activity was not tariff related, but also inflation related. And so, I think that when you finally add it all up, the price recovery against the tariffs only amounted to between 40% and 50%. And so, there was a big chunk of inflation-related cost that was not covered by the price as well as some of the tariffs. So, I think that – we'll see how that all plays out, but I think there's sufficient inflation and headwinds to justify a fairly stable price environment going forward.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Let me just clarify that the number that Jim gave on 2Q was net of price. I just want to make sure people understand that's not gross headwinds. And the other thing to keep in mind is if all the tariffs went away – we've communicated this previously – the impact net of price on an annualized basis would probably be somewhere around $40 million to $50 million. But that's all tariff. And if List 3 happens, it's probably a third to 50% of that number.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, guys.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Yeah. I guess, just to follow-up on Jeff's question there with the margin expansion that you guys talked about in Tools. I think, Don, you mentioned a few times, strong margin expansion in the second half. Should we still expect to see something in 2Q and how has that changed, just given maybe some of the timing of headwinds or price increases or the competitive dynamic out there with respect to price?
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. As we were saying over the last couple of months, we were anticipating a kind of modest improvement in margin rate in the second quarter. And we still believe that will be the case. And as we get into the third and the fourth quarter, both Jim and I indicated, we expect the incremental accretion rate for Tools to become quite meaningful, and that's still the expectation at this stage.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
James Loree: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Rehaut: Congrats on the quarter. Question I have relates to the Tools & Storage performance. Obviously, you continued great execution on the top line. Given some of the new initiatives that you launched, or Jeff referred to, I was hoping to get a sense of what you think about the mid-single digit growth for the segment for 2019. If you can kind of break that down by looking at also the – break it down by some of the growth initiatives [indiscernible] such as Craftsman, such as FlexVolt as opposed to the core market growth and if that's changed at all, particularly given the first quarter performance?
James Loree: Yeah. As we've indicated previously, we think Craftsman is about 3 points of growth for the full year. The first quarter was fairly representative of that. And we don't see any different view at this stage. We've indicated mid-single-digits. We've also said that that probably means we're – our view is we are floating around 6% and possibly 7%, and we still feel like that's the right estimate at this stage. What we don't know is just how impactful Craftsman is going to be. It's been very positive. And if those trends continue, those numbers can be a little bit better as the year goes on. But I look at the core underlying markets, they're performing well. We had some weak markets in Europe, as we talked about, where we don't have a lot of market growth right now in many of the countries, but we are demonstrating growth as we had 3% organic growth in the first quarter. So, we're outpacing there. And that really has more to do with just strong commercial activities, product innovation, et cetera, like the European team has done for several years now. In North America, you saw the magnitude of the growth of double-digits and the impact of Craftsman being in there. But even if you exclude that impact, it's still pretty significant performance, which would include things like FlexVolt and other matters as well. So, we still feel like that's a reasonable estimate at this stage. We all have to keep in mind that it is the first quarter. And as we get to the second quarter and we complete the rollout of Craftsman and Lowe's through all the different stores. We'll have a good sense of where we are and a read in the back half of the year and what that means. But I think, at this stage, we feel good about an organic growth number about 6% to 7% for Tools.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: Hey, guys. Good morning. Good start to the year.
James Loree: Good morning. Thank you.
Tim Wojs: I guess just maybe on – back on Tools and growth in the quarter, relative to your expectations a couple of months ago, where do you think you saw the outperformance internally? Was it better sell-through at retail? Was it the types of products that consumers are buying? Just a little bit more color on maybe what was better relative to your expectations in the quarter.
James Loree: I guess, kind of all of the above. The sell-through has been fantastic and the product introductions have been really well received. And so, it's a combination of all those factors. And I think also, the market is more stable than, I think, we were thinking a quarter ago, although there is some choppiness in housing and so on. I think, in general, it's more stable than we would have expected at this point in time. And the interest rate reductions have helped a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell: Thanks. Good morning. You've given some very good color on your updated sort of macro thoughts around North America demand. I just wondered if you could give us an update around expectations for organic growth firm-wide in Europe and the emerging markets. Those were sort of flattish both in Q1. Just wondered how you think the rest of the year will play out for Europe and EM.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. I think what we experienced in Q1 is not going to be dramatically different other than, I would say, probably emerging markets might start to demonstrate more growth as we get to the back half. They clearly are dealing with some difficult circumstances in two countries that I mentioned, of Turkey and Argentina. But we do start to kind of lap that in the middle of the year, and so the comp gets a little easier from that perspective to demonstrate organic growth. So, I think we'll see a little bit of an improvement in the organic growth profile in the back half for emerging markets. But I think Europe will continue to be kind of a low-single digit growth performance for a good part of the year and North America will continue to be strong.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
James Loree: Hi, Nigel.
Nigel Coe: I'm sure you're glad to get 1Q behind you. So, it's, obviously, great news on SG&A. Big reduction there. And I'm assuming that's where the bulk of the cost action is coming through in that line. I know you're going to address this more on the upcoming May conference, but maybe you could talk about the margin transformation initiatives underway, and is that more of a capacity and gross margin initiative? And how does that differ from some of the regular way restructuring you're currently doing? Thanks.
James Loree: Sure. So, the margin resiliency initiative, we like to call it, gets us back to kind of our historical margin accretion of about 50 basis points a year after we get back to our prior levels, which we will accomplish pretty much this year, start to have margin accretion again. And so, really, the intent of this is – it may have a modest 2019 impact, but the real impact will be 2021 and we'll be driving that 50 basis point and possibly even more margin accretion going forward. And we'll get into a fair amount of detail about this in – on May 16th. But the general thrust is utilizing technology and technological advancements to enhance value-creation initiatives that already exist. So, it could be as it relates to price, it could be as it relates to procurement and so on. So, there's different categories or buckets, if you will, where we're taking technology and utilizing kind of leading-edge practices to data analytics, artificial intelligence, cobotics, those types of things to actually enhance our margins and create value. That's the basic idea.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Nicole DeBlase: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning.
Nicole DeBlase: So, I just wanted to dig into 2Q a little bit. It seems like that's the thing that the investors are asking about most or grappling with since – it seems like it's not a whole lot different than normal seasonality for me, but, essentially, consensus is doubling versus 1Q excluding the tax benefit. So, if you guys could kind of talk through the big puts and takes. I know we talked about the $85 million net headwind. What's the gross headwind expected? If you could talk through organic growth since I think the comp gets a bit tougher year-on-year, tax rate, and anything else that we need to consider when we're thinking about bridging from 1Q to 2Q?
Donald Allan, Jr.: Clearly, the volume overall is the biggest driver where the volume of the whole company will probably be up $400 million to $450 million sequentially from Q1 to Q2. So, that's clearly a big driver. You also have – the gross headwinds go down on an absolute basis by about $30 million to $35 million from Q1 to Q2, while the price benefit stays relatively consistent. So, you get a benefit there as well. And then, some of our cost actions were not completed until Q1. So, you get a full quarter benefit of that in Q2. Those are really the three main drivers that are driving that. There is a little bit of a modest impact from a lower tax rate in Q2 versus Q1, as well as many of the tax benefits we're expecting in the first half versus the back half of the year. Those are the four main drivers that would get you to that number.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning.
Joe Ritchie: Maybe just touching on the focus of the Analyst Day. I know we're going to talk a lot about the margin expansion. But maybe just a broader question around, like, is this a pivot? You guys have been focused very much so on the growth initiatives historically the 22/22. And now, it seems like this Analyst Day is going to be a little bit more focused on the margin expansion opportunities. And so, maybe discuss a little bit just kind of the shift in philosophy there.
James Loree: It's not really a huge shift in philosophy. It's really kind of back to the future. We've always in the last, I'd say, five to seven years we have always been focused on growth and margin expansion. And if you go back and look at the years preceding last year, there is a pretty strong track record of strong organic growth, acquisitive growth, plus margin expansion. And that formula has been very lucrative for shareholders and we intend to get back to that. So, the reason we, obviously, got off that track through one year has everything to do with the headwinds that we've talked about ad nauseam. So, this is something that we are fixated on doing in this company is doing both. And I know a lot of companies that see it as either/or. But we don't think of it that way. And we have the capability and the track record to expand margins while growing, and we intend to get back to that beginning in 2019, but really in earnest in 2020 and 2021.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Deepa Raghavan: Good morning. Good quarter there, Jim and Don.
James Loree: Thank you.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Thank you.
Deepa Raghavan: Your outlooks for Q2, just a little bit touching on that given that it's an outdoors season, heavy season, outlooks looks like it's 250-ish at midpoint. Can you talk about momentum into Q2 including possibly any point of sales [indiscernible] North America and what are some of the upside and downside case in Q2? We know it's an outdoor season. It's meaningful to Craftsman/MTD just the weather in there. But on a year-on-year basis, is there anything else that other than what you've addressed earlier? That would be helpful. Thank you.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. So, I'll pass it over to Jeff in a minute to maybe give us some commentary on the outdoor season view for us. But as I mentioned and Jim mentioned, the POS was strong in the first quarter. We do think that trend will continue into the second quarter and likely for the remainder of the year. The other drivers are the reason for why we think the business will continue to improve around margin rate in the second quarter, so we can achieve what I described. But let me give Jeff a chance to give a little bit more color on our view of the outdoor season.
Jeffery Ansell: So, to reiterate what Don just said, POS was robust as were the organic growth numbers in North America in Q1. There is not a great deal of outdoor activity in that quarter. It more starts in the second quarter, runs through the third. But what we did see was a slow start to the outdoor season, as much of the US market was underwater, if you remember, early days of the spring. That changed quite significantly in the last four weeks. So, a season that started out negative has turned positive at this point, certainly, for us. And we're comping relatively sluggish outdoor numbers from last year. If you remember, last year's outdoor season wasn't a really robust one. So, it's been really positive for the last four weeks and we have every reason to believe it will continue to be positive through the second quarter, one, given the kind of sluggish comps from last year, but also the new product development that we put into the market this year in the DeWalt brand as well as the Black & Decker brand and, most recently, the Craftsman brand. So quite positive.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, good morning. I just wonder if you could give any kind of an update on Craftsman production, US production, just progress. And then, any thoughts on evolutions at MTD and if you're able to achieve better results through rating [ph] them? Thanks.
Donald Allan, Jr.: I'll start with the first part of the question, then turn it over to Jim for the second part. Craftsman domestic manufacturing is in a really good place. We essentially began the process with almost no domestic manufacturing for Craftsman and what we procured. To this point, over the course of about 12 months, we've gone from what was almost 0% to about a third of the product line manufactured domestically today on our plan to double that going forward, which we'll give you more detail around that at the May Investor Day. But the inertia created by Craftsman, and then combining that with domestic manufacturing, the combination of those two things has led us to growth in every category that is Craftsman today. So, we're quite pleased with where we are. But I would say. we have yet a lot to do.
Jeffery Ansell: Great. So, on MTD, really excited about the transaction, including the option. But as excited about the people that we get to work with because, frankly, the transaction has got this – got us all set up with a confluence of interests in the sense that any EBITDA growth that occurs will kind of share the benefits post-closing of the 20%, will share the benefits 50/50 in terms of the ultimate determination of the option price. And that structure has put us in a position where we are working together in earnest on value creation opportunities for MTD that include everything from growth to cost reduction, to margin expansion and so on. And it's going to be a multi-year program. And as we're running it like an acquisition integration, while subscribing to all the principles of antitrust that we have to subscribe to, and we're very confident that we will get MTD's profitability up to a point where it will be able to slot it into our portfolio in 2021 or 2022 in a way that is really accretive for us and is a great deal for the folks at MTD.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Justin Speer: Hey, guys. Thank you very much. I just wanted to further unpack the Tools & Storage growth and what you're looking for underlying market growth for this business and how that kind of sequences as the year progresses? And then, dovetailing that question with, is the reality that if we do get trade resolution, do you think you'll be able to hold on to most of that price? Do you think you'll be able to hold on to the potential savings from tariffs going away?
James Loree: Yeah. As I mentioned on growth earlier for Tools & Storage, we have a view of 6% to 7% for the full year. We expect Craftsman to be about 3 points of that, which would demonstrate some modest growth over GDP, if you look at it globally, not assume being a point or point and a half. So, that's pretty significant in some camps around the world. But that's our view and we think that will continue to be the case. And we're very hopeful that Craftsman outperforms expectations, and maybe some other product innovations and other growth catalysts do as well. And we'll see as the year progresses. We talked about how we have a lot of work to do on Craftsman to complete the rollout in the second quarter. And then, we have to focus on the rollout of other brands and some of our other customers. So, we have a lot of work to do over the year to make this happen. But we're positive at this stage and we'll continue to provide updates along the way, in particular in July and October.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Robert Barry: Hey, guys. Good morning.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning.
Robert Barry: Congrats on the solid start.
James Loree: Thanks.
Robert Barry: I just wanted to actually clarify a couple of things. One is, just why the Industrial outlook is weaker and how much of that weakness happened in 1Q? And then, just on a couple P&L items, that price and commodities are still kind of plus 150, minus 150 and if there is any kind of potential upside or downside to those values just based on what we're seeing with commodities?
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. I think for Industrial, our view is a little bit worse than it was in January as we saw the automotive light vehicle production was down almost 5% in the first quarter, which was worse than projections. It's supposed to be down a little bit, smaller number in the second quarter, and then begin to moderate in the back half of the year. We do think systems will start to return in the back half of the year. That's the feedback we're getting from a lot of our key customers.  And so, that's clearly a pressure point, although it's a modest pressure point versus expectations. I think we were thinking relatively flat back in January. Now, we're just down modestly as a result of that.  I think the engineered fastening team is doing a great job managing through this cycle with the auto industry and looking for opportunities in some of the – and the Nelson acquisition that they've done as well as the other aspects of the Industrial fastener business within their world. So, they continue to be focused on that. The headwinds, as we mentioned, have gone up a little bit overall, $20 million due to FX. And at this stage, commodities are not changing dramatically. Although, we think as we go through the year that could be an opportunity that we see emerge as the year goes on. But. right now, it's not flowing through as an opportunity for us to capture in our P&L at this stage. And then, tariffs are bit of an open wild card at this stage as to what happens. Do we have a deal with China in the future? And if we do, do all the tariffs go away? Or as Jim said, do they partially go away? It is a factor that we see. But we feel good about where we're positioned as a company to deal with these headwinds, even though we saw modest increase in them. It feels like, as we go throughout the year, the ones in commodities and tariff feel like there is a possibility for an opportunity [indiscernible] to get smaller. However, we could potentially see a little bit more pressure in currency as we go throughout the year. We certainly saw the volatility of that last year, but I think that –currency tends to be something that's easier for us to manage if that's the only major headwind we are dealing with.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.
Michael Wood: Hi. Good morning. I was hoping you could provide some color in terms of the – you gave a very explicit 1Q guidance, which you beat operationally, you said, by about $0.25 – sorry, $0.15 or so excluding the timing of the tax. Curious if there was some other pull forward in 1Q that didn't allow you to flow that $0.15 beat into your 2019 guidance?
Donald Allan, Jr.: As I mentioned in my commentary, is that we actually did have an operational outperformance of $0.15 in the first quarter, but we did see a $20 million increase in currency or $0.10 of an impact related to that. So, the net benefit is about $0.05. And we felt, at this stage, the prudent thing to do, to let that flow through. Let's see if we get resolution on China trade. Let's see if some of the trends that I had mentioned emerge in the volume of Tools, as well as the headwinds associated with commodity and tariffs. And so, it's a prudent first step and we'll see how things progress in the next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David MacGregor: Yes. Good morning.
James Loree: Good morning.
David MacGregor: Congratulations on a good quarter.
James Loree: Thanks.
David MacGregor: Just on Craftsman, thinking about second quarter and the dynamics around the Craftsman brand, can you update us on the timing of the load-in? I think you mentioned earlier that, Lowe's, you expected that to be complete in the second quarter. But have you started the Amazon load-in yet? And if so, how far into that process are you? And finally, can you update us on the timing of the load-in Home Depot on the STANLEY and FATMAX and how long that will take to complete? Thanks.
Jeffery Ansell: Yeah. This is Jeff. I'll take the question. I'll give you the status first of STANLEY, STANLEY FATMAX and then we'll migrate to Craftsman. We've just begun the process of rolling out the STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX products that we highlighted last earnings call. So, they are just flowing through the supply chain, into stores. You will see those product set – the first phase of that set this coming month. So, in the month of May, you'll see those things set at store level. So, no underlying POS or any of that at this point, but the rollout is going quite well. And so, we're very positive on that. Regarding Craftsman, probably similarly, we've had greater demand for the product than we anticipated. And as such, we've expanded our view of the size of Craftsman and the timing of Craftsman previously. In order to make certain that we can accommodate that increased demand via supply, we have elected to move the rollout of new customers on Craftsman to the early parts of the second half of this year. So, in an attempt to make sure, we can satisfy the customers that we do have today and the demand that the end user has created, we pushed those back just a bit, but they will begin very early second half, and we'll roll those things out in the cadence we described, but starting at that point and time. So, all positive underlying reasons to do those things. And again, we're quite positive with both the rollout of STANLEY, STANLEY FATMAX and Craftsman across all categories.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Ken Zener: Good morning, everybody.
James Loree: Hey, Ken.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning.
Ken Zener: Jeff, can you talk to the outdoor category given MTD and Craftsman? Specifically kind of a bigger picture, but what constraints the expansion of cordless applications into gas? Is it your guys' internal R&D? Is it just the market price? Or you don't want to be the bleeding edge? Thank you very much.
Jeffery Ansell: Well, it has advanced quite significantly in the last, you'd say, two years, right? So, there have been cordless – non-gas cordless outdoor products from us for almost three decades. But the cost curve has enabled us to beat us and others to get electric products competitively priced with petrol really for the first time in the last 12 months. And at that point, then the consumer has the decision to make. They would either choose petrol, which they are accustomed to today, or migrate to electric. And that's a process that's beginning as we speak. So, I'd say the technology enables that today. So, you see this in categories like string trimmers, hedge trimmers, blowers, chainsaws, things that historically have been gas driven. And that migration has happened relatively rapidly and you'll see – if you survey retail today, you'll see examples under the Craftsman brand where we have NCAP's registration that says, you choose your power source. So, it will be gas product or the electric equivalent at the same price, allowing the user to make the decision, which has been the first time in history we've ever been able to make that claim or do that. And it's going really well. So, I don't think there's any technological hurdles with it, in that sense. As you get into higher and higher output products, walk behinds, ride-on mowers, there is still a gap between the value proposition of petrol or gas and electric. And we and others are working to close that gap, but there's probably a little more work to be done there. But the early read is very positive and the electrification of outdoor products being led really by us across brands like Black & Decker, DeWalt and Craftsman. So...
Donald Allan, Jr.: One of the things that we're doing to take advantage of this period where we own 20% of MTD and have not yet exercised the option is to collaborate on R&D because it's an application challenge. It's not just a battery challenge. It's a system challenge. So, their expertise in the actual units of outdoor power equipment as we go up the power curve and our expertise in battery technology and application to lower power output type products, it's a great combination – best combination in the industry to tackle this and we're going to be out in front on that one.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Susan Maklari: Good morning.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning.
Susan Maklari: I wanted to focus a little bit on the cash flows and the balance sheet. On the last call, you talked to taking a defensive approach to cash flows this year with a focus on deleveraging. And with the operating environment coming in a bit more stable relative to your initial expectations, are there any changes to your capital allocation plans for this year?
Donald Allan, Jr.: There really isn't any significant changes to our capital allocation strategy. As we thought about January, we are preparing the company for a slow growth environment. And we were concerned about housing, in particular, what was happening as interest rates had been rising in the previous year and there was talk about continued increases in that area and what that could mean for housing. As Jim mentioned, that's changed a lot in the last three months where now the Fed has a different kind of position on interest rates and, actually, we've seen a little bit of a reversal in that trend, and that's had a bit of a positive impact on housing. But we're still dealing with a relatively – a little bit of a slow growth environment in certain pockets. We have a slow automotive industry. Housing is doing okay, but it's not robust at this stage. And so, we're not overly concerned about the economy at this view. We feel good about how we've set up the company and to be prepared for, as we mentioned, various different environments, and this was one of them. And the importance of our capital allocation is, we have to keep in mind that, in the previous couple of years, we've done some significant capital allocation transactions, including buying back stock, acquisitions of IES, MTD, Nelson Fasteners and then, before that, we had Craftsman and we had the Newell Tools acquisition. So, we've allocated a fair amount of capital to these different areas. So, a couple of things are happening this year. One, we want to get our debt to EBITDA ratio down closer to two times and we will achieve that with the current cash flow view and projection of the business. And that will really position us to be able to look at other allocation strategies in the M&A world as we go into 2020. And, frankly, we need to absorb a lot of those transactions that we've completed in that timeframe as well.
James Loree: There is a massive amount of execution going on as you can glean from the conversations that we've had in the last hour, and it's all going really well. But as Don said, we kind of want to get our debt-to-EBITDA down to right around 2 and digest some of these things and exploit some of the growth opportunities that we have. And then, we'll look in, as we go into 2020 and beyond, does more repurchase make sense or do we have some acquisition opportunities that might be very attractive to help us continue to drive growth?
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Justin Bergner with G Research. Your line is open.
Justin Bergner: Good morning. And thank you for taking my question.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Good morning.
Justin Bergner: You made a comment earlier in the call that you're hoping to reach 100% or close to a 100% free cash flow conversion in 2020. I'm not sure, but it seems like that's a pull forward of your earlier comment that that was more of a mid-term goal. Could you clarify that's the case and sort of maybe indicate what drivers will allow you to get that free cash flow conversion up to 100% 2020?
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. I think one of the things that we've talked about in the last year or so is that we've had to really take some pressure on in our working capital as we dealt with these brand transitions which are fantastic opportunities for us to develop organic growth, and you've seen that track record in the Tools & Storage business. And, therefore, we haven't seen significant progress in working capital turns in the last – previous year as well as this year, we'll probably be relatively flat year-over-year.  So, as we go into 2020, we see opportunity once those transitions has kind of gotten to a more stable state on a go-forward basis, and they're really embedded in our existing business. And then, we're dealing more with just new product introductions and new innovations, et cetera. That gives us an opportunity for us to make some significant improvement in working capital turns where we'll end this year probably somewhere between 8.5 and 8.8 for working capital turns as a company. And, therefore, we've been over 10. And so, there's no reason why we can't see that opportunity going into 2020 and 2021, which means that significant benefit will flow through free cash flow, which will allow our conversion to get back up to 100%.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-22 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will be available beginning at 11 a.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Jeff will review our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller, and as we normally do, we'll be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent '34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
James Loree: Okay. Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you saw in today's release, we delivered a respectable fourth quarter, continuing our trajectory of above-market organic growth and delivering strong EPS growth and solid free cash flow dollars and conversion. As many of you know, in 2018, we faced an unusual and sudden onslaught of large and volatile external headwinds, most of which developed during the course of the year, specifically pressure from input cost inflation, FX and tariffs had, by fourth quarter, grown from our initial January guidance of $150 million pretax to $370 million, which at the EPS level, would have been about 25% dilutive to prior year EPS had we not managed to offset all but $50 million of that with additional price/cost management and other actions. The fact that we ended up delivering 9% adjusted EPS growth in 2018 on 8% revenue growth, which included 5% organic, is quite remarkable. It speaks volumes as to how agile experience - agile our experienced management team deals with short-term adversity and operating environment challenges while continuing to pursue above-market growth and moving the company forward strategically. More on that in a few minutes, but first, a few words about the fourth quarter. Revenues were up 5% to $3.6 billion with organic growth of 6%. Tools & Storage delivered 7% organic with strength in all major geographies and business units. The Tools growth was driven by the continued rollout of the Craftsman brand, price realization and leveraging our portfolio of growth catalysts. Industrial delivered 14% total revenue growth inclusive of the Nelson Fastener acquisition, and organic was up 4% for Industrial. The Oil & Gas business exceeded our plan this quarter and delivered a robust 27% organic growth derived from increased pipeline project activity in North America. Our total company adjusted operating margin rate was 13.3% as volume leverage, price and cost actions were more than offset by the impact of currency, commodity, inflation and tariffs. Security was a bright spot this quarter, delivering both operating margin dollar and rate improvement versus a year ago. The Security team is energized and focused, and we are looking forward to realizing a significant and growing benefit from that business' transformation as 2019 unfolds. EPS for the quarter was $2.11, in line with expectations. And now I'll turn to full year highlights. Full year revenues were $14.0 billion, up 8%, including 5% organic growth and 3 points from acquisitions. Excluding charges, diluted EPS for the year was $8.15, a 9% increase versus 2017, and our operating margin rate remained solid at 13.6% despite absorbing the $370 million of headwinds previously mentioned. Turning to capital allocation. We continued our balanced approach once again in 2018. During the year, we repurchased $500 million of our shares and increased the dividend once again, the 51st consecutive year of increases. From an M&A point of view, we closed on Nelson Fasteners, which further diversifies the Engineered Fastening business into industrial markets. We also announced the IES Attachments acquisition and our entry into large outdoor power equipment with MTD as our equity partner. We're excited to see these opportunities progress and fuel future growth in the coming years. In summary, 2018 was a successful year, one in which we cut through challenges to deliver solid results. This performance is attributable to the agility, passion and dedication of our workforce, and I want to take this opportunity to thank every employee for their commitment and their resolve because it is our people to whom we attribute this great culture and the passion to perform well in any environment. They live our purpose every day with incredible energy and commitment. As we enter 2019, the external challenges don't magically disappear. However, we are well-prepared and positioned to tackle them. In addition, there are signs that the global economic growth is slowing and that the U.S. economy may soon be coming to the end of one of the most enduring recoveries in U.S. history. We are leaning into these challenges and will leverage our SFS 2.0 operating system while deploying an impressive array of growth and margin improvement initiatives to once again be successful in 2019. The investments we've made to support organic growth and our recent acquisitions have created the strongest pipeline of revenue-generating catalysts we've ever had during my almost 20 years as a C-level Executive in this company. These opportunities will provide a foundation for continued share gain and can act as a buffer to the revenue impact that could result from potentially slower markets. We will see benefits in 2019 from the rollout of the Craftsman brand, the largest product program in our history, as well as the repositioning of the Stanley and the Stanley FatMax brands in the North American home center channel. With these programs, we are unlocking new opportunities for share gain by aligning our brands across core user groups within the Tradesman and Professional segments while leveraging our brands fully with our retail partners. The response we have seen from our customers and end users with the Craftsman rollout encourages us regarding the potential for 2019 and beyond. Our core and breakthrough innovation initiatives are stronger than ever, and our innovation focus permeates the entire company. We expect to see future revenue benefits not only from FLEXVOLT, which is a well-traveled story, but also from new innovations coming to market in Tools, Fastening and other Industrial businesses as well as Security. In terms of the Lenox/Irwin acquisitions, we're attacking the revenue synergy opportunities which will represent $100 million to $150 million of organic growth over a multiyear period as we broaden the distribution of these products around the world. In the emerging markets, we continue to deliver outsized growth and share gain, and we are leveraging our unique business model, the strength of our brands, including Stanley-branded midpoint - mid-price-point corded and cordless power tools as well as hand tool products. And we're having immense success growing at 2 to 3x the market rate. And across both developed and emerging markets, e-commerce remains a key revenue growth driver for us. This year, it represents a $1 billion high-growth business, a channel in which we are the industry leader across the globe by a wide margin. And turning to our recent acquisitions, in addition to the organic growth opportunities I mentioned with Craftsman and Lenox/Irwin, we expect to generate inorganic growth from the IES acquisition in 2019, for which we are awaiting government approvals. Additionally, as I said earlier, our MTD partnership is just getting started, and we are excited about the future benefits from this relationship. As part of the deal, we have secured an option to purchase the remaining 80% in 2021 and beyond for an amount which should approximate 7 to 8x EBITDA. This provides clear visibility to almost $3 billion of instant growth in the early 2020s at what will truly be a great acquisition price based on the joint value-creation efforts underway between the companies. So with all these incredibly robust growth catalysts, we are in an excellent position for a successful march to $22 billion of revenue by 2022. In fact, we are so well positioned that we are now shifting our near-term emphasis from identifying and acquiring new growth catalysts to: First, continuing to execute the ones that we already have; and then second, focusing on margin rate accretion. For starters, we will leverage our $250 million cost-reduction program, which is substantially complete, as well as pricing and productivity benefits in 2019. Beyond that, we are now in the process of developing and executing an array of margin expansion initiatives, many of which are aided by applying modern technology such as elements of Industry 4.0 and advanced analytics. More to come at our investor meeting in May, but rest assured, this will be a powerful and substantial initiative that will generate future margin accretion and buffer our earnings and cash flow from the vagaries of economic cycles and the external operating environment. In addition, we have redirected our capital allocation in the short term to a deleveraging posture, keeping the balance sheet in a prudent place as is appropriate for this stage of the cycle. This will give us maximum flexibility in the future for opportunistic repurchases and for acquisitions as our long-term capital allocation strategy of 50% back to the shareholders and 50% reinvested in growth remains intact. So in summary, there's a lot to be excited about with this powerful growth story. And now adding the additional focus on margin expansion will ensure that the benefit of all this revenue growth makes its way into even higher growth rates for operating margin and EPS. And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan, who'll walk you through more detail in the segment performance, overall financial results and 2019 guidance. Don?
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the fourth quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 4% total revenue growth, with 7% organic growth and a 3-point headwind from currency. Organic growth included 5 points of volume and 2 points from price. We continue to see sequential improvement in our price realization, which represented a full quarter benefit from the price actions we executed during the third quarter. The operating margin rate for the segment was 15.4%, down from the prior year as benefits of volume leverage, pricing and cost control were more than offset by the impacts of currency, commodity inflation and tariffs. The impact of these headwinds amounted to $135 million for Stanley Black & Decker. Approximately 90% of this figure impacted Tools & Storage in the fourth quarter. The strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU. First, on a geographic basis, North America was up 10% organically with strong performances across all channels. U.S. retail and U.S. commercial markets both posted low double-digit growth, and our industrial and auto repair markets generated mid-single-digit growth. North America's growth continued to be fueled by new product innovations, including FLEXVOLT, the Craftsman brand rollout and price realization. The Craftsman rollout is continuing to be well-received by end-users and our customers. For the year, it drove close to 2 points of revenue for Tools & Storage, net cannibalization. We are excited and encouraged by the success we are seeing as we continue the rollout in 2019. More on that from Jeff a little bit later. Europe delivered 4% organic growth in the quarter. 9 out of 10 markets grew organically, an impressive performance as we did see some weaker market conditions in Europe. The team once again leveraged our strong portfolio of brands and expanded our retail relationships to produce above-market organic growth. Finally, emerging markets delivered 3% organic growth. Diligent price actions to offset currency headwinds, Lenox/Irwin revenue synergies as well as a continued focus on e-commerce and the ongoing MPP launch continued to support growth in this part of the Tools & Storage business. These actions were partially offset by severe market contractions that we saw in Argentina and Turkey. These two markets reduced growth by approximately 360 basis points, and that is not unexpected, given the recent foreign exchange volatility we've seen in those two countries. However, Latin America continued to be strong with double-digit growth. Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Chile and Mexico had high single-digit or double-digit organic performances. Additionally, in Russia, India, Korea and Taiwan, they all posted high single or double-digit organic growth as well. Now taking a look at the Tools & Storage SBUs. All lines showed high single-digit growth in the quarter. Power Tools & Equipment delivered 7% organic growth and benefited from new product introductions and strong commercial execution. FLEXVOLT delivered a robust mid-teen growth for the year while delivering improved profitability, which is now in line with the overall segment average. Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage delivered 8% organic growth as new product introductions, the continued Craftsman rollout and then solid performances within the construction and industrial-focused product lines, and of course, the contribution from Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, all these items contributing to their growth. In summary, an excellent quarter and a very successful year for the Tools & Storage organization with growth in every region. Operating margin for the quarter was strong at 15.4% as the benefits from volume leverage, pricing and cost control were more than offset by what we saw around the headwinds in currency, commodity and tariffs. This team continues to be resilient and is acting with agility to return this business back to margin expansion in 2019. Turning to Industrial. This segment delivered 14% total revenue growth, which included 12 points of growth from the Nelson Fastener acquisition and a negative 2 points from currency. Organic growth was 4%, and operating margin rate declined year-over-year to 13.2% as productivity gains and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation, the dilutive impact from the acquisition of Nelson Fasteners and then an unfavorable revenue mix within the fourth quarter. Engineered Fastening posted total growth of 14%, which included the contribution from Nelson Fasteners. Organic growth for Engineered Fastening was 1% due to higher system shipments and fastener penetration gains in the automotive business, which were partially offset by a decline in global light vehicle production. The latest global light vehicle production for full year 2018 shows a modest retraction versus the prior year. As demonstrated this year, our Fastener business can still grow in this environment as we increase the fastener content within our customers. For the year, our auto fastener growth was 6%, over 600 basis points ahead of global production. The Infrastructure businesses delivered robust growth, up 18% organically. This was primarily due to stronger North American Oil & Gas pipeline projects, which contributed an impressive 27% organic growth in the quarter. We also had modest growth within our Hydraulic Tool business. Finally, the Security segment declined 1% with bolt-on acquisitions contributing 3 points of growth, which was offset by an organic decline of 2% and unfavorable currency of 2%. North America declined 2% organically as higher volumes in automatic doors and health care were more than offset by lower installation revenues in commercial electronic security. Europe was down 2% organically as growth in Sweden was offset by weakness in the U.K. and France. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin expanded to 12%, improving 100 basis points versus the prior year. The Security team continues to make progress on the transformation plan, namely, optimizing our cost to serve while positioning the business to provide new and differentiated offerings to our large key account customers and to our small- to medium-sized accounts. This quarter and the second half demonstrated an important first step toward stabilizing the margin performance of this business by delivering operating margin dollars and rate improvement versus 2017. We expect these transformation initiatives to gain further traction in 2019 as we continue to position the business for meaningful margin dollar and rate expansion and more consistent organic revenue growth. In summary, it was another promising quarter for Security, with the team delivering year-over-year margin expansion for the first time since late 2016. Let's take a look at our free cash flow performance on the next page. I would like to highlight that we are presenting the 2017 cash flow amounts as previously reported and exclude the impacts of the new accounting standards that were adopted in January of 2018. We believe that presenting the cash flow results in this manner provides a more meaningful comparison of the company's operating cash flow performance. Similar to past years, we were able to drive significant working capital improvements during the quarter. Our full year free cash flow performance was solid as we generated $769 million in 2018. Cash from operations declined $158 million versus 2017, which was driven by higher tax payments due to the addition of the toll charge that was included within U.S. tax reform, and we also had higher M&A-related payments. We saw our capital expenditures increase by $49 million in 2018 as we made investments to expand our manufacturing and distribution capacity, made technology investments to support functional transformation and Industry 4.0 and invested to support our acquisition integrations. This performance resulted in free cash flow as a percentage of net income of approximately 119%. Excluding the noncash net charges associated with U.S. tax reform, free cash flow conversion was approximately 90%, in line with expected - expectations communicated in our October earnings call. From a working capital turn perspective, we delivered 8.8 turns in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 0.3 turns versus the prior year. This decline is primarily due to carrying higher levels of inventory to support the Craftsman rollout and, to a lesser extent, the dilutive impact from the acquisition of Nelson. Working capital management remains a key pillar of the SFS 2.0 operating system. We continue to drive working capital improvements across the company, with heavy focus on improving the performance of our recent acquisitions and eventually moderating the inventory levels from our tools, brands, transitions that are happening right now when we feel that's appropriate. We are confident in our ability to bring our working capital turns back above 10 in the coming years. Now let's move deeper into our 2019 guidance. We are targeting approximately 4% organic growth in 2019 with an adjusted earnings per share range of $8.45 to $8.65, up approximately 5% versus prior year at the midpoint. The free cash flow conversion will be approximately 85% to 90%. The free cash flow conversion is slightly below our historical performance and long-term targets due primarily to two factors: One, we are expecting that much of the cash payments associated with our Q4 2018 cost-reduction program will occur in 2019; the second factor is the ongoing cash payment associated with the total charge that we'll see for the next seven years. Over the long term, we are still confident that a conversion rate of approximately 100% is still achievable as we use our Core SFS principles to drive working capital out of the system. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to range from $7.45 to $7.65, which is inclusive of various onetime charges related to M&A as well as some onetime cost related to our margin enhancement initiative that Jim just discussed, also including the ongoing Security transformation. Turning to the drivers of core EPS growth. You can see on the left-hand side of the chart we expect the benefits from organic volume to generate $0.30 to $0.40 of EPS accretion. The cost-reduction program we executed at the end of 2018 is expected to deliver $1.05 of EPS, which is a net of a modest set of investments to support value-driving activities such as Industry 4.0, advanced analytics and our Security transformation. These items will be partially offset by $0.90 to $1 of incremental tariff, commodity inflation and currency headwinds, net of both carryover price benefits and new pricing actions implemented earlier this year in response to tariffs. We expect a tax rate of approximately 17.5%, which represents a $0.15 EPS headwind year-over-year. And then lastly, the benefits from the MTD partnership and the lower share count, partially offset by higher interest expense, should deliver a positive $0.10 in EPS. I would highlight that we have included Section 301 List 3 at a 10% assumption for the full year. If this does increase to 25%, it could represent a gross headwind of approximately $100 million before pricing and other mitigation efforts. As you read in the release and heard from Jim, we are preparing to take additional cost and margin-driving activities to insulate ourselves from this and other risks. Also, as you know, we always build a level of contingency to ensure that we can deliver our guidance and absorb a certain level of unknown market or external headwinds, and we will continue to do that in 2019. I would now like to review one other miscellaneous guidance matter. We expect the first quarter earnings to be approximately 13% of the full year performance. This is about 400 basis points lower than last year. The primary factor driving this lower percentage of full year delivery is that we continue to expect elevated levels of external headwinds, particularly in Tools, which from a profile perspective, are more heavily weighted towards the front half of the year. This will cause the first quarter to show operating margin rate and dollar retraction as we have a headwind of approximately $125 million to $135 million, net of pricing benefits, which is nearly 3/4 of the expected $170 million full year net headwind. Now turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. Organic growth within Tools & Storage is expected to be at mid-single digits in 2019. There are multiple catalysts supporting growth, including: Core innovation; continued benefits from FLEXVOLT; the Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies; emerging market opportunities; and the continued brand transitions with Craftsman, Stanley and Stanley FatMax. Margin rates are expected to be positive year-over-year. We are expecting the external environment to continue to be challenging in 2019, presenting another year of large external headwinds, as I just mentioned. However, we will continue to leverage multiple margin levers, including price realization, cost actions, margin-enhancing initiatives and volume to offset these headwinds and position the business for a return to margin expansion in 2019, with stronger performance expected for the second half. In the Industrial segment, we expect a relatively flat organic performance, reflecting softening conditions within the automotive end market. We're expecting Engineered Fastening to be relatively flat organically with continued growth within automotive fasteners. Our systems outlook reflects a softer year as we have been seeing a more constrained CapEx spending environment with our auto customers. In Oil & Gas, we are planning for low- to mid-single-digit growth, driven by stronger North American pipeline project activity. And then Hydraulic Tools growth will be relatively flat due to slower market conditions in that space. We expect operating margins to be flat year-over-year with productivity and cost actions offset by commodity inflation and tariffs in our Industrial segment. Finally, in the Security segment, we're expecting the organic growth to be up low single digits in 2019 as the team continues to execute its transformation strategy. This should translate into improved operating margins year-over-year as we continue to stabilize margins and deliver on our initiatives to lower our cost to serve. So in summary, 4% organic growth, 4% to 6% adjusted EPS expansion despite a 2-point tax headwind, a solid result and a balanced view that acknowledges the current market condition and today's view of the external headwinds, which are front-half loaded. We believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company for success in 2019 despite a very dynamic operating environment. We remain focused on our organic growth catalysts, margin expansion initiatives, strong free cash flow generation and successful acquisition integrations. With that, I will like to turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffery Ansell: Thank you, Don. I would like to provide a few more points on the Tools & Storage performance for the year, including updates on our strategic brand partnerships for Craftsman and Stanley. We closed 2018 with high single-digit organic growth enabled by record-setting new product launches, best-in-class commercial partnerships and integration excellence. As evidence, Irwin, Lenox and Waterloo have delivered double-digit organic growth since becoming part of Stanley Black & Decker. Adding to the strong acquisitive performance is Craftsman, which is exceeding both our and our customers' expectations. We're on track to $1 billion in revenue growth by 2021, 7 years ahead of schedule. This progress is being driven by strong user acceptance. As such, we have achieved a 4.6-star rating across well over 1,000 products and outstanding in-store execution by both Lowes and Ace. We also announced last quarter that the Home Depot will now be the exclusive home improvement retailer for Stanley and Stanley FatMax Hand Tools & Storage product portfolios, both in-store and online, beginning this year. The product will begin to ship in the front half of 2019. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim to wrap up today's presentation.
James Loree: Thank you, Jeff. In summary, 2018 was a year of solid performance despite the volatile external environment. As we said, we delivered 8% total revenue growth, including 5% organic; net OM rate remained robust at 13.6%; and adjusted EPS grew by 9%. Our teams acted with speed and agility while facing into and overcoming an unprecedented impact from currency, commodity and tariff headwinds. And while these headwinds will gradually abate as 2019 unfolds, they will be with us for a while, and the economic growth backdrop also looks to be slowing as well. So with that as context, we are pleased that our 2019 outlook calls for 4% organic growth with a 4% to 6% EPS expansion, and we feel good about that. We remain focused on delivering above-market organic growth with operating leverage, reenergizing our focus on margin expansion, continuing to successfully execute our recent acquisitions and generating strong free cash flow. And as always, our seasoned leadership team will act with agility and leverage SFS 2.0 and all available avenues to maximize our value creation for shareholders. In other news today, we are announcing that Stanley Black & Decker was named to the Carbon Disclosure A List for both climate change and water. This great recognition is an honor, and it underscores our commitment to continue to conduct ourselves in a socially responsible manner. I would like to thank my senior management team and all of our Stanley Black & Decker associates around the world as well as all our stakeholders, including the investment community, for your support. We are looking forward to another successful year in 2019 and continuing our pursuit of strong financial performance, pervasive innovation and social responsibility. Thank you. And with that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.
Richard Kwas: Jim, Don. First, on Jim, so focus on deleveraging here, kind of base level for capital deployment, doesn't seem like this is going to be a year of meaningful M&A. What would you characterize, given where we are in the cycle, of the puts and takes, consideration, in terms of additional M&A? And then, Don, real quick on the free cash flow conversion and the over - underlying conservatism in the guidance. If you could make some comments on conservatism. And then second, on FCF, is there any working capital headwind with regard to the transition of the Stanley brand to Home Depot?
James Loree: Okay. It's Jim, I'll start. At this point in the cycle, our plan is to kind of go in strong, stay strong and emerge stronger. And that's exactly what we did in '08, '09. If you recall, those that followed us for a long time. When we went into this, the cycle, we actually had our balance sheet in great shape and we continued to maintain as much operating margin and cash flows we could squeeze out of the company even though the revenues were down a little bit. And in '09, at the tail end of all that chaos, we actually negotiated the Black & Decker transaction and transformed the company subsequently. Now I'm not suggesting that we have any plans to do that, such a transaction, again. But what I will say is that it's really amazing when you come out of the end of the cycle and look at all the opportunities that are out there, large and small, that derived from others who had not maintained themselves in the same manner during that downward part of the cycle. So with that, debt-to-EBITDA right now is about 2.6x, and we are deleveraging this year. We may do 1 or 2 very small emerging market transactions, but that would be about it. And I'd say by the end of '19, we're going to be in really great shape from a balance sheet perspective. We are already, but even better shape, and then we'll see where we go from there.
Donald Allan: So to your second question, Rich, on free cash flow conversion for 2019 guidance. I mentioned the two items that are resulting us being in 85% to 90%, with one being the total charge and then the other being M&A or restructuring-related payments associated with the fourth quarter charge that we took of about $100 million. So most of that cash outflow will happen in 2019. On the working capital front, we don't actually see a dramatic improvement in working capital turns in 2019 because we do have to continue to work through these brand transitions that we've discussed throughout the last year related to Craftsman, but now also related to what's happening with Stanley and Stanley FatMax in the Home Depot. And we have to make sure that we have the right level of inventory to meet the needs of our customers. And we're not going to get overly aggressive in our supply chain until we work through those transitions. So we're not counting on a dramatic improvement in working capital turns in 2019. But as I mentioned, once we work through that, we can regulate and moderate to the levels that are more historical for us and begin to work our way back to 10 turns over the next few years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.
Timothy Wojs: I have a quick two-parter. I guess, first, could you just talk about within the Tools growth guidance, what is embedded in there in terms of accretion from Craftsman and the Stanley Hand Tool changes? And then secondly, I was just - the cadence of Q1 margins being lower, is the implication that Tools' margins be positive through the remainder of 2019? Just want to clarify that.
Donald Allan: Yes. So if you think about Tools & Storage organic growth, we said mid-single digits. So you interpret what that, but it can range anywhere from 4% to 6%. So it's probably leaning towards, closer to the high end of that range. Within there, we see Craftsman performance net of cannibalization. So when we talk Craftsman net of cannibalization, we're including the impacts of what's happening with Stanley and Stanley FatMax and Porter Cable coming out of Lowe's. We believe that impacts probably 2 to 3 points in 2019. And so that kind of gives you a gauge of where we think it is. So it's relatively close to what we experienced in 2018, maybe a little bit better. The second question was related to - what was the second question, Dennis?
Dennis Lange: First quarter margins.
Donald Allan: First quarter margins. So yes, what it does imply, as we look at the second, third and fourth quarter, we would expect to start to see, in the Tools business, margin rate and dollar expansion year-over-year. So the first - as I mentioned, a significant amount of that net headwind of $170 million, $125 million to $135 million is happening in the first quarter. So that's a dramatic impact to the first quarter, which makes sense, given the timing of the headwinds last year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeffrey Sprague: Jim, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what the kind of other margin enhancement actions you are taking. I assume those are above and beyond the Q4 restructuring. And then also, just maybe as a follow-on to that last question. It would seem you would still expect actual adjusted EPS to probably be down on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. Is that correct?
James Loree: You take the second part.
Donald Allan: Okay, yes. Yes it's not true, Jeff. We actually expect adjusted EPS to grow because we do have a low tax rate again in the second quarter, and we had one last year, so that's - it's a bit of a headwind, but it's not a significant headwind. And we do expect OM dollars to grow year-over-year.
James Loree: Okay. And on the margin enhancements, I'll give you a little appetizer. I think the main course, we'll serve up at the Analyst Meeting. But essentially, we've - as soon as we completed the work in the fourth quarter on the cost takeout, the near-term cost takeout, we said to ourselves, "Our margins are under attack from these headwinds. We need to get back what we've lost already, so that $250 million will help. But what if we get more of the same? What if we, the down - what if we go into a downturn in back half of '19 or in '20?" And so we said, "We really need to basically create some protection for, call them black swans or economic cyclical aspects." And also, our objective here is to grow our operating margins by 50 basis points a year. Obviously, that didn't happen in 2018, and we're committed to do that. So we need a way to get there. And we thought about this, and we said, "22/22, we're two years in. We've done enough deals now, and they're - every one of them is a deal that we'd do over again if we could. We love these deals. We've done enough so that we can actually see our way pretty much to 22/22 from a revenue point of view. Now let's figure out how we can make sure that we get the margin to go with it to create operating leverage so that we really get that double benefit of lots of revenue growth and margin expansion at the same time." And so we've been working a lot on different elements of digital technology and how that can be used to create value in our company, both from a value proposition point of view, in our products, in our business models, but also in our functional processes and so on. And it really occurred to us that if we could accelerate many of these things that we're working on and put some serious, accelerated focus on them, that - we started adding up the benefits from these various initiatives, like Industry 4.0, advanced analytics, Procurement 2.0 and indirect cost management, the technologies that exist today, to use analytics to really do those in a - manage those various topics in a much more efficient manner is really compelling. And so we've been experimenting with some of that, and we feel confident now that we have something that can generate hundreds of millions of dollars of benefit over a 2 to 3 year period. And we'll figure out what the exact amount is, and we'll share that with you in May. But it's a very large number and it's a very focused initiative. We're going to run it like an acquisition integration, with governance. And like I said earlier, we're going to focus on executing the growth initiatives that we already have and we're going to focus on margin expansion. And I think the combination of those two things is going to be incredibly powerful.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.
Julian Mitchell: Maybe just a quick update on what the sort of delta is in your earnings guidance versus previously the commentary around high single-digit growth. Is it simply about a point or so less volume growth assumption? Or has anything changed in terms of your confidence around pricing initiatives, particularly in Tools?
Donald Allan: Yes, I would say that there's certainly a point difference in growth, as you mentioned, versus just looking at the markets as they play out in the fourth quarter, and the view of U.S. housing and the automotive space for production just feels like there's still growth there, but it's slowing. So that's certainly one factor. We do have a little bit bigger tax headwind as well because we did come in lower for 2018. So that's a little bit of a headwind in addition. And then the third thing is we need to continue to monitor the impact of all the price in the markets. And like we said in October, we're putting a fair amount of price actions into the market. We're going to manage this both looking at what's the right thing to do for price and what's the right action to ensure we have the right level of volume. And we're going to manage those in concert with each other to achieve the right outcomes. So as we continue to do that, there will be a little bit of pressure probably in the margin rate versus previous expectations, and we saw that play out in the fourth quarter. But those are really the three main factors.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut: Just a little bit more detail, if possible, around some of the moving pieces of '19 guidance. And obviously, appreciate all the help so far. First, on the margin - I'm sorry, quarterly cadence, with the biggest hit of the commodity inflation being in the first quarter, are we to understand that the reason you have the confidence that you'll switch to operating margin positive in the remaining quarters is because of the cost actions that have already been put in place? Or is there some amount of price realization as well that you're still expecting? And secondly, also on the deleveraging, how are we to think of share buyback for '19 when you talk about the benefit that you expect from lower shares? Is that just the flow-through from what you've done in '18? Or is there anything incremental in '19?
Donald Allan: Yes. So the cadence of the quarter is - clearly, the biggest impact in the second quarter is going to be the headwinds going down dramatically year-over-year as we begin to annualize those headwinds in the second quarter. If you remember, in 2018, we certainly vividly remember the timing of all this. But as we went into March and April, we began to see commodity prices increase. We got into May and we saw FX shift dramatically. And in then June, we saw tariffs come onto the scene. So in the second quarter, we saw significant ramp-up of the headwinds, and that continued into the third quarter. So as we get to the end of the second quarter and into July, we will have comped a lot of those headwinds. And so you look at that aspect and then you look at the impact of the cost reductions, which the impact is relatively even across the four quarters, and so it's about $60 million per year - per quarter, I'm sorry. And therefore, you got that impact, combined with a lower level of headwinds year-over-year because of that comp issue is really why we believe we can grow our operating margin in the second quarter.
James Loree: And also the fact that the pricing actions are kind of accumulating over time and getting bigger every quarter sequentially. And so that has a benefit, too, especially as we get into second quarter of 2019.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: Just want to just unpackage your outlook for 4% to 6%, so let's call it 5% Tools & Storage growth in '19. Roughly, how does that shake out between North America, Europe, rest of the world? And what would your estimate be for market growth in North America in '19?
Jeffery Ansell: I think the actual range Don provided was probably 4% to 6%, said it was probably going to be a little bit on the - more towards the high side of that. So I think that's what we're looking at for the - over the course of '19. And I think you'll see that we're absolutely committed to growth in all markets. So you look at growth, we'll have growth in North America, we'll have growth in Europe, we'll have growth in the global emerging markets consistent with what we had this year. Of those 3, probably, the leading growth contender will be North America as it was in '18. But we're getting growth in both of those other places as well. And we think with that estimate, we'll grow above the market, therefore, representing market share gain again in 2019, consistent with what we had in '18.
James Loree: Yes. And I think we all know that the European economy had slowed quite a bit. Germany went negative, the U.K. is in chaos and confusion with Brexit, Italy is a disaster. And despite all that, our European outlook for Tools is going to decent, it'll be probably 2% to 4% kind of growth. So it's still continuing to forge ahead in Europe. And then emerging markets, we have some specific markets that are challenged right now, as almost - as we almost always do. I think in this case, Turkey is tough, Argentina is really difficult. And we had major currency devaluations in those markets, but also just the economies themselves are really difficult. So we might see a little bit slower growth in emerging markets this year than we did last year. But still, we're going to be significantly positive, and we'll be running at least 3x higher than the overall market growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Crédit Suisse.
Susan Maklari: I just wanted to get a little bit more color on what you're thinking in terms of some of the commodity inputs. We've seen some of those pull back in the later parts of 2018. What's embedded in the forecast from that perspective for 2019?
Donald Allan: Yes. So I talked about net headwinds of $170 million. If you break that down a little bit, the gross headwind is about $320 million and you have an offsetting price impact of $150 million. Of that $320 million, approximately 1/2 of that is commodity inflation, so it's a significant number. We have seen positive trends around certain commodities, for sure. But we do have to remember that a lot of the commodities that we get are really engineering-grade commodities, and we haven't seen as much of a movement in those commodities versus some other more straightforward commodities, in steel in particular. So we've seen a little bit of benefit since December. And as we continue to look at this, it may continue to trend in the right direction, and it could result in an opportunity for us as the year goes on. But at this stage, we actually have not seen a dramatic movement in the commodities that we buy because we tend to buy at the higher end of the grades. And as a result, that hasn't moved as much as some of the other commodities. But the trends are positive, which we feel good about right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Just a question on the bridge. I know that there's kind of a lot of moving parts here, and maybe with the outstanding numbers from 3Q, could use a little bit of an update. I guess the real delta here would seem that a normal organic growth, if the right number is kind of a 20% incremental margin, you guys seem to be closer to 10%. And there looks like there's been, at least on the surface, some slippage in that $250 million of cost reduction, and a lot of that soaks up the relief that you've gotten on tariffs or baking in List 3 at 10%. Is that kind of the rough math of it? Because, I guess, both of those numbers, both the headwind and the tailwind, seemed a little bit lower than what I would have thought on the surface just to start out.
Donald Allan: Yes, I think on the leverage front, you probably have to really look at it on a volume basis versus total organic. So if you look at volume, you can use an assumption like 20%, 25%. That kind of gets you to the numbers that we're talking about. And then there's a separate price benefit that's netted in the headwinds that we've laid out for guidance and for actual results. Because we really dissected that because pricing can kind of mute the leverage numbers or change the leverage numbers quite a bit. And as a result, you're better off looking at them in those separate categories.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.
Nicole DeBlase: So I guess just a couple. One is kind of a box-ticking item. On the margin enhancement initiatives, could that possibly give upside to second half with respect to payback? Or is that more of a 2020 payback? And then if you could just talk about the impact of what's going on at Sears on your Craftsman rollout expectations.
James Loree: Okay. Well, it's Jim. I'll have Jeff handle the second question. And on the margin enhancement initiative, the benefit that we're going to see from that is going to be recognized over a 2 to 3 year period. We're going to do everything we can. We're going to work really hard to try to bring some benefit into 2019 as an insurance policy. And it's not clear that it's going to be a huge number. But I think it's - there's probably something there, and we'll go after it.
Jeffery Ansell: Regarding the question relative to Sears. I think it's really, based on everything that has just occurred in the last two weeks, you'd say it's very much business as usual. If you look at the trend over the last, at least 36 months, that company would typically announce a closure plan following holiday sales, and that would be updated over the course of the year to include more and more stores. This year, it's not much different. So the fact that those stores will remain in operation at a lower count than the prior year, et cetera, is very consistent with what's happened in the prior years. So we expect that our Craftsman rollout will continue to take share as that presence atrophies in the marketplace. So not that different than any other prior year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet.
Michael Wood: If we take into account Craftsman accretion to growth and what - where we think you're running at for price, it seems like there's not much organic growth outside of Craftsman in Tools & Storage volumes. You seem to be tracking well above that currently, so I'm curious what is explaining the deceleration in that lack - in the business ex Craftsman. And does that concern you?
James Loree: Well, I think that we try to make it very clear that the economic backdrop is one of slowing growth, it's nothing to do with our market share. Our market share continues to outperform the market. And I think the reality is setting in, hopefully not just us, but most industrial companies are facing slower economic growth in the United States, in China, in pretty much most parts of Europe and the emerging markets. I mean, essentially the whole world except for a few bright spots like India, for example. But the reality is that economic growth that we see for 2019, and - is pretty - is probably a good point lower than it has been in the recent couple of years. And then on top of that, it's no secret that the construction markets in the United States have slowed as well. So baked into our guidance is a reality check on the slowing markets. It's not catastrophic. It's nothing that we can't handle. But our long-term growth objectives are 4% to 6%. We're putting 4% out there at a time when economic growth is slowing. Makes perfect sense to me.
Donald Allan: Yes. And at the end of the day, we think that's the right thing to do for all the reasons that Jim articulated. But any chance we're wrong, the markets are a little better, then we'll all be happy. But this is the right approach, given the signals that we've seen in housing, the signals that we've seen in the automotive production space. They're all showing growth for the most part except for auto production. Looks like it's going to be down next year. But they're slowing, and we have to be realistic about what the trends are right now.
Jeffery Ansell: Maybe one last addition would be if you look at 2018, our growth was 6% to 7% in Tools in a market that grew slower than that. That market, we think, is going to be compressed by about a point this coming year, and our growth looks pretty similar to that, 5% to 6%. So our growth rates will still be accretive to market growth although the market's growing just a little bit slower. That's kind of it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
Joseph Ritchie: Just maybe following up on that a little bit, Jim, and the slowing that you saw - that you're expecting to see in the U.S. I mean, Tools & Storage still put up 10% organic in North America. And so can you talk about whether you started to see slowing in 4Q as the quarter progressed? And then I guess my second question for Don, in talking through that $250 million cost benefit number, did you recognize any of that in 2018? And what's the cadence of that number as we progress through 2019?
James Loree: Okay. I'll take the first part. The slowing in the tools market, I think, started in the third quarter, concurrent with the interest rates increases that were being implemented by the Fed. And we saw the same thing in automotive as well, the interest rate sensitive type markets, housing, automotive, impacted by rising interest rates. And it continued in the fourth quarter. We were thinking, well, maybe it's an anomaly in the third quarter. Sometimes, you get those for a couple of months or a couple - yes, a couple of months. And it really did continue into the fourth quarter, pretty steady in the sense that it didn't get worse, it's just kind of felt a little bit more anemic in the third quarter and fourth quarter than it did in the beginning - of the first half of the year.
Donald Allan: And on the cost takeout side, we did get a modest benefit in the fourth quarter just because some of them were implemented through the November time frame, but it wasn't significant. And the cadence is really, as I mentioned earlier, pretty equal across the year. So it's roughly $60 million to $65 million per quarter.
Jeffery Ansell: Maybe one other addition to what Jim just highlighted is that we said for '18, that North America outpaced Europe and global emerging markets. That is also true for '19. And in that, retail - North American retail and North American commercial, therefore, will be accretive to the overall rates we just described. So it's very consistent with 2018.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman & Associates.
Justin Speer: I had a couple of questions, first being on channel inventories across your core end markets and your customers. Was there any pull-ahead risk, particularly in slowing traffic and some of these customers that we're seeing? Any potential pull-forward risk into the quarter from tariff-related price increases in your core Tools businesses?
Donald Allan: Yes. I wouldn't say - we don't really know if anybody pulled anything ahead for tariff reasons. So our customers don't necessarily tell us that they're doing those types of things. I would say that the inventory levels did modestly increase as we exited the year versus the previous year end, but frankly, they're not significant. It's not something that we view as a major concern as we go into the first quarter and the year.
Jeffery Ansell: Maybe additionally, the POS, as we exited the holiday season continued to be quite strong. So what Don described was we did have a little bit of inventory build in the course of the quarter. Most of that was gone by the end of the year, very, very consistent with where we wanted to be at the end of the year and where we ended last year. Secondly, in terms of pull-forwards, the retailers and so forth have gotten so sophisticated, system-driven, that there's very little pull-ahead these days when you announce pricing. So that was not a big impact to the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Barry with the Buckingham.
Robert Barry: Just a couple of things. One is a follow-up on an earlier question on commodity. Did that headwind actually go up versus that 3Q? Because I thought it was $100 million. Now you said - I think you said 50% of $320 million. And then on the tariffs. Is that now, in the walk, $100 million headwind? I'm just curious to the extent to which the change in the value of the renminbi might actually be able to help you offset that.
Donald Allan: Yes, the commodity number has gone up primarily because of just some accounting dynamics on how certain things get accounted for. There's a number that's kind of hung up in inventory as we go into this year that will impact the numbers. So it's up by $40 million to $50 million versus maybe what we were thinking in the middle of last year primarily because of that dynamic. And the other thing is on the tariff side, yes, that number is correct, incremental $100 million year-over-year.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me for any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Dennis Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third quarter 2018 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 11:30 AM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don and Jeff will review our third quarter 2018 results and other various matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risks and uncertainty. It's, therefore, possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 1934 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw in our release, we delivered a strong third quarter in the face of some very difficult external headwinds. The company posted above-market organic revenue growth and 6% EPS expansion, overcoming approximately $135 million of currency commodity and tariff-related pressures. Revenues were $3.5 billion, up 4%, with organic growth of 4% and acquisitions adding 2 points of growth, which was offset by a 2-point currency headwind. Tools & Storage was the vanguard, pressing ahead with all major geographies and business units, contributing to a robust 6% organic growth. Tools leveraged our strong portfolio of organic catalysts to deliver this above-market growth. Price added 1 point to the growth and realization expanded 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting benefit from our third quarter list price increases, and Don Allan will provide some more color on this in his remarks. Industrial delivered 10% total growth with the Nelson Fastener acquisition contributing 11 points, partially offset by 1 point of unfavorable currency. Organic growth was flat as solid performances within Engineered Fastening and hydraulics were offset by expected declines in Oil & Gas. Engineered Fastening delivered strong fastener penetration within automotive and industrial, which more than offset the expected volume declines in Engineered Fastening's automotive systems. It is important to note that that systems volume is highly correlated to new car platforms and 2018, as expected, has been unusually light for these platforms. With that being said, our win rate on new vehicle production lines is very high, so this weakness will take care of itself in 2019 and beyond. Security delivered total growth of 1% as bolt-on acquisitions and price offset currency and modest volume declines. The Security team is fully engaged now in executing its transformational plan, and we are encouraged by the clarity of the vision and the sense of urgency. We believe we are making sustainable changes that will position this business for consistent revenue growth and margin expansion. EPS for the quarter was $2.08, up 6% as price, cost control and volume leverage offset the significant impact from commodity inflation, currency and tariffs. Consistent with our long-term capital allocation strategy, we completed a $300 million share repurchase during the quarter and announced the IES attachments and MTD Products transactions. This reflects our balanced approach to capital deployment by executing strategic M&A opportunities, adding growth catalysts to the portfolio, while concurrently repurchasing shares. And as we look ahead to 2019, our view now contemplates a significant carryover impact from these external headwinds, including commodity inflation, currency and tariffs, as well as a somewhat slower U.S. residential housing and automotive markets related to continued upward pressure on U.S. short-term interest rates. And as such, we will be executing a cost reduction program to deliver approximately $250 million of pre-tax savings in 2019. Our seasoned, capable management team will continue to address these external issues with price recovery actions and adjustments to our supply chain. In addition, we believe these additional cost measures are required to preserve our ability to deliver respectable earnings growth and cash flow next year. Our company has been on and continues to enjoy an excellent growth trajectory, and we will not allow these external impacts to erode the financial benefits from these catalysts, nor cast a cloud over this outstanding growth story. And while the short-term external environment has become more difficult, our long-term strategy and approach to capital allocation remains intact. We are well positioned with multiple company-specific growth drivers, which will buffer the revenue impact from slower end markets and provide for relative outperformance. Craftsman is compelling growth program that has begun its rollout at Lowe's. The exciting news today is that we now expect to achieve our $1 billion Craftsman growth target by 2021, six years ahead of our prior expectations. That means this $1 billion target within four years is about 60% sooner than the 10 years originally anticipated. In another piece of great news today, we announced an exclusive partnership for the STANLEY and the STANLEY FATMAX brands jointly with The Home Depot. This important win represents an exciting growth opportunity that will begin next year. These announcements underscore the very healthy commercial relationships that we share with both of our tremendous U.S. home center partners as well as all of our retail partners around the globe. They also highlight the inherent strategic advantages associated with our powerful brand portfolio. More on that when Jeff speaks in a few minutes. Across both emerging markets and developed markets, e-commerce remains a key commercial driver, which this year represents a $1 billion high-growth business for us, up from almost nothing in 2010. We are the global industry leader in this channel, which is an excellent source of high-double digit growth and will continue for years to come. In the emerging markets, we continue to enjoy double-digit growth and share gain. We are leveraging the strength of our brands, business model and coordinated product offerings across the developing markets, including STANLEY-branded mid-price point corded and cordless power tools, as well as hand tool products. We continue to enjoy success, growing at two times to three times market growth rates. And as for the Newell Tools acquisition, we expect to deliver $100 million to $150 million of organic growth from revenue synergies as we broaden the distribution of these products around the world. Our innovation machine continues to be alive and well. We are seeing continued revenue benefits from FLEXVOLT, and expect to generate growth from other new innovations as our past investments are bearing fruit. Finally, we expect to generate inorganic growth from the IES transaction in 2019, and we are excited about the future benefits from our transaction with MTD, which gives us an option to buy the remaining 80% of the greater than $2 billion lawn and garden company in 2021 and beyond. These catalysts will continue to support share gain in the markets we serve as we continue to work to generate new catalysts, leveraging the SFS 2.0 operating system and through a future capital deployment. So, in summary, there's a lot to be excited about with this powerful growth story, even as we make some very prudent supply chain and cost structure adjustments to ensure the benefit of all this revenue growth makes its way into operating margin and EPS. And now, I will turn it over to Don Allan, who will walk you through more detail on segment performance, overall financial results, and 2018 guidance. Don?
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the third quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 3% revenue growth, with a strong 6% organic growth, which was offset by 3 points of currency. Organic growth comprised a volume of slightly less than 5 points, while price was just above 1 point. More specifically, price realization actions taken in response to external headwinds contributed 1.3 points of organic growth, expanding 50 basis points from the second quarter. We continue to execute and realize our list price actions in accordance with our prior expectations, and we expect that this list price contribution will grow again in the fourth quarter. We should keep in mind that overall pricing impact is not a science and it requires judgment as the team balances many factors such as buying behavior, mix of products, when and where the purchase occurs, or if it is purchased on promotion. Our Tools & Storage business continues to operate with a dual objective to deliver above-market share volume growth and strive to project our margin rate. If you look at the margin rate results for Tools & Storage in the third quarter, the net effect of this was slightly better than expectation, showing the team is managing this dynamic very effectively. With that said, the operating margin rate for Tools & Storage was 16.6% versus 17.3% in the third quarter 2017 as benefits of volume leverage, pricing, and cost control were more than offset by the impacts from these headwinds we've described of currency, commodity inflation and tariffs. The strong organic growth and related share gains are experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU. On a geographic basis, North America was up 6% organically with growth across all channels. U.S. retail generated mid-single-digit growth, U.S. commercial markets posted high-single-digit growth, and our industrial and automotive repair markets generated mid-single-digit growth. North America's growth continued to be fueled by new product innovations including FLEXVOLT, the Craftsman brand rollout, and price realizations. We did see some higher-than-expected negative volume impacts from our Craftsman brand transition specifically related to our legacy brands. This being said, Craftsman was still a major growth driver for the quarter and net of this transition impact, and will continue to deliver growth for the foreseeable future. Europe delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter. Eight of the 10 markets grew organically with above-average contributions from France, Central Europe, Greece and Iberia. In the UK, we did experience some market pressure, which we believe is related to Brexit uncertainty and negative volume impacts related to targeted customer transitions within the UK. This contributed approximately 3 points of pressure versus our expectation for this region. Overall, the team continues to deliver new product innovations and expand retail relationships to produce above-market organic growth. Finally, emerging markets continued their trend of outstanding organic growth up 10%, with all regions contributing. Diligent pricing actions topped with increased currency headwinds, and continued focus on e-commerce and the ongoing MPP launch continued to support this growth. Geographically, Latin America was very strong headlined by mid-teen organic growth within Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico, leading with high-single-digit or double-digit-organic performance. With regard to other emerging markets outside of Latin America, we posted double-digit growth in Russia, Korea, Taiwan and India. Now, let's turn to the performance of Tools & Storage SBUs, starting with Power Tools & Equipment, which delivered 8% organic growth. Power Tools & Equipment benefited from new product introductions, and FLEXVOLT delivered robust growth once again and is now tracking at mid-teens growth year-to-date. FLEXVOLT growth continues to be led by increased penetration of the system and the new product launches within that category. Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage delivered 4% organic growth as new product introductions, solid performances within the construction- and industrial-focused product lines, as well as the contribution from Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies. So, in summary, a strong quarter for the Tools & Storage organization with growth in every region as the team executes on the exciting portfolio of growth initiatives that Jim covered earlier. Margins remained solid and 16.6% as the team pursued growth, cost control, and price increases to recover the headwinds from currency, cost inflation and tariffs. While the external environment remains volatile, this team continues to act with agility and is focused on positioning the business for further growth. Now, turning to Industrial, this segment delivered 10% total revenue growth with the Nelson Fastener acquisition and contributing 11 points, offset by 1 point of currency. Organic growth was flat, but in line with expectations. Operating margin rate declined year-over-year to 16.8% as productivity gains and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation and the modestly diluted impact from the acquisition of Nelson Fasteners. Within Industrial, Engineered Fastening posted total growth of 15%, with the acquisition of Nelson Fasteners leading the way. Organic growth was 1% during the quarter as strong industrial and automotive fasteners growth more than offset the expected declines in automotive systems due to lower model rollover activity from our customers. The Nelson integration remains on track to plan, and the business is demonstrating pro forma organic growth supported by new applications in aerospace, defense and infrastructure. All in all, a solid quarter for Engineered Fastening. The Infrastructure business has posted an organic decline of 6% for the quarter. Hydraulic tools posted low-single-digit growth as it continued to see the benefits from successful commercial actions. Meanwhile Oil & Gas posted high-single-digit organic decline in the quarter, as expected, given the lower pipeline project activity versus the prior year. Then finally, the Security segment demonstrated total growth of 1%, with flat organic growth in the third quarter. North America growth was down 1% organically as higher automatic door volumes were more than offset by lower volume in commercial electronic security. Europe organic growth was flat as strength in the Nordics was offset by weakness in France and in the UK. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin rate expanded to 11.1%, improving 110 basis points sequentially, but down 20 basis points year-over-year. The Security team is working diligently to optimize our cost to serve, while positioning the business to provide new and differentiated offerings to our large key account customers and our small- to medium-sized accounts. We expect as these initiatives gain further traction as we head into 2019, it will set up the business for more consistent organic revenue growth with meaningful margin expansion. It was promising this quarter to see the business stabilize operating margin dollars versus the prior year and improve the rates sequentially. I would now like to take a few minutes to provide an update on the potential impact of the Sears bankruptcy filing that occurred on Monday, October 15, as we've heard several questions from many of you. In terms of commercial exposure, we sell approximately $50 million annually to Sears Holdings, so a small exposure for the company. As it relates to the Craftsman brand transaction, our future payment obligations associated with the purchase of the Craftsman brand remain unchanged. One, we will make a onetime payment of $250 million in March of 2020. Two, beginning also in March of 2020, we will begin making quarterly royalty payments for all-new Stanley Black & Decker-generated Craftsman sales. Number three, the royalty-free license agreement that is currently in place allows Sears to develop and sell the Craftsman brand within Sears Holding stores. And then, four, as we've said in the past, we will honor valid warranty claims for Craftsman products as it is an important aspect of the brand and the right thing to do. On items one through three, these arrangements which currently remain in place and they are legally binding. Should Sears enter liquidation legal proceedings, the obligations under items one and two will remain. For items three and four, there would be a net onetime non-cash gain recognized within our results when this occurs. In other words, the deferred revenue liability recorded for the royalty-free license would be reversed into the P&L, and that would be partially offset by an increase to our warranty reserve due to higher historical exposure we would now have. As you look ahead, the most important aspect of all this is we believe the potential impacts from a smaller Sears clearly would be a positive for our ongoing Craftsman launch. Now, let's turn to the right side of the chart because I'd like to comment briefly on tariffs. Now that List 3 of section 301 tariffs is in effect at a 10% rate currently and will increase to a 25% rate in January of 2019, the annual impact of Lists 1 through 3 would be approximately $250 million, which is a $200 million increase versus 2018. Items carrying a tariff at this point represent approximately two-thirds of our imports from China. About 90% of this impact is composed of finished goods. Some key categories including mechanics tools, power tool accessories, vacuums and some hand tools. We expect to continue to get pricing associated with tariffs, and our price increases for List 3 will be implemented in January of 2019. Should a List 4 be put into effect covering all remaining imported products from China and, again, assuming a 25% tariff, this would represent another $125 million to $150 million of additional annualized risk before mitigation. It is important to note that if this situation occurs, we believe we are favorably positioned versus competition as approximately 50% of our North American sales are supported by tools production from North American facilities. From a tariff mitigation standpoint, we are acting first with price increases as well as using the exclusion process when available. We have had success already in mitigating some of this impact through leveraging our supply chain and receiving exemptions from the U.S. government. We now have become more aggressive in planning and executing supply chain moves to mitigate tariff impacts. We have been preparing this plan since the tariff discussion hit the radar earlier this year. We continue to evaluate the capital requirements and the respective returns on these investments. This dynamic environment creates the need for agility, and also is an opportunity to more aggressively localize production and expand on our make where we sell strategy. We will begin aggressively accelerating this strategy as we move into 2019. Now, turning to an update on our 2018 guidance. We are revising our 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $8.10 up to $8.20 from the previous range of $8.30 to $8.50. This revised EPS midpoint represents an increase of approximately 9% versus prior year, while overcoming $370 million in external headwinds versus the prior year. On a GAAP basis, we now expect an earnings per share range of $5.90 to $6.00 from the previous range of $7 to $7.20. The largest factor impacting the change in GAAP guidance is the restructuring charges associated with the cost reduction program discussed by Jim earlier. We are being proactive and focused on counteracting these external headwinds for 2019. Therefore, we are taking action to adjust our cost base and implementing a cost reduction program to deliver $250 million in annual cost savings in 2019. The pre-tax restructuring charge is expected to be approximately $125 million and is anticipated to be booked in the fourth quarter of 2018. Now, diving into a little more detail on our 2018 adjusted EPS outlook. You can see on the left-hand side of the chart, we expect higher input costs associated with tariffs, currency and commodities, as well as slightly lower expected organic growth, which will decrease earnings per share by $0.25 and $0.15, respectively. Partially offsetting these headwinds, we expect benefits from an anticipated lower tax rate and other below-the-line items to generate approximately $0.15 of EPS accretion. Now, turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. Organic growth expectation within Tools & Storage remains at high-single digits in 2018. The team is focused on key initiatives, including the rollout of the Craftsman brand, FLEXVOLT, Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, e-commerce and emerging markets, and is delivering strong growth in 2018 as a result. We expect the segment margin performance to be down year-over-year given primarily due to the elevated currency, commodity and tariff headwinds, which were partially offset by list price increases and cost containment actions. As it relates to Industrial and Security, there's no change from our 2018 guidance view we provided in July. Next, I would like to provide an update on our free cash flow performance and outlook. For the third quarter, free cash flow was $82 million, which brings our year-to-date performance to a use of cash of $287 million. The quarterly and year-to-date declines versus the prior year are explained by higher M&A-related restructuring and other payments, as well as higher working capital pressure from our ongoing Craftsman launch. We are confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation in the fourth quarter given our core SFS processes and principles, combined with reducing working capital levels in line with normal seasonal activity. We are, however, revising our outlook to deliver a free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 90%. This recognizes our expectation to carry higher inventory due to continued growth in the business and the ongoing Craftsman rollout. Also, we expect higher M&A-related payments this year versus previous expectation in January. The last comment I have related to this page is as it relates to our view for 2019. This view now contemplates a significant carryover impact from external headwinds such as commodity inflation, currency and tariffs, as well as a potentially slower U.S. residential housing and automotive market related to the continued upward pressure on U.S. short-term interest rates. As we've said, we are being proactive and focused on counteracting these external headwinds for 2019, which, at this stage, will be similar in size to the $370 million headwind we are experiencing in 2018. Therefore, we are taking action to adjust our cost base and implementing a cost reduction program to deliver $250 million in annual cost savings in 2019. This cost reduction program, along with our continued focus on price realization, is expected to exceed these external headwinds so we can deliver a meaningful net positive heading into next year. Therefore, we believe with the 2019 environment, which has a reasonable level of market growth, our earnings will grow high-single digits versus 2018. So, in summary, we believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company to deliver a solid 6% organic growth with 9% adjusted EPS expansion, again overcoming approximately $370 million in commodity inflation, tariffs and currency pressures. This performance is quite impressive given the magnitude of these headwinds. The organization remains focused on free cash flow generation, price realization, productivity and cost management, as well as acquisition integrations and the rollout of the Craftsman brand. We are focused on executing on our proactive cost reduction response, which will ensure the business is well positioned to deliver sustained above-market organic growth with earnings expansion in 2019. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff to say a few words about Craftsman and our exciting new commercial agreement with The Home Depot.
Jeffery D. Ansell - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you, Don. I'd like to make a few key points related to the Craftsman rollout, and as Jim referenced earlier, announce a new partnership for our STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX brands. We continue to generate share gains around the world as evidenced by high-single digit organic growth demonstrated year-to-date, with growth in every strategic business unit and every geography. This is being delivered as we execute the biggest and most exciting Craftsman product launch in modern history. Craftsman achieved strong growth in the quarter following the successful launch of 1,200 new products, including many that are manufactured in the United States with global materials for the first time in decades. As planned, Lowe's and Ace have begun rolling out new Craftsman offerings, which will continue in Q4 through completion in 2019. Amazon has built strong customer excitement for the launch of our metal storage range in Q4, with a broader rollout to continue throughout 2019. Initial feedback from the Craftsman rollout shows that we are converting new users to the Craftsman brand, which is a share gain opportunity for both our retail partners and us. The end user feedback has been exceptionally positive with top-quartile product review ratings. The end user and customer enthusiasm, coupled with the recent Sears bankruptcy announcement, gives us confidence that we can deliver $1 billion in Craftsman growth by 2021, as Jim said, six full years ahead of schedule. I'd shift now to an exciting update on our partnership with The Home Depot. Today, we've announced that The Home Depot will be the exclusive home improvement retailer for the STANLEY Hand Tools & Storage product portfolio, both in-store and online beginning in 2019. Also included in this exclusive offering is the STANLEY FATMAX product line, the world's leading tape measure brand known for innovation and durability. This agreement represents one of the largest exclusivity partnerships in the tools and storage industry, enhancing our robust offering at The Home Depot with existing exclusives in DEWALT FLEXVOLT cordless tools and DEWALT hand tools. We're excited to expand our partnership and provide both pro and DIY consumers with unparalleled access to the STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX portfolios. This agreement is an example of our business' commitment to commercial excellence, a representation of the vision we have for our portfolio of iconic brands across the retail landscape. Our strategic brand partnerships with industry-leading retailers are designed to best serve our customers and end users in the U.S. and across the globe. Now, I turn it back to Jim to wrap today's presentation.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Jeff, thanks for sharing those exciting developments regarding our partners and the Craftsman STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX brands. It's encouraging to see how we are building upon our strong customer partnerships and realizing new opportunities for growth. It's also rewarding to be able to officially update our projection for Craftsman to deliver $1 billion of growth by 2021. So moving to the third quarter, to summarize, we delivered a solid performance of 4% organic growth and 6% EPS expansion, overcoming $135 million in currency, commodity and tariff headwinds. Our teams remain focused on price execution and cost control in response to the external pressures which have now grown to $370 million for 2018 as Don mentioned. And despite these headwinds, we are expected to deliver strong financial performance with 6% organic growth and 9% EPS expansion for the full year 2018. This is a testament to the speed and agility of our team and the strength of our SFS 2.0 operating system that we are in this position today. And as you heard earlier, we are building into our planning, a continuation of this dynamic and volatile macroenvironment, and announced a cost reduction program targeted to deliver $250 million in annual savings for 2019. This will prepare the business for respectable earnings growth and cash flow next year in spite of the carryover headwinds. And as we look to close out 2018, we are focused on execution and operational excellence. This includes generating revenue growth with operating leverage, delivering on pricing, productivity, and cost actions, and successfully integrating our recent acquisitions while generating strong free cash flow. I'm confident that we will be successful in navigating these near-term headwinds and remain optimistic about the outlook for our company-specific growth initiatives, which will buffer the revenue impact from slower end markets and provide for earnings growth and relative outperformance. And just to reiterate, these catalysts include the accelerating Craftsman rollout, a new exclusive STANLEY, STANLEY FATMAX partnership at Home Depot, our growing e-commerce share gains around the globe, a robust emerging market growth program, growing revenue synergies from the Lenox/Irwin acquisition, continued revenue benefits from FlexVolt, and new innovations, and the recently announced IES transaction, quite a robust list. We also remain focused on our long-term strategy and our 2022 vision. When we announced 22/22, the base year was 2016 and we were $11 billion in revenue. We will be $14 billion this year, and we now have reasonable visibility to $22 billion by 2022 based on our growth pipeline and the transactions already announced, plus another $1 billion to $2 billion in acquired revenue in the 2020 to 2022 timeframe. That is very exciting and encouraging in the face of all these near-term challenges. Dennis, we are now ready for Q&A.
Dennis Lange - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hey, Jeff.
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I apologize. It might be a little bit of a multi-part question. But I just wanted to confirm what the headwind is for 2019. And it does sound like the restructuring action is just meant to counter the tariff-related headwinds, and therefore, you're relying on price and other methods to cover the balance. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit just on the restructuring. We view you as a very lean, well run, tightly managed company. $250 million is a big number. Maybe you could give us a little bit of color where that comes from, how you get it?
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Sure. I'll start with the first part of your question. So, yes, for 2019, we believe the headwinds of the three categories will be very similar to the 2018 level of $370 million at this stage. So about $200 million of that is related to tariffs, and then the remainder is split between commodity inflation and currency. So you can look at that and say $370 million. We're taking price actions on virtually all of those particular items. We've either done that this year or we will do it early next year related to List 3. In addition to that, we're also doing $250 million of cost takeout actions to be responsive to potentially more headwinds, potentially slower markets, and potentially managing our price dynamics, as we put all this price into the market next year to ensure we can have earnings growth next year. So we're trying to have different levers that we can pull associated with these headwinds, which allows us to grow our earnings, as I said, high single-digits for next year versus 2018. On the cost reduction side, I mean, we will go through a process that we've done many times before as a company. We haven't done one of these in a while. However, the discipline in structure on the process is very much focused on, what are the types of costs that we can take out that would not impact growth initiatives within the short-term and the midterm? How do we ensure that we don't slow momentum in some of these great growth catalysts that both Jeff and Jim talked about this morning? And so it will be very much targeted to activities that are removed from the customer in that regard, removed from the innovation categories, et cetera, that really do impact growth in the timeframe of the next one to three years.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hi Julian.
Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, just wondered if you could give a bit more color on the top line performance within U.S. Tools & Storage. Your U.S. retail sales slowed quite a lot in Q3. And that was before, I guess, for the price increases that will come. So maybe talk a little bit about the cadence of the Tools & Storage business demand in the U.S. And, also, what type of price increases you think you can get in the future without driving volume demand disruption as the demand seems to be softening kind of even before another round of price increases?
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah, so we – in the U.S. market in particular, we, as I mentioned in my comments, the transition of Craftsman as far as getting Craftsman into the stores, in Lowe's stores, is going very, very well. But as we look at the legacy brands that are being transitioned out, that impact has been a little bit more negative than we originally forecasted. So, therefore, that was one of the larger pressure points that we saw within the U.S. market. Our price expectation was a little bit higher than what actually occurred as well within the U.S. market. And so that was probably the second category. But the first one was probably the larger impact that really drove that. We will continue to put price into the market related to the tariffs that are coming in January for List 3. And we will also continue to monitor the elasticity of how the volume responds to those price increases. And we will manage through that in a way that is balanced along the lines that I touched on earlier where we have a dual objective. When we have market growth, we want to make sure that we outpace market growth at some level. So we're gaining share along the way through our innovation and our commercial excellence. At the same time, we want to manage our margin rate. So you have to have that balanced approach between the two. And so we'll be watching the price reaction in a very focused level. We'll continue to monitor that, and therefore, we'll have to make adjustments along the way to ensure that we achieve that dual objective which is another reason why we're taking costs out of the system, because as we manage that dynamic, it allows us to have another level to ensure that we can grow our earnings?
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: I also want to say – this is Jim. I also want to say that the U.S. consumer is alive and well, so this is not a doom and gloom story. This is – the wage rates are up and people are spending. Consumer confidence is off the charts, new records. So I think the – retail sales may have slowed slightly, but it's not like, all of a sudden, we have a vacuum in the demand. That could come. To your point, the elasticity of demand, all these price increases that companies are taking with respect to these tariffs, elasticity of demand surely will create some lower level of demand at some point in the future. But I want to make it very clear that it's not a doom and gloom story right now. And we don't expect it to be in the fourth quarter because the bulk of the tariff increases really don't hit until January 1st.
Jeffery D. Ansell - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: One point to add on to that, to what Jim and Don said, Julian, was that through the course of 2018, we have high confidence. We'll grow in the high single-digit range which will be 2X the market even as we launch 1,200 new Craftsman products, bringing down other brands to move them across the retail segment. So a lot of moving pieces, but we are very confident our growth will outpace the market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. Just a couple for me.
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hi, Rich, good morning.
Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: How are you doing? So, on $1 billion dollars, first of all, is that net of cannibalization. It sounds like there was some cannibalization here in Q4 or Q3 I should say, and so what would be that near-term in terms of the impact, how we should be thinking about that, and just clarity on that $1 billion. And then secondly, what is the price assumption now for the year for 2018? It was $190 million. I just wanted to get an update there. Thank you.
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah, so the $1 billion clearly includes some cannibalization. However, if you think about what Jeff and Jim talked about related to Home Depot, we would like to think that as we rolled that out in Home Depot for STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX that we can have a mitigating effect on some of the cannibalization that we're experiencing this year and into part of next year or a large portion of next year. So, if you look out over the four-year time horizon that the $1 billion dollars will evolve, our hope is, is that the cannibalization component of that is not very significant. But we'll see how that plays out over time, but we'll continue to see some cannibalization impact as we exit this year and we go into next year. But we do believe the cannibalization impact will be a little less in the fourth quarter and begin to mitigate itself a little bit more throughout 2019.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: That's also going to be affected by the Sears financial situation. So that business has to go somewhere. And we only had a very small amount of business with Sears. I think it was running around $50 million annually. So we feel like that is a very, very positive development from a revenue point of view for us.
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: As far as price this year to your second question, it will be lower than the previous communicated $190 million, probably by about $30 million to $40 million. That's kind of a rough magnitude of where it will be. A large chunk of that happened in Q3, and a little bit more will happen in Q4?
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: We will also say that the peak of the cannibalization really occurred in Q3. I mean, that's when we started most of this process. So the cannibalization rate will be less in Q4 and it will dissipate as we roll through 2019.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. Your line is open.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC: I also have a multi-part question here. So the first one is, that $125 million expense is what I see for the $250 million of savings, is that correct or what else have you got going in there to get to $250 million? And then secondly, I just want to come back to this pricing point that was just raised. A little more feeling for why you were $30 million to $40 million short, how that affects your timing and thinking of what will be really much more concern than I've got around 2019 versus 2018 as opposed to sort of the rest of this year. And I know you mentioned the demand part, but that – a bit better sense for how you were kind of digging in and really getting a higher comfort level that you can hold it given maybe your prior experiences with soft demand?
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: So part, the one answer is yes. $125 million and $250 million are – that's all of it. The second thing is, it's early days. And for anyone to speculate that they understand what the elasticity of demand is for all these SKUs in a timeframe when there is really no precedent for these types of price increases in the United States. On the other hand, we have a fair amount of experience in the emerging markets with pretty dramatic price increases. When the currencies weaken, we frequently find ourselves raising prices to offset those currency impacts, and you see continued solid growth in all those markets. We have double-digit growth in the emerging markets. Sometimes you end up with a shift from a volume-driven organic growth to more price-driven organic growth. But in the end, you get the organic growth and you protect the margins. And that's kind of our approach. So we can't tell you how much price we're going to get next year right now. One of the reasons we did, I think Don mentioned this, one of the reasons we did the cost reduction is because we want to have those levers. We want to be able to have the flexibility to manage our price volume and still drive earnings growth and that will give us the opportunity to do that in 2019.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, guys.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Josh.
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just wanted to dig in a little bit more on this STANLEY and FATMAX exclusivity announcement. You mentioned some disruption in the channel, call it cannibalization around some product line transitions. Could we see something similar with this as those brands get consolidated into Home Depot? And could you maybe size what that looks like? I think we can all kind of look at what Craftsman has been historically in the market through Sears, but I think this is another middle price point brand that seems like kind of a fair exchange offering for other channels. What's the size of that in the market today that will now be housed a little bit more exclusively inside Home Depot?
Unknown Speaker: Well, I'll give as much clarity as I can. But obviously this doesn't happen until 2019, so to speculate at all, that would be impossible. But to answer the question kind of thoroughly would be, the acquisition of the Craftsman brand we felt like gave us a great opportunity to convert share that had eluded us and every other tool company for generations. And I think that has proven to be very accurate, which is why we've now increased our number to $1 billion by year four rather than year ten. Concurrent with that, what we hope to do, but hadn't committed to till now I guess, is that with that, the advent of the Craftsman brand in our portfolio, it allowed us and will allow us to unlock other marquee brands in our stable of world-class brands to go exploit opportunities for share gain to customers that don't support Craftsman. So now you have a growth vehicle for Craftsman-based customers to go after share of Craftsman that has existed in Sears for many, many years, and opportunities to use the other brands to go after share within those locations against competition. And the combination of those two things is giving us an opportunity to do that domestically, and then use brands like Irwin/Lenox, et cetera, to do the same thing globally. So it's an outstanding opportunity. I guess, to comment back on the question about The Home Depot, I would say this, we've experienced accelerated growth on the Power Tools side with DEWALT corded products, DEWALT power tool accessories, DEWALT cordless, DEWALT outdoor and DEWALT FlexVolt. This advent of STANLEY and STANLEY FATMAX gives us the opportunity to replicate that type of incremental growth for us and for them, and on the Hand Tools & Storage side of the business. And it obviously represents share gain for them and for us or we wouldn't have taken the time to announce it today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hey, Mike.
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC: First question, I just wanted to circle back and just try and – and I apologize if you kind of hit on elements of this in previous questions. But just trying to think about 2019 and the puts and takes there, and if I'm missing anything or there are areas to elaborate on, appreciate it. So you have, on the one hand, the $370 million additional headwind from the three buckets of commodity, currency and tariff. On the flip side, you're looking at the $250 million of cost savings. And I was just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about the other positive drivers across volume growth, or sales growth, pricing and productivity. Because certainly, within this year, you're lowering the growth by 1%, and maybe that's a little bit due to more cannibalization. But I would suspect, particularly on the growth side, that you're still looking at some type of mid-single digit rate. And I was just curious if you could kind of help us frame thoughts around benefits from pricing as well as productivity?
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Well, let me just clarify one thing. We're not providing guidance for 2019, but we are providing some insight and direction as to what we see based on the actions that we're taking, as well as the headwinds that we have. So we wanted people to understand that we believe we have a way to grow our earnings in a meaningful way in 2019. We have headwinds to deal with, as we've talked about of $370 million. We will have price actions and carryover related to that. We'll have new price actions that we will put into the market, related to List 3 in January. Obviously, those will have a mitigating effect to those headwinds of some magnitude. We do expect to have some organic growth obviously in 2019 as well, and our objective is always to be within our 4% to 6% range. And we'll see, as we get closer to January, whether that's still our view. But at this point, there's nothing that says we should change that at this stage. The biggest wild card would be the impact of price and how we have to manage that along the lines that Jim was just describing, which leads us to why we're taking these cost actions, so we have levers to counter the potential impacts of price into the market. And therefore, we can ensure that we get to the end result of having meaningful earnings growth year-over-year. That's really about all we can say at this stage for 2019. And we'll provide more color as we get closer or get to January. But at this stage, that's how we feel, and we feel like we're positioning ourselves and setting ourselves up, so we can create that outcome for 2019.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: And the one thing I would mention as well, is that sometimes overlooked, as people do their analysis and they try to walk from one year to another, but sometimes overlooked is the variable cost productivity that we generate every year. And that will be in the neighborhood of 3% to 4% most years, and we see no reason why it shouldn't be in 2019. That would be additive productivity to the $250 million of cost savings. And so we have $9 billion of variable cost to work with for that 3% to 4%. And if you're trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together and the different scenarios that could occur, you make sure that you think through that as well. .
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hey, Nigel.
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hey, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC: There aren't too many companies talking about 2019, so really appreciate some of the moving pieces for next year. It's very helpful, so thanks for that.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yep.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC: I wanted to go back to Craftsman. So that's obviously a big influence for next year. And I'm curious if you just make – bring us back to where your capacity is right now, where you see that moving in 2019, and if Sears does go into Chapter 7 liquidation, what can you do to accelerate that production ramp?
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Very good question. We've worked really hard since March of 2017 to bring this 1,200 SKU product portfolio to life. And I'm very pleased at the initial rollout in the first 90 days of the rollout. Shipments are up. POS is up, representing share gain for us and our partners. But the other key component is our service levels on that product right now, almost 100%. And so we've capacitized ourselves. Before we would commit to $1 billion by 2021, we built capacity plans to support it. So we feel very good about our capability of supplying that accelerated demand through our existing 50, 60 manufacturing plant structure. Again, we make almost 90% of what we sell, so we have great control over those things, and we feel very confident we can support the accelerated demand created by Craftsman in whatever form it might be.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I guess just – sorry to go back to price again, but I guess, in your conversations with the home centers just on tariffs, are they kind of thinking of tariffs as kind of normal inflation where you need to kind of show them the inflation and then you kind of get prices to lag? Or I mean, since these tariffs are kind of clearly out there, are you able to maybe line up price increases more in line with those tariff increases? Just trying to get a little bit more color on just the confidence on pricing in Q1 and then how that might impact the cadence of price costs in the first half of next year?.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah, I don't think anybody except the home centers can get in the minds of the home centers. But I will say that the home centers appear, and frankly, all the customers appear to be in a position where they understand that their supply base cannot absorb onetime increases in the cost of this magnitude, 25%. And they understand that. They understand that they're not going to do it. And so in the end, this is all going to go to the consumer whether it's Tools or whether it's consumer products or whatever in other companies, other industries. And that I think is the way this is all going to play out and is playing out.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman. Your line is open.
Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC: Hi, good morning and thank you. Maybe another one for Jeff on the home centers. I guess for the HD exclusive, can you maybe just talk about what brought about that opportunity to have the exclusive conversation? And then when you look at the brands or the products that fall underneath, what will be exclusive, can you size the relative footprint today at Home Depot versus Lowe's?
Jeffery D. Ansell - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: I could do the first part of the question. I don't think I can provide the information on the second part of the question just is – it's confidential information. But I would say this that when we begin to build the architecture around the acquisition of Craftsman, Irwin and Lenox as well, we looked at all those brands and where they participated. And we were proactive in trying to manage the cannibalization that would occur across those brands if you allowed them all to reside in the same place. And we're proactive in going across our retail landscape with partners to use those brands to accelerate growth and share gain in various places. You've seen like four or five really good examples of that to this point with Craftsman and now STANLEY, STANLEY FATMAX. We also love all of our customers. So we wanted to have an opportunity to grow with each and every one of them. Growth at one at the expense of the other is a short-term solution and not ultimately very successful. So this took a lot of additional work. But it has taken us – it will take us to a place where share gain in the future is incremental to any share gain in the past. So we feel really good about that. In terms of the size, probably the only thing I can say is that we have been on accelerated growth trajectory with the Home Depot over the last decade across our portfolio. This will allow us to do in Hand Tools & Storage what has been really clearly done across Power Tools and Power Tool Accessories. So it will give us a complete growth platform with a really important customer .
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And I do appreciate all the color you've given us today. Maybe just a little bit more insight on the restructuring plan, obviously, the payback at 2X looks pretty good. So maybe can you give us a little bit more color around like the cadence of the benefits coming through for next year? And then also, if we do get level 4 tariffs, like is there – how would you go about tackling the potential impact from level 4?
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: So, yeah, I'll give you a little bit of color. As far as the restructuring, as we said in our press release, we will complete the vast majority of the actions associated with it by the end of 2018. So, therefore, we would expect a pretty even cadence across the four quarters of 2019. And so I think you can pretty much move that across the quarter. The bulk of the charge, obviously, will take place in the fourth quarter of 2018. The second question was around what? What was it on?
Unknown Speaker: The List 4 tariffs.
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: List 4 tariffs. So List 4 tariffs, we'll take the approach that I described when I went through that on the slide. That the first step of actions will be price increases in the marketplace. The second step will be looking at, is there an exclusion process that we can go through with the U.S. government because there is some disadvantage that we have in the marketplace as a result of the tariff. And then the third will be looking at what we can do to our supply chain to change aspects of the supply chain as to where things are manufactured, whether it's bringing things to the U.S., to the – along our strategy of make where we sell, or is it moving into another country because it makes more sense to do that, both from a market perspective and a financial perspective. So those will be like the three levels of steps that we would go through. Very similar to what we're going through with List 3, and what we've gone through with the previous two Lists related to the tariffs.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Not all tariffs are horrible at this point. The tariff impact to some categories, like boxes, metal boxes, they have actually been positive for us. But wave 4 would also accelerate our advantage based on our domestic manufacturing footprint.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC: Hi, good morning. I wanted to talk about just...
Unknown Speaker: Good morning.
Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC: Thank you. Operationally, on Craftsman, as Sears goes through its process, do you need to spend more in advertising, et cetera, promotions to sort of pull those revenues to you? Make sure they don't get lost in transition. And is there any risk from whatever actions they make take in 4Q to load and do massive sales or whatever to push stuff through their channel?
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Well, you never know how they're going to behave when they're under protection. But I will say that it's been a fantastic execution. And it's been a real partnership with our retail partner, Lowe's. The sales and marketing resources that they have brought to bear to make this program successful, in conjunction with the sales and marketing resources that we've invested, is like nothing that has ever been done in our industry. So I think the answer to your question is that we've done everything that we need to do to pull those sales from Sears into Stanley Black & Decker and Lowe's. And maybe some will drift out into some of our other retail partners, but we've got that well covered too as we talked about. So we're very pleased and very optimistic with the situation, about the situation.
Donald Allan, Jr. - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: And we feel very well prepared for this. We've been preparing for this. All we didn't know was the date of when it would happen. So Jim referenced the connection between us and Lowe's going forward, and it is exemplary and it is out in front. We're likewise aligned in the hardware channel with Ace, we're likewise aligned with Amazon in the e-commerce space. So we are prepared in whatever fashion that Craftsman customer wants to find the product to make sure that we are front and center and ready to convert.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have further questions. Thank you.

Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2018 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker’s second quarter 2018 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning’s call will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don, and Jeff, will review our second quarter 2018 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It’s therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
Jim Loree: Thank you, Dennis and good morning everyone. As you saw from our press release, we delivered an impressive second quarter under the circumstances and reaffirm total year EPS guidance, up 13% at the midpoint. In doing this, we fended off a significant array of exogenous headwinds, which included input cost inflation, FX and most recently, tariffs. Our ability to do that was a result of an outstanding growth performance, which provided both incremental volume and volume leverage as well as tight cost controls, especially on the SG&A line. And while we had telegraphed in our April release that these headwinds would create short-term margin pressure, we also expressed confidence in our ability to substantially offset them through pricing actions and productivity, albeit with a brief timing lag. And as it turns out, our pricing options are progressing according to plan as evidenced by our actual price realization, which was a full point in the quarter. That number will continue to grow in Q3 and Q4 and there will be substantial price carryover into 2019. The short story behind our success in the quarter was agile management that provided real-time visibility into the issues, leveraged our growth momentum and included a rapid and decisive response to headwinds with pricing options and cost controls tools. Tools & Storage and Industrial both exceeded our growth expectations and all three segments contributed to a robust 7% organic growth performance for the overall company. Acquisitions contributed 3 points of growth and the total company revenue increased 11% to $3.6 billion. With tools and markets remaining healthy in most areas around the globe, we continue to see strong underlying demand and share gain in Tools & Storage which delivered an outstanding 10% organic growth in the quarter. In Tools, we are utilizing multiple levers to deliver consistent above market organic growth even in the phase of tough comps. We remain focused on commercial excellence, completing the integration of our acquisitions, program managing the Craftsman rollout, and delivering strong gains in emerging markets and e-commerce. Moving to Industrial now, where we also outperformed expectations once again. Total segment growth was 14%, with an 11 point contribution from the Nelson Fasteners acquisition. Continued momentum in Engineered Fastening and Hydraulic Tools more than offset the expected decline in oil and gas. We were very pleased with Engineered Fastening, which overcame anticipated weakness in systems sales to record 3% organic growth. In this vein, we continued to achieve significant penetration gains in automotive fasteners, which were up more than 600 basis points versus industry light vehicle production. Diluted adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.57 as price, lower expenses and volume leverage more than offset the dilutive earnings impact of commodity inflation and currency. It is a noteworthy performance considering that we leaned into $70 million of headwinds, including $20 million of additional FX, which materialized as several emerging market currencies substantially weakened during the last 8 weeks of the quarter. In addition, we completed $200 million in share repurchases in April and will continue to be open to more of the same if the market continues to discount our ability to look to deliver our commitments and the growing array of powerful growth catalysts, which today are as substantial as anytime during the almost two decades that I have served as an executive of this company. These catalysts include Craftsman, FLEXVOLT, revenue synergies from the Newell Tools acquisition, emerging markets and e-commerce in general as well as our inorganic growth pipeline. Craftsman is one compelling organic growth initiative originally expected to be to reach $1 billion in sales in year 10. We are now confident that this timeframe will be shorter and while the ultimate size is indeterminable at this time, the potential for this program to exceed $1 billion is very real given the retail placements we have achieved, which include a major home center, one of the world’s largest e-commerce players a major U.S. co-op in several other important channels. Our DEWALT FLEXVOLT tool assortment and battery system installed base continues to expand with innovation reaching into higher power categories, where cordless power tools have never previously existed. Additionally, the FLEXVOLT battery pack is synergistic with our 20-volt system enhancing its growth and is thus a positive force for the broader DEWALT family of products. As for Newell Tools, the integration of Irwin and Lenox is nearly complete and we are now turning our attention to revenue synergies, which over a multiyear period we expect to represent $100 million to $150 million organic growth as we broadened the distribution of these products around the world. In the emerging markets, we continue to deliver double-digit growth and share gain we are leveraging our unique to the industry business model, the strength of our brands and our complete market basket, including Stanley branded mid-price point corded and cordless power tools as well as hand tool products and we are having great success growing it 2x to 3x market growth rates. Across both the emerging markets and developed markets, e-commerce continues to remain a key commercial driver, which this year represents a $1 billion high growth business for us, a channel in which we are the industry leader in both the U.S. and across the globe, an excellent source of high double-digit growth. And lastly, our M&A pipeline has never been stronger and include several strategically and financially attractive growth opportunities under review. These days, some of our most challenging short-term capital allocation decisions, involve trade-offs between pursuing specific M&A opportunities or alternatively repurchasing more of our own equity. And as we always do, we will strike a good balance between the two and stay true to our long-term capital allocation framework that is to first fund all appropriate organic growth activities and then allocate excess capital 50% to M&A and the other 50% to returning capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. With regard to the former, you will note that earlier this week, we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, which represents the 51st consecutive year of annual dividend increases, an incredible record. So that’s it, a powerful growth story with more catalysts to come, which we will usher along in the back half and into 2019 and beyond as we navigate our way through these transitory 2018 headwinds. And now I will turn it over to Don Allan who will walk you through the segment highlights, the overall financial results and 2018 guidance. Don?
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results in the second quarter. Tools & Storage delivered 11% revenue growth, with an impressive 10% organic growth and 1 point of currency. And as Jim highlighted earlier, the initial effects of our price increases contributed 1 point of organic growth. The operating margin rate was 16.2% versus 17.6% in the second quarter of 2017 as benefits of volume leverage pricing, productivity and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation and currency. The vast majority of the $50 million of commodity inflation and $20 million of currency that the company experienced in the second quarter was absorbed by the Tools & Storage business. The strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU. On a geographic basis, North America was up 10% organically with growth across all channels. The U.S. retail channel has generated low double-digit growth, U.S. commercial markets posted high single-digit growth and our industrial and auto repair markets generated mid single-digit growth. Additionally, Canada contributed exceptional organic growth of 13%. North America’s growth continued to be fueled by new product innovations, the initial Craftsman rollout supporting the Father’s Day promotion at Lowe’s and Ace, a recovery in the outdoor products segment, and of course, our pricing efforts in response to commodity inflation and currency. This growth was achieved while maintaining normal inventory levels within our major customers in North America, the U.S. tool market continues to be supportive providing a sound backdrop for organic growth initiatives that Jim just mentioned. Europe delivered another solid performance with 5% organic growth. All 10 markets grew organically, with above average contributions from Central Europe, the UK, Greece, France and Iberia. The team continues to deliver market share gains as they leverage our portfolio brands, deliver new product innovations and expand retail relationships to produce the strong organic growth. Finally, emerging markets continued their trend of outstanding organic growth, up 17% with all regions contributing. Diligent pricing actions to offset currency headwinds which weekly arose in Q2 as well as a continued focus on e-commerce and the ongoing MPP launch continued to support growth in this part of Tools & Storage. Geographically, Latin America was headlined by double-digit growth in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Our change to a direct selling model within Turkey and Russia continued to fuel exceptional growth for those countries. And in addition, India, Korea and Japan also posted notable double-digit growth. Both Tools & Storage SBUs showed 10% growth in the quarter. The Power Tools & Equipment Group was led by Professional Power Tools, which was up low double-digits. The consumer power tool group rebounded nicely from the first quarter impacts of the outdoor and Craftsman transition posting mid single-digit growth. Power Tools & Equipment benefited from new product introductions, leveraging our core innovation efforts, continued expansion of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system and of course, sharp commercial execution. FLEXVOLT continues to be a differentiated growth driver for Tools & Storage. Shipments were on plan and we again saw double-digit organic growth within the North America retail channel and Europe. The 10% organic growth within hand tools, accessories and storage was due to new product introductions, strong performances within the construction and industrial-focused product lines and the contribution from Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies. Hand Tools and Storage business delivered an outstanding 11% organic growth, while accessories, was up 6%, another solid performance from this team. So in summary a great quarter for the Tools & Storage organization, where they delivered organic growth in nearly every market, initiated price increases to counter the impacts from commodity inflation currency and tariffs, all while keeping the acquisition integration and execution of the strong portfolio of growth catalysts on track. Now that is agility. Turning to Industrial, this segment delivered flat organic growth, albeit better than internal expectations. Similar to the theme from Tools and Storage, operating margin rate declined year-over-year to 16.8% as productivity and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation, growth investments and the modestly dilutive impact from the acquisition of Nelson Fasteners. Engineered Fastening posted total growth of 20%, with the acquisition of Nelson Fasteners. Organic growth was 3% during the quarter as strong automotive and industrial fastener growth more than offset the expected declines in automotive systems due to lower model rollover activity from our customers. This team has successfully leveraged their base business model to deliver technology, engineering and productivity solutions to increase fastener sales 800 basis points over light vehicle production across the first half of 2018 after growing over 500 basis points over light vehicle production in the second half of 2017. Specifically, we have developed a host of joining and fastening solutions that are positioned for the key trends within the automotive space, namely electrification and light-weighting. Additionally, the team has focused on the high growth local and regional Asian OEMs that are now demanding the higher technology and quality solutions we provide, another great example of commercial excellence at Stanley, Black & Decker. And then finally, the early days of the Nelson integration remain on track to plan and the business is demonstrating pro forma organic growth with strength in the shipbuilding and construction verticals, all-in-all a very solid quarter for Engineered Fastenings. The infrastructure business has posted organic decline of 10% for the quarter. Hydraulic Tools grew organically for the seventh consecutive quarter posting mid single-digit growth as they continue to see the benefits from successful commercial launches. Meanwhile, oil and gas posted a high-teen organic decline in the quarter as expected given the lower pipeline project activity versus the prior year. And then finally, the Security segment demonstrated total growth of 6%, which included the benefits of small bolt-on acquisitions, currency and price partially offset by a 1.5% volume decline in the second quarter. North America growth was down 2% organically as higher automatic door and healthcare volumes were more than offset by lower volume in commercial electronic security, which did have a difficult comparable due to the large installation project activity that occurred in the second quarter of 2017. Europe organic growth was flat as strength in the Nordics was offset by anticipated ongoing weakness in France. In terms of profitability, the segment operating margin was 10%. The rate was down 100 basis points versus the prior year as it was impacted by targeted investments to support the ongoing transformation of the business partially offset by continued cost containment. The security team remains focused on the business transformation, which is targeting three key areas within commercial electronic security: one, applying digital technologies to improve the effectiveness of our service and monitoring organization, while significantly lowering the cost to serve; two, delivering simpler and more flexible solutions for our small to medium-sized customers; and three, leveraging business analytics to provide key business insights to our large national account customers. These initiatives, along with focus on commercial and operational excellence, will position the business for sustained revenue growth and margin expansion over the next 2 years. Now, let’s take a quick look at the quarter’s free cash flow performance on the next page. I would like to highlight that the 2017 cash flow amounts presented reflect the results as previously reported and exclude the impacts of the new accounting standards adopted in January of this year. These accounting standards change the classification of an AR sales program that has since been terminated and has no impact in 2018. We believe that presenting the cash flow results in this manner for 2017 provides a more meaningful view of the company’s historical operating cash flow performance. So, to the actual results for cash flow. For the second quarter, free cash flow was $86 million, which provides our year-to-date performance, but brings our year-to-date performance to a use of cash of $369 million. The quarterly and year-to-date declines versus the prior year are predominantly explained by carrying higher amounts of working capital to support the outsized level of organic growth and upcoming Tools & Storage product launches as well as higher tax payments related to the newly enacted U.S. total charge. From a working capital term perspective, we delivered 6.6 turns in the second quarter, which is a decrease of 0.7 turns versus the prior year. This decline is primarily due to requirements needed to support growth and new product launches, including the pending Craftsman rollout. We are confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation in the second half of the year given our core SFS processes and principles combined with reducing working capital levels in line with normal seasonal activity. In addition, we will continue to maintain adequate amount of working capital to support our new increased growth expectations. Therefore, we are reiterating our commitment to deliver our free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 100% supported by this expected strong second half cash generation. I would now like to take a minute to provide an update on the external headwinds we are facing this year. And just as importantly, the recovery actions we are executing. We continue to see elevated commodity prices and as a result now expect inflation headwinds to approximate $205 million in 2018, with about $100 million already realized year-to-date. This is up $25 million from our previous expectation of $180 million. Steel, batteries and base metals remain the most significant commodities generating this headwind. Additionally during the last 8 weeks of the quarter, we saw significant currency impacts emerge as the U.S. dollar strengthened. At this time, we estimate this headwind to approximate $80 million in 2018, the pressures being driven primarily by the currencies of Argentina, Brazil, Turkey and Russia. In response, we already implemented an initial set of price increases in June, with an additional set of actions planned for the third quarter. Now, shipping to tariffs, we currently estimate the impact of tariffs to be a 2018 headwind of approximately $35 million. This reflects the impact of Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as the initial $34 billion of Section 301 tariffs on componentry and some finished goods. We have initiated price increases for these implemented tariffs and look to further mitigate the remaining impact via the exclusion, the formal exclusion process, where applicable. In response to these $320 million of total external pressures on this page, we have taken a series of recovery actions. First, we have implemented or are in the process of implementing price increases that should yield $190 million during 2018. This is an increase of $70 million from the $120 million in actions discussed in April. Approximately $40 million of that change is related to foreign currency in emerging markets with the $30 million balance in response to higher commodity inflation and implemented tariffs. We expect the remaining price increases to be implemented during the August-September time period. In addition, $36 million in other cost and productivity actions will be executed to help these external pressures to help offset these external pressures. These represent discretionary cost reductions pacing of some investments that have longer term paybacks and incremental productivity opportunities. These are not investments that will jeopardize key programs that support organic growth in the short to medium-term. Now, turning to the right side of the chart to address the additional $200 billion in tariffs under Section 301 that were announced on July 10, we have not included the impact of these tariffs in our guidance due to the uncertainty around implementation timing and the product categories that will ultimately be included. Prior to mitigating actions, we estimate the annual impact to be approximately $70 million to $80 million. Therefore, if you assume and it is an assumption at September 1 implementation, the 2018 impact could be approximately $25 million. However, we believe this is the potential headwind that we can manage within our current guidance through additional price actions as well as our remaining contingency. These tariffs are focused primarily on finished goods such as vacuums and tools and power tool accessories. If these are implemented, we will look to initiate price actions on affected categories to protect our profitability. Now that these tariffs are beginning to hit finished products, it’s important to note that approximately 50% of our North American tools revenue is supported by our North American manufacturing facilities. This undoubtedly puts us in a favorable position versus competition to navigate these tariffs and may create opportunities for increased demand at our local facilities. So, a lot of moving pieces, but we are acting with agility to implement price and cost actions to offset these transitory headwinds and once they have abate we will have the business positioned for a favorable setup. Moving to our 2018 guidance, we are reiterating our 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.30 to $8.50, up approximately 13% versus the prior year at the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, we now expect earnings per share range of $7 to $7.20 inclusive of M&A and other charges. This is a reduction of $0.40 versus our prior outlook. The change in the GAAP guidance is related to the recently announced CPA settlement. Now diving into a little more detail in our 2018 adjusted EPS outlook. You can see on the left hand side of the chart, we expect the previously mentioned benefits from incremental price, cost and productivity actions to generate approximately $0.48 of EPS accretion versus our April guidance assumption. We have also increased our organic volume growth expectations by 1 point contributing an additional $0.12 of EPS accretion. Including the benefits from price, we now expect organic growth to approximate 7% for the company. Finally in April, we also executed a share repurchase of $200 million contributing approximately $0.10 of EPS accretion. This cumulative $0.70 of EPS accretion will be offset in its entirety by higher expectations for commodity inflation, tariffs and currency I just discussed. A few brief model-related planning items. We are revising our average shares outstanding to approximately $153 million, which reflects the April purchase. Second item, we expect lower other net expenses due to the favorable to 2Q resolution of a prior claim. However, this will be offset by increased interest expense expectations reflective of higher interest rates and debt levels due to working capital needs. Third item, we continue to anticipate approximately $50 million of core restructuring charges in 2018. However, the second half charges will be weighted more to the third quarter. Finally, we expect third quarter EPS to approximate 24% of the full year 2018 guide as our third quarter will see the largest impact from commodity inflation and currency, while price increases continue to be implemented throughout the quarter. And finally, turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, organic growth within Tools & Storage is now expected to be high single-digits in 2018 reflective of strong volume trends in our incremental pricing actions. We believe that market conditions remain supportive and provide a favorable backdrop for our pipeline of organic growth catalysts. This team is focused on key initiatives, FLEXVOLT, Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, e-commerce, emerging markets and the continued rollout of the Craftsman brand. We are now expecting the segment margin performance to be slightly down year-over-year given the elevated currency and commodity headwinds. In the Industrial segment, we now expect relatively flat performance year-over-year in organic growth versus our prior expectation of low single-digit decline. With the business performing above expectations in the first half of the year, the automotive and industrial fastener growth as well as Hydraulic Tools volume should offset the market-related pressures from automotive systems and lower levels of project activity within oil and gas. We continue to expect our segment margins within industrial to be down year-over-year primarily due to the Nelson Fastener acquisition, but also slightly due to the incremental pressure from inflation and tariffs in these businesses. Nelson currently carried below segment average margins, but with cost synergies, we will get these margins up to the line average in a relatively short timeframe. Finally, in the Security segment, we now expect the organic growth to be relatively flat year-over-year, implying low single-digit organic growth in the second half of the year. We are also revising our margin outlook to down year-over-year as we continue to focus on the business transformation I previously discussed. So in summary, we believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company to deliver a robust 7% organic growth, with 13% adjusted EPS expansion. This is overcoming approximately $320 million in commodity inflation, tariffs and currency pressure. In addition, we remain focused on free cash flow generation, price realization, productivity and cost management, acquisition integrations and the rollout of the Craftsman brand. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff to say a few words about the Tools performance. Jeff?
Jeff Ansell: Thank you, Don. That was a comprehensive overview for the quarter, but I just want to highlight a few key points. First, we continue to generate share gains around the world as evidenced by the strong double-digit growth in North America and emerging markets as well as mid single-digit growth in Europe. As you look across the strategic business units, or SBUs, both delivered 10% organic growth. As expected, our outdoor business recovered on a year-to-date basis in Q2 from the decline in Q1 due to weather. Overall, underlying demand looks to remain strong for the remainder of 2018. Next, Craftsman remains on track delivering about 1 point of growth in the quarter and the initial indications on sell-through are positive. Notably, we are converting new users to the Craftsman brand, which is a share gain opportunity for our retail partners in us. The end-user feedback has been positive with top quartile product rating reviews. We remain on track to execute the initial wave of product and store conversion in the second half of this year. Consistent with our prior communications, Lowe’s and Ace will begin to transition to the new Craftsman offerings across the back half of 2018 with completion in 2019. Lowe’s and Ace expect to have promotional product in all stores by the end of the year. We also expect to begin to provide the Craftsman metal storage to Amazon in Q4, with broader rollout to continue in 2019. Other acquisitions remain positive as well. The integrations remain on track and growth of Irwin, Lenox and Waterloo demonstrated high single-digit organic growth in the quarter. Finally, we are encouraged by positive price in the second quarter and are confident that we will achieve the price realization actions that Don outlined earlier. Now, I will turn it back to Jim to wrap up today’s presentation.
Jim Loree: Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Another great quarter for you and your team at Tools and for the total company. In summary, second quarter revenue growth was 11%. All businesses contributed. This was powered by 7% organic growth for the overall company 10% as I mentioned earlier in Tools & Storage. We successfully offset approximately $70 million of headwinds tied to the inflation currency. Importantly, a factor in this was the initial benefit of our pricing actions in the quarter. We delivered 1 point of organic growth from price in the quarter and continue to display the agility necessary to deal with the adversity from some of these external factors. We are confident that we will continue to be successful in the second half. Therefore, we are reiterating adjusted EPS guidance of $8.30 to $8.50, representing a 13% year-over-year increase at midpoint. Capital allocation remains a priority. And as I said, we are evaluating near-term actions to create shareholder value, including both acquisition opportunities and the potential for additional share repurchases. And as we look to close out a successful 2018, we are focused on day-to-day execution and operational excellence. This includes generating above market organic growth leveraging our momentum, driving operating leverage, delivering price productivity and cost actions and successfully integrating our recent acquisition, so lots going on to drive a great year. All of this will also result in strong free cash flow generation at near 100% of net income. And I am confident that we will bring the same level of passion, intensity and agility that we demonstrated in the first half to successfully deliver the second half thus producing another great year for Stanley, Black & Decker. In fact, we are already on it. Dennis, we are now ready for Q&A?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Jim. Shannon, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Winoker with UBS. You may begin.
Steve Winoker: Thanks. Good morning guys and great to see the volume and pricing traction. And I just want to stick on that, the detail is very helpful on Slide 8. In that though, when you talk about expecting to mitigate the potential additional $25 million if that comes to path, how long you think you can really get the price or how much price you really build in, in that short timeframe given how long it takes as you have taught us all in terms of the lag time for pricing to materialize and how does this relate to the contingency that you guys have talked about also in prior months? I assume that’s all gone at this point. But maybe just give us some color on that.
Don Allan: I will take that. Yes, so the latest proposed wave of tariffs as I mentioned in my presentation, if, now still a big if, if it was implemented on September 1, the impact would be $25 million to us in 2018. We believe that within a reasonable timeframe given what we have done with other tariffs and the pricing actions associated with that, that we will be able to offset maybe a third to a half of that with price increases in the year if that occurs on September 1. And then the remaining component of that we would utilize what we have is a contingency to cover the gap between the difference, but you are correct, our contingency within our current guidance is relatively small right now and so we don’t have a lot of ability to maneuver beyond these types of things, but we still have some contingency left. It’s just not as significant, than it was 3 months ago given all the other actions in headwinds that we have seen over the coming 90 days or the last 90 days.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin.
Richard Kwas: Hi, good morning everyone.
Jim Loree: Hi, Rich.
Richard Kwas: How are you doing? On 301, just as we think about it given your manufacturing capabilities, you talked about price in using that, but it also seems like you have some optionality around taking advantage of your manufacturing base here in North America versus the competition. So, how would you think about toggling price and then potential opportunity for share gains?
Jeff Ansell: So, I will take the question. This is Jeff. The make where you sell initiative that Jim has talked about for several years now at this point has certainly provided us an opportunity. So we will take price to offset both commodity inflation and tariffs, all the things that Don has already outlined, but beyond that, we clearly are in the best position from a made in North America perspective around tariffs to execute two things. One, the great volume increases that we have just outlined for the quarter. That was our domestic manufacturing footprint allowed us to keep up pace with that tremendous growth. It also provides us opportunities for the future in terms of products, but not impacted by tariffs while competitive products are. So we feel like we are probably in the best position in the space to deal with the future given these things.
Jim Loree: And the other point I would like to make, it’s Jim, is that we don’t know what the lifespan of these tariffs is going to be a couple of months, couple of years forever, who knows. So, supply chain maneuverability is there, but we also have to be cognizant that anytime you move supply chain around significantly there is cost associated with it and there is also risk associated with it. So in the near-term, there won’t be a lot of supply chain maneuvering, it will be mostly price and then we will see as time goes on if there are structural changes to the supply chain that we would like to make, because if it appears that some of these tariffs are going to be longer term in nature.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. You may begin.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, good morning everyone.
Jim Loree: Hey, Rob.
Rob Wertheimer: So, you have quantified I think pretty rigorously all the tariff impact, so that’s extremely helpful. One quick question, are there any other offsets that are possible, so Jim mentioned, you have take care of a consideration on changing sourcing, but Chinese currency weakening any categorization or exemptions or whatever, I am just trying to figure out how much of potential offsets you have included in the numbers that you have provided on the actual cost could be, what can come back that’s not in there?
Jim Loree: Yes. I would say, right now, the vast majority of the assets are price increases being passed on to our customers. As Jim said, we will continue to evaluate other alternatives as time goes on here, but we really don’t know the length of these tariffs and if they preview them to be longer term, then as we get into next year, we will start to evaluate other options, but our focus right now is really transferring the stock’s increase on to the customers and the end users, because we have seen a very direct cost increase and it’s something that we believe that’s the more appropriate response in the short and medium-term.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on the quarter. I also wanted to just circle back to price cost, obviously one of the key investor themes so far year-to-date. And what strikes me, I think a lot of people from the slides and again going back to Slide #8, which is very, very helpful? So thanks for that. You see the acceleration in price recovery now expected this year whereas previous couple of calls, you are at a $50 million to $60 million gap, if you just look at commodity inflation versus price. And now you have narrowed that gap pretty significantly as you talk to accelerating some price actions. So just trying to get a better sense of which regions those might be and I think you have talked about at points, emerging markets having some better ability to exact price. If it’s possible to kind of roughly break down that $190 million and also what you have achieved a year-to-date?
Jim Loree: Okay, it’s Jim. We are not going to necessarily breakdown the entire 190, but I can tell you of the, first of all, currency is probably the most volatile of all the different headwinds that we have this year and currency when it hits in the emerging markets, it’s almost instantaneous our ability to respond, because the markets are conditioned and our organization is conditioned and we have excellent tracking of the FX impact on various countries and so on. So, we have institutionalized a kind of price increase, price management function within the emerging markets and our systems enable us and the market enables us to react almost on a dime. So, that’s the first thing. The second thing is with respect to cost inflation when the cost inflation first started hitting, it was a gradual kind of increase over several months at the back – starting with the back half of last year and it was very difficult to have customer discussions until it became large enough so that we could have those customer discussions when it was large enough to do that, we did it and once we did it, there was a lag in implementation that naturally occurs when you have the discussions and then the discussions turn into agreements and then the agreements turn into implementations and that’s particularly true with the larger customers, especially in North America, but also in Europe. So, that’s inflation. Tariffs are relatively straightforward, because they are very easy to calculate. You know what, the percentages, you know what the impact is, they affect the entire industry and there is – it’s highly unlikely that anyone competitor is going to say a 20% increase or 10% increase in the cost of their products is going to eat that. And so it becomes a fairly kind of logical action for both the suppliers and the customers to implement and that’s until the timing is much shorter in that regard and also in some cases, the tariffs overlap – or tariffs that were already implemented and price increases have been instituted and in some cases we are able to go back and just incorporate the new tariffs into the previously implemented price increases. So, for all those reasons, there is no straightforward answer to your question, there is a lot of complexity to it, but we have a fantastic ability to have a control of it and handle on it and be able to predict it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jason Makishi: Hi, guys. This is actually Jason on for Julian. Maybe more for Jeff, so the scope of the Tools & Storage volume improvement was that sort of the cadence of that more weighted towards the back end of the quarter? And I guess in terms of the volume surprise, where did the greatest amount of strength relative to your expectations come in and if there was scope for further improvement geographically or by product, where would that be?
Jeff Ansell: Well, if you look at the growth profile for the quarter, I guess the word I would use would be pervasive. So, if you look at the results that were shared earlier, the double-digit growth across North America, single-digit growth across Europe, double-digit growth across the emerging markets and double-digit growth across both strategic business units, I would just say there is not a really easy way to explain, but just pervasive would be the point. So, that explains 8 points of the growth. We did get a benefit of 1 point from Craftsman, we got a benefit of 1 point from the outdoor recovery, but just fantastic growth pervasively around the world is probably the best explanation I can give you and we are very, very pleased with it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: Hey, everybody. Good morning. Nice job managing through all this.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Tim.
Tim Wojs: I had just more of a strategic question. So there is a larger lawn and garden OEM that sounds like they are exiting a portion of their business over the next couple of years. And so my question is, is there opportunity for you to get bigger in lawn and garden from a manufacturing perspective? And how critical is having that manufacturing for Craftsman reaching that kind of line average margin by 2021?
Jim Loree: Very good question. And the answer is lawn and garden is strategic to us post the acquisition of the Craftsman brand. We are exploring opportunities to form partnerships and/or acquiring some assets within that space that would have manufacturing and we have been working on that for a while. And I would expect sometime in the foreseeable future some sort of an announcement coming from us that will leverage our Craftsman brand and presence in the marketplace in lawn and garden, but in a way that will not subject us to the types of volatility that you saw with that one announcement or also in a way that will not subject us to severe operating margin dilution that sometimes occurs in that particular industry, especially from the standpoint of first half versus second half. So, we are actually all over this. We have studied it very thoroughly. We have had numerous conversations with participants in the industry and stay tuned, it won’t be long, I think before you see something that will make a lot of sense for Stanley Black & Decker.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Speer with Zelman Associates. Your line is open.
Justin Speer: Good morning, guys.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Justin Speer: Recognizing, I know you are not going to guide to 2019, but to me the market is pricing in a structural issue with regards to the margin and return profile is associated with some of these tariffs and currency moves – auditing moves. I wanted to get your sense for the levers that you had to pull to offset the carryover of the current FX and prospective tariffs and commodities that are rolling through as you look to next year just walking through. And as you think about it, I mean, as it graduates to next year, I think there is some concerns that you won’t be able to do that and I guess I’d like to get your perspective on that both from a pricing and internal levers to pull standpoint.
Jim Loree: It’s Jim. I will tackle this as an ex-CFO.
Don Allan: We are in trouble.
Jim Loree: The one thing people don’t really necessarily appreciate – and I think you obviously do based on the question is that when we go after offsetting these types of things whether it’s inflation, currency, tariffs, whatever it might be – yes, we are going to recover a certain percentage of the headwind in totality over time and the remainder – so let’s say that percentage on the average be 70% or 80%. The remaining 20% to 30% is more than offset by the productivity that we generate on a day-to-day basis continuously in our supply chain and our plant system. So we look at these things from a timing perspective, yes, they cause some AJA in the near-term, because we have to respond to the headwind when it arrives and it takes a little time obviously as witnessed this quarter with some operating margin dilution offset by volume gains, but as we flip into the successive year, 2019, by definition, there is going to be some price carryover that is not impacted by new headwinds, if all else equal. So, if there are no new headwinds, then we will have price carryover that will be positive and in the case of 2019, the initial look is meaningfully positive. And so we will see what happens with inflation, with FX and currency as we go forward, but all else equal if we had no more headwinds, there would be a meaningful number of positive accretion to margin that would ultimately end up in margins catching up to where they were before and maybe up a little bit beyond that. And then the story for 2019 for Stanley, Black & Decker is going to be what I talked a lot about earlier, which is the growth catalysts are going to really hit their stride in 2019. We have been growing incredibly well here in this company over the past few years and these catalysts are as strong as I mentioned earlier as I have seen in my entire career here, spanning two decades and we are setup for growth in 2019 that will I think be pretty significant. So, that’s kind of the story with us. There is an arbitrage. It’s affected by timing in the early stages of the headwinds. It’s negative in the late stages when they anniversary. It goes positive to catch up and then beyond that maybe some additional accretion based on productivity and mix management and so forth. And then, you have got the growth for next year.
Don Allan: And as I will just add on to that, as the current CFO, I will add on and validate what Jim said. It’s completely accurate obviously, but I think also when you look at history, you go back in time and you look at how we have responded to commodity inflation, currency, and you look at it over a 2-year window. In year one, we tend to recover depending on the timing of when these things happen, but in normal course, we tend to recover close to two-thirds of the headwind in year one. But when you look at it over a 2-year period of time, our history has been that we recover somewhere between 75% and 85% of the total headwinds through price actions and then the difference is covered through the things that Jim was mentioning around productivity. So, our history would demonstrate that for next year we would have a positive impact from the net of all these different things that Jim was describing. So I think that’s an important factor that you have to keep in mind that this is not something unusual, this is something that we can point to three or four different occasions over the last 20 years where this has occurred.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura. Your line is open.
Michael Wood: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask you about the seasonality of earnings. It looks like to hit the fourth quarter implied guidance range, your Tools segment incremental margins – look like they would have to get back to or better than what you typically see in the mid 20% range. So, I just wanted to see – is that the correct way to think about Tools segment incremental margins as we go into the fourth quarter and just what does that imply with where you are in price/cost at that point in time in the segment? Thank you.
Jeff Ansell: Yes. I think the way to think about it is you have to recognize that the commodity inflation started in 2017, so we had a fair amount of commodity inflation in the fourth quarter of ‘17. And in the fourth quarter this year, we will see the biggest impact from pricing actions will be in the fourth quarter when you look at the full year. So that pricing impact continues to grow from the second quarter to the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And actually at this point, the pricing impact reverses the headwinds in the fourth quarter and will be a slight positive and so that will be the first quarter we will experience that here in 2018. And so that’s certainly going to help margins combining with the fact that you have a comp where you are dealing with margins that were suppressed in the fourth quarter of 2017, because that was really the beginning of the commodity inflation wave. I think that’s the best way to think about it why the profitability will be higher in Tools in the fourth quarter versus what we have experienced in the first three quarters of this year as well as why it will be higher versus prior year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Ken Zener: Gentlemen, good morning.
Jim Loree: Good morning, Ken.
Ken Zener: Jeff, could you comment on North America Pro Power Tools, the gains were so strong. It seems as though much more of the gains were happening on the pro side versus the DIY side. So Hitachi in the private equity company, Makita, Bosch, are the share gains really coming from like-for-like product or how should we think about your extending your product reach? So, it’s obviously flexible. You are able to dislocate Bosch’s high end table saw for example. That’s kind of a new reach for you. How much of it share gains in the like-for-like categories as opposed to your vitality rate and all this innovation, I am just trying to see how dynamic that pro side is? Thank you very much.
Jeff Ansell: Sure. But I would say the vitality rate and the share gains are kind of one and the same. So, we are experiencing share gains highly connected to the fact that we have really strong new product vitality. So if you look at the professional power tool business in North America, which is what you asked about, we were up in every portion of that business from a corded perspective, from a low voltage perspective to a high-voltage FlexVolt perspective. And so it’s a number of things, right. So, it’s the fact that we have the largest cordless system that brings the user into it. It’s also our made in USA strategy where we are the only manufacturer of professional power tools in America. So if you add those things together, it’s driven by vitality, but there is no doubt that there is share gain and that the share gain likely impacts all the companies you just described in your question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David MacGregor: Yes, congratulations on the progress in a pretty tough environment. You guys have a lot on your plate. So I am surprised.
Jim Loree: Thank you.
David MacGregor: I guess just a question for Jeff I guess when we are obviously saw in power tools, there have been some talk about the second quarter planned channel inventory reductions around the Craftsman rollout. And I was just wondering if you could comment on how that unfolded. Was it aligned with plan? And we expect some of that will trigger into – trip into the third quarter, what are the expectations for that as well?
Jeff Ansell: Really, the short answer is I think we commented more extensively in the first quarter as those inventory levels came down for the rollout from retail perspective for the Craftsman rollout. Everything throughout the second quarter remained on track, almost exactly as we had projected, where the inventory levels kind of solidified their position, new Craftsman rolled in, POS was very positive. So, all those things were in balance and so we anticipate that to continue on for the remainder of the year kind of as we described last earnings call, but we are very pleased with the ramp and the rollout.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Megan McGrath with MKM Partners. Your line is open.
Megan McGrath: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on your commentary around cash flow and marry it with your comments that you really don’t know how long these tariffs are going to last. So, how do you think about that in terms of potential M&A? Does it make you more likely to do a domestic acquisition? Are you hesitating at all on acquisitions outside? Are valuations changing at all, maybe talk us through that a little bit.
Jim Loree: Sure. The acquisition pipeline is strong. And in several cases, there are deals that are right smack in our heartland and would strengthen some of our key franchises immensely and at the same time, we sit here today, we look at the stock price where it is and we say wow, we do tend to allocate half of our capital over a long-term basis to returning to the shareholders and we just raised the dividend, but that only accounts for something like 30% of the typical excess capital. And so there is always some room for share repurchases in that equation. And we look at our balance sheet right now, which is pretty strong and we say we have the opportunity to allocate capital at this point and so what do we do with it? And we look at these acquisitions, they come and they go over time. And as I said, the pipeline is strong and so it’s very difficult – it’s a challenging trade-off to make right now when we can buy our own stock and feel really great about it, because you can tell by the dialogue here that we are confident in our operations and our strategy and so forth in 2018 and 2019. So the way we are thinking about it right now is if the stock kind of gets some traction and starts going in the right direction again, we have the opportunity to dive into some really interesting M&A opportunities consistent with our 22/22 vision. And if we continue to languish in terms of our TSR performance, then I think stock buyback comes up front and center and we will just see what happens.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Mike Shlisky with Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Mike Shlisky: Good morning, guys.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
Mike Shlisky: So I wanted to ask quickly about Nelson Fasteners, can you guys give us sort of an update there on the timing? Do you think you will get the margins in line with the broader industrial segment by the end of this year and then next year will kind of be more of what to expect on a kind of full year basis from that one or is that more of a 2020 timeframe where you will get the margins in line for a full calendar year there?
Don Allan: Yes, good question. So, we are really pleased with the initial stages of the integration with Nelson Fasteners. It’s gone very well over the last 90 days or so and we would expect with the cost synergies and other activities and then eventually a little bit of revenue synergies playing out that by the end of next year, we will be approaching line average at that stage. And so by 2020 that full year – we will be right in line with the average for the segment. So, I think that’s the right way to think about it.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I’d now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon thanks. We would like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and thank you for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Q1 2018 Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chrystal and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Chrystal. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's first quarter 2018 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our Web-site. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don, and Jeff, will review our first quarter 2018 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
James M. Loree: Okay. Thank you, Dennis. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. As you saw in this morning's press release, we delivered a strong start to 2018. The Company posted solid revenue growth and earnings per share expansion, overcoming approximately $50 million of commodity headwinds, as we expected. Revenues were $3.2 billion, up 12%, with organic growth of 4%, acquisitions added 6 points of growth, and currency contributed 4. These factors were partially offset by the Mechanical Security divestiture, which we executed in February of last year. Tools & Storage led the way with 17% total revenue growth and with 6% organic. All major geographies and business units in Tools contributed. This performance reflects a series of growth initiatives with great commercial excellence, aligned with SFS 2.0, a healthy global pipeline of market-leading innovations, and FLEXVOLT, our first breakthrough innovation. Industrial achieved better-than-expected results with flat organic growth. The team overcame anticipated headwinds from lower project activity within Oil & Gas and declines in Engineered Fastenings, consumer electronics, and automotive systems business. Security posted total growth of 2% as bolt-on acquisitions and currency offset a 1% organic decline. EPS for the quarter was $1.39, a 7% expansion, as strong execution, acquisitions and lower expenses offset the significant impact from inflation. Don will provide you with a deeper dive into business-level operating performance during his remarks, and Jeff, as he will cover shortly, Tools' acquisitions continue to be on track and we are working diligently and successfully to complete the second half rollout of the Craftsman brand. We also executed in equity derivative transaction in the first quarter that hedges the price of a future 3.2 million share repurchase for three years through March 2021, and that supports our long-term strategy to return approximately 50% of our excess capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. So in summary, 2018 is off to a good start and looks to be another strong year as we celebrate our 175th anniversary. On that note, 175 years ago, Frederick Stanley opened the Stanley Bolt Manufactory in New Britain, Connecticut. 10 years later it was incorporated at Stanley Works, and in 2010 it was merged with Black & Decker Corporation to create Stanley Black & Decker. Frederick was quite an entrepreneur and innovator and was also very involved in the community, and that spirit of entrepreneurship, innovation, high-performance, and social responsibility, was core to who we were 175 years ago, and is alive and well today. And as you might expect, we are proud of this remarkable past and equally excited about our future as we celebrate 175 years. When Frederick Stanley founded the Company in 1843, I'm sure he could not have anticipated that his Bolt Manufactory would someday grow to a $13 billion revenue company with a market value approaching $25 billion and approximately 58,000 employees across the globe. It's a remarkable feat when you think about it and even more so when you consider that approximately 80% of the revenue growth and 90% of the market value creation has occurred since the year 2000 and just 10% of the Company's history as measured in years. We are seizing the opportunity and building on this recent growth spurt. Leveraging SFS 2.0, we are executing on a series of growth catalysts that will keep the growth coming in 2018 and beyond. FLEXVOLT has enjoyed the fastest adoption for a new product launch in power tool industry history. This high-powered innovative battery system is a growth driver today, it was in 2017, and it continues to be, and it's also stimulating demand for our 20 volt cordless offerings. We will continue to expand FLEXVOLT in the future with the ultimate goal of eliminating the need for cords on job sites, making a dramatic and positive impact on worker safety and efficiency. Moving to Craftsman, the Craftsman transaction gives us the rights to develop, manufacture, and sell Craftsman branded products in non-Sears channels. In 2017 we successfully established retail partnerships with a major home center, a major co-op hardware retailer, and a leading e-commerce player. We are working with passion and excitement to enable the iconic Craftsman brand, with its proud history to soon reclaim its rightful place in American homes, garages, factories, and automotive shops. Stay tuned for a big launch in the second half of this year. The Newell Tools integration continues to proceed on or ahead of plan and we expect to meet or exceed targeted cost synergies and are now working to capture the significant organic growth benefits associated with expanding the Lenox and Irwin brands that we acquired with that deal. And now, I'll hand it over to Don Allan, who will walk you through the segment performance, overall financial results, and 2018 guidance. Don?
Donald Allan, Jr.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Let's take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the first quarter. Starting with Tools & Storage, revenues were up 17% in the quarter, with 6% organic growth, 8 points of acquisitive growth, and 3 points of currency. Price was slightly positive as we took actions in several emerging markets. The operating margin rate was 14.3% versus 15.9% in the first quarter of 2017 as benefits of volume leverage and productivity were more than offset by anticipated commodity inflation and modest growth investments. The strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU. On a geographic basis, North America was up 3% organically, with growth across all channels. This performance included overcoming a slow start to the outdoor season due to extended winter conditions as well as planned customer inventory reductions which occurred in the retail channel ahead of the Craftsman launch. We estimate these two factors combined reduced the North American growth by approximately 3 points in the first quarter. The Craftsman transition impact was included in our plans as we prepare the marketplace to accommodate this exciting launch in the second half of the year, which you will hear more about from Jeff later in the call. The U.S. commercial and industrial markets, both generated mid-single-digit growth, and Canada contributed solid organic growth of 7%. Sharp commercial execution, new product launches, and a supportive tool market continued to fuel North America's growth. Additionally, inventories within our major North American customers remained at normal levels during the first quarter. So, in summary, both the underlying market and our performance still remains robust in North America as the two previous mentioned transitory factors are muting this region's performance for the quarter. We expect the growth to return to higher levels as we move through 2018. Now, Europe delivered another solid performance with 7% organic growth. 9 out of 10 markets grew organically, with double-digit contributions from the U.K., Iberia, Germany, and Central Europe. The team continues to set the standard for commercial excellence as they leverage our portfolio of brands, deliver a stream of innovation to the marketplace, and expand our retail relationships to produce sustained above-market organic growth. The European performance continues to be a stellar example of how to effectively apply the pillars of SFS 2.0 to drive sustained outsized organic growth. Finally, within Tools & Storage, emerging markets delivered another quarter of outstanding organic growth, up 15%, with all regions delivering great performances. Diligent pricing actions, continued e-commerce strength, and the ongoing MPP launch across the developing markets, continue to support growth. Geographically, Latin America was very strong, headlined by double-digit growth in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Peru, while Chile delivered high single-digit results. Our change to a direct selling model within Turkey and Russia continued to fuel exceptional growth for those countries. And in addition, India, Korea, and Southeast Asia, were up double-digits. Now let's shift to Tools & Storage SBUs, where both businesses showed strong growth in the quarter. The Power Tools & Equipment group was up 5% organically, led by Professional Power Tools which was up low double-digits. Partially offsetting this growth was the consumer power tool group which was down in the quarter as the previously mentioned outdoor and Craftsman transition impacted this portion of the business. The Power Tools & Equipment SBU benefited from new product introductions, reflecting market-leading core innovation as well as the expansion of the FLEXVOLT system, along with the continued sharp commercial execution. FLEXVOLT continues to perform nicely as shipments were on plan for the quarter and we saw double-digit growth in both the North American retail channel and within Europe. Our Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage SBU generated 8% organic growth [indiscernible] new product introductions, strong performances within the construction and industrial end markets, and the contribution from Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies. Hand Tools and Storage was up 6%, while Accessories delivered an outstanding 13% growth, another excellent performance from this team. So, in summary, an outstanding quarter and a strong start to the year for the Tools & Storage organization in the face of significant commodity inflation. Now, turning to Industrial, this segment delivered flat organic growth, which was better than internal expectations. Similar to the theme from Tools & Storage, operating margin rate declined year-over-year to 16.4% as productivity and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation and modest growth investments. Engineered Fastening posted flat organic growth during the quarter as strong commercial activity was able to offset the expected decline in two areas; one, automotive systems due to lower model rollover activity from our customers; and two, in the consumer electronics business. The automotive business grew mid-single-digits as continued fastener penetration gains more than offset the automotive systems decline. The fastener organic growth of high single-digit was well in excess of the 1 point decline in global light vehicle production. Additionally, the industrial fastener business continues to deliver value-added solutions to their customers, which enabled mid-single-digit organic growth in the quarter. All in all, a good start to the year for Engineered Fastening. The Infrastructure businesses posted organic decline of 1% for the quarter. Hydraulic Tools grew organically more than 20% as they continue to see the benefits from the execution of successful commercial actions as well as the support of market environment that benefits from higher scrap steel prices. Meanwhile, Oil & Gas posted a low double-digit organic decline in the quarter, as expected, given the lower pipeline project activity versus the prior year. While North American inspection project activity did provide growth, it was not enough to offset the declines in both the on and offshore pipeline businesses. And then finally, the Security segment saw a 1% organic decline in the first quarter. North America organic growth was flat as higher automatic door volume was more than offset by lower healthcare volumes. We did expect to see slightly better performance from North America but customer timing did cause a shift in inflation and project volume to future quarters in 2018. Europe organic growth was on plan, but down 2% organically, as strength in the Nordics and U.K. were offset by anticipated ongoing weakness in France. In terms of profitability, this segment declined 100 basis points year-over-year. The operating margin was impacted by targeted investments to support organic growth and the sale of the mechanical locks business which occurred last year at the end of February. The Security team remains focused on innovation with a particular emphasis on the application of digital technologies and advanced data analytics to their business model, along with commercial and operational effectiveness to position the business for sustained revenue growth and margin expansion in 2018 and beyond. I would now like to take a minute to provide some comments on commodity inflation and tariffs. The table on the left is a reminder of our direct material purchases. We continue to see elevated commodity prices and as a result now expect inflation headwinds to approximate $180 million in 2018, which is up $30 million versus our previous outlook of $150 million. Steel, batteries, and base metals are the most significant commodities generating this headwind. As you will see when we turn to guidance, we will be taking additional price, cost, and productivity actions to offset this increased inflation. Now let's shift to tariffs. First I will address steel and aluminum tariffs under Section 232, which is included in our guidance release this morning. We now expect an annual impact from these tariffs of less than $3 million. This impact has been reduced from our previous comments on this topic, as the country exclusions from Canada and Europe mitigated a majority of this potential impact. Good news on that front. As we look at our exposure for the initial 50 billion of tariffs imposed under Section 301, we estimate a maximum annual headwind of approximately $40 million to $50 million, if implemented. These tariffs could potentially impact componentry and some finished goods imported to support the U.S. market. However, there is significant uncertainty as to how this will play out, but at this stage we believe these risks are at a manageable level for our Company. We believe there are several mitigating factors which could reduce this exposure to $10 million to $30 million annually, including proactively reviewing our global supply base to identify actions at the lower cost as well as taking priced actions, clearly a number that we believe is manageable in our Company size. Please note that any impact related to the first 50 billion in Section 301 tariffs is not included in our guidance, given the uncertain nature of these tariffs and whether they even will occur. So, with that, let's head into 2018 guidance. We are reiterating our 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance which calls for approximately 5% organic growth, and adjusted earnings per share range of $8.30 to $8.50, up approximately 13% versus the prior year at the midpoint. On a GAAP basis, we now expect earnings per share to range from $7.40 up to $7.60, which is inclusive of various charges related to M&A including Nelson Fasteners, and the refinement of the one-time tax charge in the recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. Keep in mind, the regulatory guidance surrounding the new U.S. tax bill continues to be issued and our estimate will continue to be refined throughout 2018 as we receive more information. Now diving into a little more detail on our 2018 adjusted EPS outlook, you can see on the left hand side of the chart, we expect the benefits from incremental price, cost, and productivity actions, as well as the modest contribution from the Nelson Fastener Systems acquisition to generate approximately $0.15 of EPS accretion. This will however be offset by higher commodity inflation, which includes the aforementioned $180 million of expected commodity headwinds in 2018. We continue to anticipate approximately $50 million of core restructuring charges and approximately 155 million shares outstanding for 2018. And then lastly, we expect second quarter earnings to be 24% of the full-year performance. This reflects the price/cost dynamic we spoke about last quarter where we will start to realize benefits from our price increases late in the second quarter, but we will not experience – and we will not experience a significant benefit from these increases until the third quarter. Now turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, organic growth within Tools & Storage is still expected to be mid-single-digits in 2018. We believe that the generally supportive market conditions in addition to several significant organic growth catalysts support an above-market performance in Tools. The team is leveraging core innovation programs, FLEXVOLT, Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, emerging markets' growth initiative, and the rollout of the Craftsman brand in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that top line growth will translate into improved margin rate year-over-year, even with the modestly diluted impact on the Craftsman brand rollout and the elevated commodity inflation being somewhat of a governing factor in 2018. Now, in the Industrial segment we continue to expect low single-digit decline in organic growth. While the business performed above expectations in the first quarter, the market related pressures within the automotive system rollovers and the lower levels of project activity within Oil & Gas will offset nice levels of growth within other parts of this segment. With the closing of the Nelson Fastener Systems acquisition, we are revising our segment margin expectation to be down modestly year-over-year. Nelson currently carries below segment average margins, but with cost synergies we will get these margins up to line average over a reasonable period of time. Also, it is important to note, excluding this acquisition, we still expect the operating margins in Industrial to be flat to modestly positive for the year. Now finally in our Security segment, we are expecting the organic growth to be low single-digits in 2018. We continue to believe that the business can deliver a modest improvement in operating margins year-over-year as we maintain focus on cost and service productivity. We also are reiterating our free cash flow conversion rate of approximately 100%. While we didn't cover first quarter free cash flow in detail, we did show some modest pressure year-over-year. The primary driver of that pressure was higher levels of inventory in Tools & Storage to support new product launches, including Craftsman. For those that have followed us for a while, having a free cash outflow in the first quarter is relatively normal due to our working capital seasonality. Working capital management remains a key pillar of the SFS 2.0 operating system and we are confident we can continue to drive working capital improvements across the Company with a heavy focus on improving the performance of recent acquisitions. So, in summary, we believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the Company to deliver a robust 5% organic growth with 13% adjusted EPS expansion, which is overcoming approximately $180 million in commodity inflation. In addition, we remain focused on free cash flow generation, of course price realization, acquisition integrations, and the rollout of the Craftsman brand. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff to provide some comments about our Tools acquisitions and the Craftsman rollout. Jeff?
Jeffery D. Ansell: Thank you, Don. The Irwin and Lenox integrations continue to progress smoothly with cost and revenue synergies on track. We have successfully executed distribution center integrations in all regions. Notably, we completed the Irwin North America transfer into our North Carolina distribution center in February. These moves have improved service levels to the mid-90s from pre-acquisition performance in the low 80s. Additionally, we have completed warehouse migrations into our U.K. and Belgium facilities, and with several warehouse moves now complete, the vast majority of Irwin/Lenox product is now in Stanley Black & Decker facilities. From a commercial perspective, we are seeing great traction globally with the Irwin and Lenox brands. We are excited to announce an Irwin brand revitalization partnership with Bunnings, the largest home improvement retailer in Australia. In addition, we are delivering revenue synergies in global emerging markets, led by countries like Brazil and Mexico. Lenox is also generating momentum. As an example, our Lenox band saw business is up double-digits. Regarding the Craftsman integration, the legacy product lines are demonstrating growth with existing customers like Ace. In addition, we acquired Waterloo, the preeminent manufacturer of domestic metal storage products, in July of 2017, and are leveraging it to produce a full range of Craftsman made-in-the-USA metal storage products that are now ready to ship. As you could see, the acquisition integrations are proceeding nicely, with much of the remaining milestones to be completed by mid-year. Importantly, all brands, namely Irwin, Lenox, and Craftsman, delivered mid-single digit pro forma growth in Q1, consistent with our mid-single-digit core business growth. Shifting to an update on the relaunch of the Craftsman brand, we have over 1,000 new products in development for the second half 2018 rollout. To build awareness and excitement for the relaunch, we will begin to promote a portfolio of 30 Craftsman relaunch products, which includes mechanic's tool sets, portable storage, metal storage, flashlights, and more. At Lowe's, you could already see the first Craftsman relaunch items available online, and they are delivering strong performance. Additionally, there will be in-store promotional support for Father's Day. As planned, the broader set of over 1,000 Craftsman products will begin the rollout process in the second half of 2018, with completion in the first half of 2019, as planned. Ace will continue to support legacy Craftsman range until the second half of 2018, when they will begin to transition to the new Craftsman offerings, which will be completed during 2019. Ace will also participate in promotional support for Father's Day. Regarding Amazon, Craftsman metal storage products are slated to roll out in latter 2018 and our plan is to have the broader product portfolio added during 2019. While plans and projections remain on track with these customers, we continue to pursue additional channel opportunities across the globe. User and customer excitement remains high. With that said, now I'd like to turn it back to Jim to wrap up today's presentation.
James M. Loree: Thanks Jeff. That detail you just shared on Craftsman I think will really open up people's eyes as to how real this really is in the second half and how enthusiastic we are about the prospects for that. But getting back to the total Company, to recap, the first quarter was a solid start to 2018 with a 12% revenue growth, the 4% organic growth, and 7% EPS expansion, despite those commodity headwinds. And as you heard from Jeff, the Tools' acquisitions are progressing well, we are on track with Craftsman in a big way, and as Don mentioned, we are navigating successfully through the price/cost and other dynamics of 2018. And we are really fortunate to have on this call three management speakers, each of whom have 19 years of experience with this Company. And sure, we have been through all the cycles, inflationary, economic, and other, before and we know how to manage through them successfully. Thus we position the Company for a successful year and have reiterated our guidance for 2018, 5% organic growth, approximately 13% EPS growth. We are focused and remain focused on day-to-day execution, operational excellence including delivering above-market organic growth with operating leverage, successful price realization and completing the integrations of our recent acquisitions, and all the while generating strong free cash flow. And we are taking action strategically as well to continue to pursue growth looking forward as we pursue our 22/22 Vision and seek to become known as one of the world's great innovative companies to deliver top quartile financial performance and to elevate our commitment to corporate social responsibility. With that, we are now ready for Q&A. Dennis?
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Jim. Chrystal, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: I have a two-part question, if I can try to sneak you in. I guess the first one, just on Craftsman and then Lenox and Irwin, I was wondering if there is a way to maybe quantify relative to the mid-single-digit growth for the overall Tool segment this year, what you might be expecting from those three things individually or combined? And then my second is just more of a modelling question. As you look to the ramp-up of Craftsman in the back half of 2018, anything we should just keep in mind in terms of any sort of cost in the second quarter or maybe any sort of product destocking or anything like that would be helpful. Thanks.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Okay, I'll take that. This is Don. So, I'm not going to say anything specific about the impact of Craftsman throughout the year, but what I can tell you is that as we go throughout the year, and I think we talked about this back in January as well, the organic growth for Tools will improve a little bit in the second quarter versus the first quarter. So when you think about it kind of incrementally, 6% performance in Q1, you see a bit of improvement in Q2 as some of the Craftsman products start to roll out, although modestly. And then you'll start to see it improve again in the third quarter incrementally versus the second quarter. And then the fourth quarter will probably be a little bit down from the third quarter but not significantly. So, if you think about that kind of trend and how this rollout is going to work, a lot of the rollout may be more third quarter weighted than fourth quarter weighted, but we'll see how that plays out. So, think about the trend that way and a lot of that's being driven by the impact of Craftsman combined with, as a reminder, the cannibalization that has to happen during the second and third quarter as well as the fourth quarter. So there's product going in from Craftsman and there's some product coming out of some of our other brands. But I think that's the best way to think about that trend. There's no real unusual cost per se. We have baked in into our margin profile for the four quarters really the impact of this shift in products from Craftsman and we are moving some of our other brands which we have previously mentioned will have a modest dilutive impact on the Tools business in the Company from a margin perspective. You also have the dynamic of commodity inflation as I mentioned that as a result you'll see margins in Tools & Storage will be down again year-over-year in the second quarter but not as significantly down as it was in the first quarter. And as we migrate to the third quarter, you'll see some incremental year-over-year improvement in margins and then a more significant improvement in the fourth quarter as all the full pricing actions go into place. So, I think that's the best way to think about it at this stage.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Richard M. Kwas: One for Jim, one for Don; Jim, on the M&A front, recent deal in the professional space here a couple of days ago, curious on how you are thinking about incremental M&A timing, et cetera, number of opportunities, and what you think of the market? And then for Don, cadence of earnings, so first half of the year based on your Q2 guidance, low 40s as a percentage of full year. That's only below what you normally had, usually mid-40s for the first half or better. I know there's a lot of things going on here but could you just give us some feel for comfort levels around hitting these higher numbers in the second half of the year as a percentage of full year and what we should watch for?
James M. Loree: Great. Okay, I'll start with the question on M&A. I assume what you are referring to in terms of a recent transaction was the sale of Greenlee and some other tool brands to Emerson which was announced this week for $810 million. It's probably the first tool transaction in a long time that we haven't actually closed on. So, I appreciate the question. I can tell you that we think Greenlee is a good asset with a certain value. When we got into the process of looking at it, the value, given some other attributes of the particular asset, of $810 was just a bit more than we had an appetite for. So, very, very good asset and we wish Emerson all the best with that, we don't have to own everything, but we are very disciplined when it comes to value, price, et cetera, on these types of things. Pipeline itself is very good, very good, and our digestion of what we have already acquired is going well. So, you can only imagine that sometime in the not-too-distant future you will continue to see acquisitions from Stanley Black & Decker, and as we said in the past, you can potentially see those anywhere in the portfolio because we really believe that if we own an asset or we own a particular business and it's part of the portfolio, then that should indicate that we should be willing to invest capital in it because it has a future and a bright future. So, pipeline is robust and we are selective though, and I think that Greenlee is a good indication of that discipline.
Donald Allan, Jr.: And on the second question related to the first half/second half, which is a very good question to ask, and clearly this year is a little bit different from a profile view, and when you think about really two factors that are driving that. The first half of the year will have roughly 40% to 41% of our full-year EPS performance in the first half. Historically it's probably closer to 45%. So that's roughly $0.35 to $0.40 of EPS that's shifting. The biggest driver is commodity inflation. And so, we have significant commodity inflation. Jim mentioned $50 million in the first quarter, really no price recovery on that $50 million of any significance. We'll have some partial recovery in the second quarter, but still we'll have a significant component of it that will not be recovered. And then you have the added dynamic of the Craftsman rollout in the back half where you're getting a nice benefit of that rollout not only on the organic line but also in dollars of OM and in EPS. So it's really those two factors that are driving first half versus second half when you compare it to our traditional trend. And we are very confident in our pricing actions that we have laid out there. We have really two ways of them. We had 150 million of commodity inflation that we started the year. We said back in January that about 60% to 70% of that would be recovered in the year. We still feel good about that. So that's roughly $100 million of recovery that starts to be implemented in the second quarter and fully executed in the third quarter. Now there is a new wave of 30 million of commodity inflation that's happening, and we still feel the same about recovery. We actually think we can get 60% to 70% of that in 2018. However, those actions won't begin to be implemented until sometime in the mid to second stage of the third quarter. And we feel pretty confident in our ability to do that because we've been focused on different surgical things that we can do in the area of pricing. As we mentioned before, these usually are not broad-based price increases. Occasionally we do that to certain categories where we think it's appropriate, but the vast majority of this price increase across the Company is more surgical where we see opportunity because of the inflation but we see opportunity because of our pricing versus our competitors.
James M. Loree: And I'd like to make an additional comment on pricing because there is a lot of discussion surrounding pricing and whether we have pricing power in some of our industries, et cetera, and the reality is, when inflation is incremental and very modest but significant, it is somewhat difficult to get price in some of our markets because there isn't a significant story to go to the customers with and the channels with. When we get big slugs of inflation, like we've got this year, those conversations aren't easy but they are successful in general because it's just the reality of the situation. We are in business to make money and in order to do that we have to achieve price increases to offset some of that inflation. And I think the other thing to mention is that every year we generate 3% to 4% productivity very reliably. And so, to the extent that price does not necessarily cover all of the inflation, it is still possible to have margin accretion in this business because of the productivity that we consistently generate as a result of SFS 2.0 and other activities that we are pursuing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Mike Rehaut: I'm going to stick to actually one question, as you asked at the beginning of the call. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about Nelson and give us a little bit of sense to how that fits into the portfolio. It seems like in terms of the $0.15 offset to the commodity inflation that the acquisition accretion, seems like it's a slight, is a minority of that $0.15 given, Don, you said 60% to 70% of the 30 million could be offset this year through price. So I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly. And just more broadly, as you talk about Nelson, maybe you can also talk about the broader M&A pipeline and how that fits across the Company as well.
Donald Allan, Jr.: So, we actually like the Nelson Fastener acquisition. Obviously we think it's a great addition to our industrial fastener business. So, within Engineered Fastening, we have the automotive piece and we have industrial fasteners. This fits very well to that particular part of the business and it brings some nice additional products and technology that really is a great addition to that particular business. So, a great addition to the portfolio, a continued expansion of really our niche expertise within fasteners that we can add value to our customers. On your question related to the accretion and the impact from Nelson, it is modest, and so the bulk of the positive accretion of that $0.15 is coming from price. The next significant piece is a little bit of productivity and other cost actions. And then the smaller piece or the third piece of it is the Nelson contribution, because we do have interest cost associated with funding it and obviously we do have intangible costs as well. So, in particular in the first year, it really offsets a lot of the OM accretion that we're going to experience with that business, but as we go into next year, we'll see a nice uplift from that.
James M. Loree: Yes, keeping in mind that it's basically a $200 million revenue bolt-on acquisition, it does not have a dramatic impact.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Winoker from UBS. Your line is open.
Chris: This is Chris. So, I just kind of want to dig into Craftsman a little bit again. So with regard to Craftsman, the original expectation was for about $100 million of incremental sales each year from that business. And as I understand, the distribution through Ace Hardware is already achieving that sales number. So, how should we expect this number to change as you kind of filter Lowe's and Amazon through? Does the Ace piece kind of go away or does that cannibalization of other product that you guys are taking off the shelf offset that? And then just kind of part of this is just in terms of margin, like where are we, like what inning are we in, in terms of like the margin improvement of that business?
James M. Loree: I'll have Don answer the margin part of the question, but I would start by saying that when we acquired Craftsman, the assumptions that we utilized were based on a fair amount of uncertainty as it relates to how the commercial conversations would go with customers. We had a sense that they would be positive, but a sense that they would be positive versus actually having an agreement, there is a pretty wide kind of variability between those two things. And as I think most people have gleamed by now, the conversations have materialized into some pretty good results for the commercial agreements. And therefore, I guess going back to when we gave the guidance and the parameters for what we expected, we said it would be a billion-dollar deal but it would take 10 years. With all that uncertainty, obviously we were very cautious and careful in terms of the timeframe. You can all come to your own conclusions about how that timeframe might be changing because the success of the conversations have gone so well. From our perspective, it's premature to change what we've said previously, but I can assure you that the directional aspects of this are favorable, and there will be more granularity coming out as the programs develop.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yes, just a reminder, back in January I made the comment that as we go through the year and probably in the back half of the year, we'll give a little better sense of how we think that program is going to play out in light of what Jim just said. On the margin side, yes, the margins of Craftsman, as we said, are below line average and that's something that we recognize. We think through the things that we're going to do related to innovation and then bringing in the products in our manufacturing system, but I'll ask Jeff to give you a little more color on that particular program and how that's proceeding in our plan over the next three years. However, it's beginning in a situation that will be pressured to our margin. However, we do believe because of the size of our business, our Tools & Storage business, that over the time horizon we will continue to be able to grow margins even with that pressure and that [indiscernible] have any impact here in 2018 and likely in 2019 as well, but innovation will help us improve the margins and then the manufacturing strategy as well, and I think Jeff can give us a little more color on what our manufacturing strategy is and the status of that.
James M. Loree: Yes, but just for clarity, on the margins we're talking specifically about margin rate, and the margin dollars will be significantly [indiscernible].
Jeffery D. Ansell: Thanks Don. In terms of manufacturing strategy around Craftsman, so we acquired an existing legacy business that had existing legacy products. The launch that begins this second quarter promotionally across Lowe's, across [indiscernible], and then replicate it promotionally with both of those customers and with Amazon in the fourth quarter, those will be relaunch products, ground-up Stanley designed, Stanley manufactured products, and so far it's going really well, 1,000 products in development, but 30 of those products are manufactured at this point, but they include products that we are really good at manufacturing. So, hand tools manufactured in the United States, metal storage products and plastic storage products manufactured in the United States, power tools manufactured in the United States. So, all of those things look really promising and rollout plans look really good. We will improve the margins from what we acquired. The legacy margins of Craftsman were much worse. But as Jim and Don said, in the early stages they will be dilutive to our line average margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Could you comment on the competitive landscape in Security for a moment? ADT seems to be moving more in the commercial. Maybe that's different niches or different target areas than what you have, but did you see any change in commercial security yet and is there any sort of separation between what you might see them doing and what you do?
James M. Loree: I would say the change has been occurring over a longer period of time and the competitive intensity has gradually increased. But in terms of short-term changes, it's pretty much business as usual in the commercial industry. The industry still remains incredibly fragmented despite the fact that we have a very large, one very large player and another one that's increasingly getting into commercial. So, nothing really notable there. I think there is a more strategic issue that we're dealing with and we'll deal with as we go forward, which is how do we reshape the value proposition of the business to make it even more differentiated than it is today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Wood from Nomura. Your line is open.
Mike Wood: Wanted to ask you about price recovery from the commodity inflation, can you just give us a sense, historically how large productivity typically plays a role in keeping price cost neutral or do you eventually recover the commodity inflation with price alone just with the lag? Thank you.
Donald Allan, Jr.: So, I'll take that. As we look at history, inflationary times, the 60% to 70% that I mentioned for this year in 2018 is actually consistent with history in the first year. Then we obviously have a carryover effect into the next year of that impact. I would say that we never really fully recover all the commodity inflation, but we get pretty close, maybe 90% recovery when you look at it over a two-year period of time, maybe 2.5 to 3 years depending on the cycle that you are going through. And so, history would say that that's probably what's going to happen and I think what we're doing here in 2018 and 2019 probably be very similar to that. Productivity is something allows us to offset that 30% or so or 35% that we have in the first year, then anything remaining, 10% or so, that occurs in the subsequent year over that two-year time horizon, we utilize that. I mean, our productivity continues to be significant and it's something that we drive throughout our supply chain on an annual basis, as Jim mentioned.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.
Jason Makishi: This is actually Jason Makishi on for Julian. Just to the scope of that $180 million inflation guide, just wanted to check to see in the context of the visibility that you typically have particularly in Tools & Storage around price cost dynamics, if there was scope for that maybe to come up as commodity inflation persists. And then on the other end of that, what would the incremental price actions look like and would those be sort of difficult to push through just given the number that is already planned for?
James M. Loree: I mean the bottom line is, we are confident in getting the price level that we've talked about, and the expectation that we would get more is probably unrealistic and that productivity will do the job that we have talked about. So, I wouldn't bet on more price percentage recovery than has already been indicated, but if more inflation comes, you can stand confident that we will continue to offset that in proportion to previous recovery increases that we have talked about.
Donald Allan, Jr.: And just a reminder, we haven't had an inflationary cycle like this in quite some time. But if you do look at our history and you want to go back that far, you will see that our approach that we are taking this year is very, very similar to what we've done in the past. And we believe given where we stand in the market with the brands that we have and the products that we have and the innovation associated with that, we have the ability to take these actions and be successful because we do it, as I described earlier, in a surgical way, in a way that we really can be targeted to where it makes sense to do versus doing broad-based price increases.
James M. Loree: Yes, and I would say the linkage also between our supply management organization and our commercial organizations in terms of understanding what the impact is as it's happening in real time, making that connection with the commercial organization and coming up with tactics in the strategy and the tactics that are required to recover the price with the help of the financial organization, I think is a very tight process here and one that's been refined, as I mentioned, over the years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Robert Barry: I had a question on Industrial actually, and then maybe just a quick Mechanical question. So you still see low single-digit decline there. I thought most of the pressure was expected in 1Q. That came in much better. So I'm just curious where the pressure is going forward. Maybe you could give us some color on what's expected for the components within Industrial. And then just a quick question on this capped call transaction, just curious, it's a little atypical why you kind of chose to do the repose that way. Thanks.
James M. Loree: Actually I'll take the capped call question and then Don will answer the Industrial question to the extent possible. But the opportunity at this level to lock-in what we view as a very favorable share repurchase price was something that we elected to take because we really feel that the future of the Company is very bright, and therefore locking in at today's levels is a sensible thing to do. Now why did we not just buy the stock, I guess is the question with that as the context. And the answer is, I mentioned earlier the M&A pipeline is fairly robust. So, when we make trade-offs between should we buy a very, very significant quantity of stock at this moment or should we lock in the price and wait to buy it in the future because we have a few things in the M&A pipeline that might come to fruition, all that goes into the thought process that ended up in the result of doing what we did with respect to the derivative.
Donald Allan, Jr.: And I would just add that a capped call, based on what Jim just said, really gives us a lot of flexibility and that's the benefit of doing something like that at what we would view as a very reasonable price. So, on the Industrial question, there's two factors driving our view of the segment for the full year. The automotive systems impact will be ongoing throughout the year. So that will be a pressure to Engineered Fastening that might subside in the fourth quarter, but it's likely to continue throughout the entire year. And then the second dynamic is Oil & Gas. As I mentioned in my commentary, we continue to see low level of activities associated with pipeline construction, and as a result we expect pressure to their business year-over-year. As they saw a really nice performance last year, certain pipelines were constructed here in the U.S. or North America. We don't see the same level of activity right now. So, there's those two large dynamics that are driving that throughout the remainder of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David MacGregor: A couple of questions quickly on the emerging markets business, you have put up some mid-teens growth in Tools, which was pretty impressive. I guess, how should we think about the pace of growth over the next year or two given the new products, the e-commerce penetration, and the expanding distribution? And also, how should we think about the incremental profitability of that incremental emerging market business?
James M. Loree: The emerging markets is a major growth theme for us. It's something that we have invested heavily in over the last three or four years, something we have developed strategies for the emerging markets that involve several elements, including expanding our feet on the street, beefing up our management structure, undertaking some pretty significant product development over time to create MPP products and hand tools, corded power tools and cordless power tools, and just all-in-all really taking SFS 2.0 and driving it into the emerging market world and with great success, some of which has been masked over the past few years by massive foreign exchange headwinds that we've had which totaled hundreds of millions of dollars over the past four years and have now subsided. So, now what you're seeing I think is the confluence of all those operational things that I talked about as well as the abatement of the FX headwinds, and the growth is excellent. The market share increases are taking place. It is almost pervasive across most of the emerging markets. There's a few areas that we are still kind of working to get to perfect the equation, but all in all it's a great story and it's something that I appreciate you asking the question because we don't talk that much about it, but I think you'll find that that will fuel growth here in the future. As far as the margins, the gross margins are surprisingly consistent with the line average. The operating margin tends to be just a little bit lower because we are investing heavily in what I talked about. So, to the extent that we invested a little less heavily, which we have the flexibility to do if and when we want to do that, the operating margins will be very consistent with the line average. In the meantime, we are investing in growth.
Operator: And our final question comes from Scott Rednor from Zelman. Your line is open.
Scott Rednor: I was hoping you could talk about the outdoor business. Don, I think in prior conferences or calls you described it as maybe a $300 million business. So, could you maybe just conceptualize how that would phase I guess through the year and if you guys are seeing it come back in April at all?
Jeffery D. Ansell: This is Jeff. I'll take the question. The outdoor business for us is just a little less than 5% of the total Tools business, obviously seasonal. So, we did see pressure in that business in the first three months of the year, probably like every company that participates there, based on weather pattern. So, what we thought was the coldest March in four years and it comps against what was a pretty good first quarter last year for most seasonal companies. So, with that said, our listings remained very good, lot of addition, so new Black & Decker innovative items as well as new DEWALT innovative items. So the placements looked quite good. We do expect it to come back in the second quarter. What you do tend to find with outdoor is that just because of the compact nature of the season, it doesn't come back 100%, there's just not enough time for that to happen. So, we do expect some recovery in the second quarter in the guidance we have provided, not a full recovery, but again, it is a relatively small percentage of the total business, and we continue to do quite well in that area.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for any closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Chrystal, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Full Year 2017 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to on the call, are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don, and Jeff will review our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
Jim Loree: Thanks Dennis and good morning everyone, thank you for joining us. As you saw in this morning’s press release, we delivered a solid fourth quarter performance bringing closure to an impressive 2017. The company continued is above-market organic growth trajectory and developed operating margin rate expansion, strong EPS growth and very good free cash flow conversion. This solid performance highlight the power of coupling our very developed organic growth machine with a return to acquisitions. We are encouraged and we believe that this trend will continue in to 2018.  Moving to the fourth quarter numbers, revenues were 3.4 billion, up 17%, with organic growth of 8%. Acquisitions added 9 points of growth and currency contributed 3 points. These factors were partially offset by the mechanical security divestiture. Tools and storage continued its strong contribution accelerating to 11% organic growth and 26% total growth.  With strength in all major geographies and business units, this performance reflects a vibrant series of growth initiatives around the globe and a stream of innovations that we have brought to the market place including FlexVolt.  As expected, industrial decelerated in the quarter to a still positive 2% organic, just ahead of our expectations. All three industrial businesses delivered growth in the fourth quarter, which was enough to more than offset anticipated declines in engineered fastening electronics business, as well as lower self-piercing rivet system sales.  Security ended the year with 2% organic growth including modestly positive performances from both Europe and North America and Don will provide you with a deeper dive in to business level operating performance during his remarks.  Our total company operating margin rate excluding M&A related charges remained healthy and expanded 30 basis points versus prior year. EPS for the quarter was $2.18, a 27% expansion as strong operational execution was coupled with lower restructuring cost. Also noteworthy, we reached agreement in late December to purchase the industrial focused business of Nelson Fastener Systems for $440 million in cash.  The agreement excludes Nelson’s automotive stud welding business and is a write down to fairway bolton for engineered fastening. Nelson increases our presence and the general and industrial end market expands our portfolio of highly engineered fastening solutions and will deliver significant cost synergies relative to its size.  Nelson’s LTM revenues were approximately 200 million. The company employs about 700 people and operates 11 manufacturing sites. We expect that transaction to close in the first half of 2018 and look forward to integrating Nelson and adding scale and capabilities to engineered fastening.  Now let’s turn to full year highlights, 2017 was a year of impressive financial performance, strong execution, and progress towards our strategic objectives our 2022 vision. Full year revenues were 12.7 billion, up 12% including a 7% contribution for organic growth, as well as a 7% contribution from acquisitions.  Our operating margin rate expanded 40 basis points to a record 14.8%. Productivity and cost reduction initiatives supported a 40 basis point expansion in gross margin despite nearly a $100 million of currency and commodity headwinds.  2017 was a case study of SFS 2.0 in action, innovation, commercial excellence and digital excellence fueled above market growth and margin expansion. That growth along with cost and asset efficiency from functional transformation and fuller SFS enabled us to continue to make targeted investments to support future innovation, growth and margin expansion, all-in-all a highly virtuous circle. Ex charges, diluted EPS for the year was $7.45, a 14% increase and a new record for Stanley Black & Decker. Free cash flow remained robust at 976 million and cash conversion came in at our target of approximately 100%.  Turning to portfolio strategy, 2017 was a year in which we executed several significant portfolio moves. The year began with a $725 million tax efficient mechanical security divestiture which was followed by the acquisitions of the Craftsman Brand and Newell Tools, which combined, totaled approximately $2.9 billion. In doing so we added three iconic brands, Lenox, Irwin and Craftsman, with a far greater future growth potential. Specific to Newell Tools, we continue to execute plans to integrate employees, suppliers and customers in to operations. We remain focused on and confident in our ability to capture the $80 million to $90 of cost synergies.  Our commercial teams continue to refine plans to pursue revenue synergies as well. In that regard we will move to global execution mode this year and begin to drive meaningful results in that area.  And turning to Craftsman, we continue to make great progress on product development, supply chain deployment and commercial strategy. The Tools & Storage folks along with our customers are in full bore execution mode of internally and with our partners and are confident that the mid-2018 rollout will be a successful relaunch of this incredibly strong brand, and additionally we made further substantive progress on the commercial strategy. And Jeff Ansell will provide some more color on that in just a few moments.  So as you can see, we remain on or ahead of our plans, as it relates to the integrations. In summary, 2017 was a really great year for Stanley Black & Decker. What a special performance by our 57,000 employees around the globe. I thank them for their dedication, agility and a will to win. Because it is our people to whom we attribute these great accomplishments. They live our purpose everyday with incredible passion.  2018 looks to be shaping up to be another strong year, as we celebrate our 175th year in business on a high note. We have generally supportive market conditions, with a few minor exceptions with in industrial, a strong pipeline of acquisitions, and organic growth initiatives developed in accordance with SFS 2.0.  We have a cost and productivity focus that supports margin expansion and is the bedrock of our operating system as well as a host of new opportunities related to our innovation activities. And as always we have to navigate known headwinds such as commodity inflation and other unknown pressures that may arise.  We feel that we position the company for a successful 2018 nonetheless. And now I will hand it over to Don Allan, who’ll walk you through segment performance, overall financials, and 2018 guidance. Don?
Don Allan: Thank you Jim and good morning everyone. I will now take a deeper dive in to our business segment results for the fourth quarter. Starting with Tools & Storage, revenue were up 26% in the quarter, with an impressive 11% organic growth, 13 points of acquisitive growth, and 2 points of currency. The operating margin rate for this segment was robust ta 16.7% as benefits of volume leverage and productivity more than offset growth investments, commodity inflation and price to support normal holiday promotion, yielding a 50 basis points expansion versus prior year.  A strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and [SBUs]. On a geographic basis, North America was 8% organically, with strong performances across all channels. The US commercial market generated double-digit growth, US retail channels close to high single digit growth, and their industrial and auto repair markets generated mid-single digit growth. Additionally Canada contributed solid organic growth of 8%.  North America’s growth continue to be fueled by strong commercial execution and product introduction across the portfolio, including contributions from FlexVolt. We continue to see very little cannibalization impacts from both FlexVolt launch, and are seeing more positive indication that this is stimulating incremental demand for our DeWalt 20 volt cordless power tool system, while also not competing growth in corded products. Our shipments continue to be supported by strong demand in that channel, as North America POS was up mid-single digits and inventories within our major customers were also in line with prior year levels. Europe delivered another outstanding performance with 17% organic growth. 10 out of 10 markets grew organically with double digits performances in eight of the markets including the UK, France, Siberia, and Central Europe.  The team continues to leverage our portfolio of brands and expand on our retail relationships to introduce sustained above market organic growth. This performance exceeded our recent trend in mid-to-high single digit performances, as the region benefited from a strong holiday season.  Finally, emerging markets delivered in other center an outstanding organic growth of 17%, with all regions delivering double digit performances. Diligent pricing actions, continued e-commerce strength, and the ongoing [NPG] launch across the developing markets continue to support growth.  Geographically, Latin America was very strong, headlined by double digit growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, while Peru and Chile delivered high single digit results. Our change to a direct selling model within Turkey and Russia continued to fuel exceptional growth for those countries. In addition, Korean, Japan, Indian and China posted notable double digit growth.  Within the Tools & Storage SPUs all lines showed high single to double digit growth in the quarter. The Power Tool and Equipment group was 13% organically, whereby professional Power and Tool at 15%. This SPU also benefited from new product introductions reflecting core innovations as well as (inaudible), along with continued strong commercial execution.  Our hand tools, accessories and storage organization generated 9% across our new product introductions and strong performances within the construction and industrial and markets. The accessories segment was up 14%, while hand tools and storage delivered 8% growth. Another nice performance from this team, while they are also successfully continuing to integrate Lenox, Irwin and the Craftsman brand.  So, in summary, truly an outstanding quarter and an outstanding year for the tools and storage organization. Jeff will provide some additional color on the full year in a few minutes.  Turning to industrial, this segment delivered 2% organic growth as Jim mentioned, slightly ahead of internal expectations. This topline performance contributed to an 80 basis points expansion in operating margin rate from volume leverage, productivity and cost control. Engineered fastening posted 1% organic growth during the quarter, with mid-single digit growth in automotive and industrial, which more than offset lower electronics volume.  Within automotive, growth was led by continued penetration gains within fasteners, enabling organic growth well in access of light vehicle production. This more than offset the expected impact of lower self-piercing rivet system sales due to lower model rollover activity at our automotive customers.  Finally, the growth within general industrial fastener market reflected supported market conditions and enhanced commercial actions, and they won share gain within our customer base. The infrastructure businesses posted a strong quarter of 8% organic growth, hydraulic tools grew 19% as they continue to see the benefits from the execution of successful commercial actions as well as the support of market environment. This team continues to raise the bar for commercial excellence as all regions contributed to growth.  Meanwhile, oil and gas generated 3% organic growth in the quarter, driven by North America auto wells and inspection projects activities which more than offset a continued and expected decline in offshore project activity.  The North American inspection business has been a relatively new driver for organic growth and our performance for oil and gas. The teams commercial have grown this business from approximately 15 million in 2016 to nearly 50 million this year.  Finally, the security segment delivered 2% organic growth during the quarter. North America organic growth was up 2% due to higher installation activity within conversion, security systems and higher product volumes within healthcare. Europe’s organic growth was up 1% that strengthen the Nordic and UK was offset by anticipated ongoing weakness in France.  In terms of profitability the segment declined 200 basis points year-over-year. The sale of the mechanical lock business drove approximately 90 basis points of this contraction. The remaining 110 basis points decline was attributable to mix and modest levels of investment to support long term growth. The mix impact came about due to higher mix of installation revenues within CSS, lower software sales within healthcare and then [country mix] within Europe.  It is important note, that this operating margin was consistent with the performance of the business over the last two quarters. Security team remained focused on innovation along with commercial and operational effectiveness to position the business for revenue growth and margin expansion in 2018. Let’s take a look at free cash flow performance on the next page. In addition to the strong P&L performance, we were able to drive significant working capital improvements during the quarter. Our full year cash flow performance was strong as we generated 967 million in 2016-17.  First in 2016, cash from operations declined 66 million, however this included a $261 million investment in working capital, which was $318 million higher than 2016 to support the strong, very strong level of organic growth, most notably within tools and storage. This impact was partially offset by higher cash earnings from the business.  In addition we saw our capital expenditures increase by 96 million in 2017, as we made investments to expand our manufacturing and distribution capacity, as well as investments to support acquisition integrations. This performance resulted in a free cash flow as a percentage of net income to be approximately a 100% when excluding the net gain on divestitures right in line with our stated financial objectives. On a working capital term perspective, we delivered 8.9 turns in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 1.7 turns versus the prior year. This decline reflects the impact of our recent portfolio activity, specifically the acquisition of both Lenox, Irwin and Craftsman brand. Excluding these acquisitions, turns were 10.6 times, consistent with our record 2016 performance.  Working capital management remains a key pillar SFS 2.0 operating system. We continue to drive working capital improvements across the company, with heavy focus on improving the performance of our recent acquisitions such as Newell Tools. We are confident in our ability to now bring our working capital turns back about 10 in the coming years.  I would now like to take a minute to provide some comments regarding the recently enacted US tax legislation and its respected impact to the fourth quarter 2017 and fully year of 2018. We expect these changes to deliver a positive impact for the US economy and are very supportive of the improved worldwide cash mobility that comes with the territorial tax system, and finally encouraged by the benefits that come from the lower effective tax rate.  In the fourth quarter, we recorded a one-time $24 million net tax charge which is reflected in our GAAP EPS. This includes an estimated liability of $466 million to reflect the new territorial tool charge. As you know, this is payable over the course of eight years heavily weighted to 2022 and beyond.  Partially offsetting this is the positive impact from re-measuring our net deferred tax liability positions at these lower tax rates. Keep in mind the regulatory guidance surrounding this new tax bill continues to be refined and the fourth quarter charge is based on current estimates. We finalize the overall impact during 2018 as we receive refined guidance from the US Treasury Department.  Now turning to the impact of the 2018 effective tax rate. The full benefit of the decrease in the US tax rate from 35% to 21% is estimated to be approximately five points on our effective tax rate. This benefit however is mitigated by approximately three points of tax costs on certain new provisions in the tax law as well as reduced benefits from previously allowed deductions.  Our guidance for 2018 will be based on the tax rate of approximately 18%, which is a $0.20 EPS benefit versus 2017. Hence the overall estimated impact from the new legislation is a two point benefit to our effective tax rate in 2018.  Now let’s move deeper in to our 2018 guidance. Before I start this outlook is based on the first quarter adoption of two new accounting standards with respect to revenue recognition and pension accounting. For financial modelling purposes, we released a supplementary 8K this morning to provide the impacts of operating results and business segment information for 2016 and 2017. The impacts from these changes has a modest negative impact on our operating margin rates and is relatively neutral to EPS. We are targeting approximately 5% organic growth in 2018 which will result in an adjusted earnings per share range of $8.30 up to $8.50, which is an increase of approximately 13% versus the prior year at the mid-point, and we expect our free cash flow conversion to approximate a 100% again in 2018. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $7.80 up to $8, inclusive of various one-time charges related to M&A. You can see on the left side of this chart, we expect the benefits from organic growth to generate $0.50 to $0.60 of EPS accretion. This will be partially offset from $0.25 to $0.30 of net commodity inflation which includes approximately 150 million of commodity pressure, which will be offset by the impact from pricing actions that will begin to be reflected in the P&L as we move in to later stages of the second quarter. Across the full year this reflects a 60% to 70% price recovery.  Next we expect the net impacts of cost and productivity actions, acquisition accretion and a higher share count year-over-year to deliver a positive $0.45 to $0.50 in EPS. As previously mentioned, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% and 80% which will deliver as I mentioned $0.20 in EPS secretion.  A few other housekeeping items I’d like to review that we referred to other miscellaneous guided matters. The first of which we continue to anticipate approximately 50 million of core restructuring charges, which is consistent with the last few years. Second, we are forecasting approximately 155 million share outstanding for 2018. Finally, we expect the first quarter’s earnings to be approximately 16% of the full year performance. This is about 130 basis points lower than last year.  The primary factor driving a lower percentage of full year delivery is that we continue to expect elevated levels of commodity inflation particularly in tools, but do not expect to see the price recovery benefit until we get in to the later stages of the second quarter and beyond. The net priced cost headwind for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $50 million. This impact is somewhat mitigated by lower below the line expenses year-over-year, due to one-time environment and pension charges that were taken in the first quarter of last year.  Now let’s turn to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. Organic growth within Tools & Storage is expected to be mid-single digit in 2018. There are multiple organic growth catalyst including core innovation, continued benefit from flex fold, the start of Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, emerging market growth and perhaps most exciting, the Craftsman Brand roll out in the second half of the year.  Another positive factor is that we are generally seeing supportive markets across most geographies that we serve. We believe the topline growth will translate in to margin rate year-over-year. As many of you know the rollout of the Craftsman brand will have somewhat of a governing factor on how far we can push margins forward in tools next year, as it will begin at the low line average profitability. This dynamic is due to heavily relying on our outsource providers as we ramp up in the market place and overtime we will improve profitability as we enforce production.  In the industrial segment, we expect low single digit decline in organic growth, with an easier fastening expect to see relatively flat organic performance. We will see above market growth within automotive and industrial fasteners, but that will be offset by lower automotive system sales due to a decline in model rollovers at our automotive customers, and the residual comp issues within electronics most notably in 1Q. In oil and gas we expect to see a double digit decline due to lower onshore project activity across the pipeline market. And then within hydraulic tools we expect to see continued growth from our successful commercial action. With the teams proactive cost and productivity focused, we expect industrial operating margins to improve in this segment for the year.  Finally in the security segment, we are expecting the organic to be up low single digits in 2018, as the team continues the commercial momentum from 2017. This should translate in to improved operating margins year-over-year, as we drive our cost and service productivity focus.  So in summary, we believe that we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company’s earnings growth and margin expansion in 2018, which is consistent with our long term financial targets. We remain focused on free cash flow generation, acquisition, integrations and the rollout of the Craftsman Brand. So as you can see there’s a lot to be excited about in 2018.  With that I would like to turn the call over to Jeff for a few key full year Tools & Storage highlights and then a brief update regarding (inaudible).
Jeff Ansell: Thank you Don. 2017 was a special year for our Tools & Storage business, including expansion of operating margins, while delivering 9% organic growth and 19% total growth. This translates to $1.4 billion in growth with approximately half coming from organic initiatives and half from acquisitions, an accomplishment that used to take years rather than months to achieve.  We delivered market leading innovation, quality, and commercial excellence, and as such we are recognized with vendor awards from the largest customers across every channel and every geography. We expanded our exclusive FlexVolt system which offers the user the power of corded with the freedom of cordless. This innovation spearheaded and accelerated dual growth across corded products, 20 volt cordless products and across the FlexVolt range itself.  The Volt was the only provider with growth across corded products as well as low and high voltage cordless products concurrently. Our stable of brands continued to perform well on a global basis. With Stanley Black & Decker, MAC Tools all up single digits, while [Turdo], Vidmar and DeWALT all expanded double digits. All of this occurred in consort with a successful integration of our second and fourth largest acquisition in our history, namely Irwin, Lenox, and Craftsman.  To close the book on 2017, we delivered growth across every region, every channel, every strategic business unit and with all of our top customers. We integrated a complex carve-out in dual tools and build Craftsman from the ground up, all concurrent with delivery of our largest organic growth year in history.  Looking to 2018 and as I Jim mentioned earlier, I’m also pleased to provide an update on our plans for the Craftsman brand going forward. During our October earnings call, we provided an update on the development of our Craftsman distribution strategy. That update included confirmation that Ace, we’d support Craftsman across the hardware channel, and Lowes would support Craftsman across the home center channel. As we continue to develop and fine tune the strategy, we are pleased to confirm that we will also make Craftsman available via Amazon. With support from leading companies like Lowes, Ace and Amazon, we expect to make Craftsman available to far more users than any time in its 90 year history. Overall the support of the iconic Craftsman brand today is overwhelming.  Now I will turn the call back to Jim to wrap up today’s presentation. 
Jim Loree: Thanks Jeff and great year, lots of exciting news and for the total company in summary 2017 was another strong year of execution and financial performance. And just to reflect one last time, 7% organic growth, 7% contribution from acquisitions, a 40 basis points expansion in operating margin rate, a record 14.8% and 14% EPS expansion.  We reshaped the portfolio with divestiture with mechanical security, purchase of new tools and the Craftsman brand and these transaction as Jeff said are on track and some of the exciting benefits from them are just on the horizon. And ’18 is shaping up to be another strong year with 5% organic growth, 11% to 14% EPS growth and we are encouraged by the many, many organic growth catalyst across the company catalyzed by SFS 2.0 and a great execution team and also arising through our recent acquisitions.  And I’d like to thank my senior management team, our 57,000 associates and all our stakeholders including the investment community for your strong support as I reflect back on 2017, my first full year as CEO. Our deep and agile leadership team along with our entire employee base remains focused, committed and supportive as we tackle 2018 to deliver strong, above market organic growth, with operating leverage and continue to successfully integrate these acquisitions and generate strong free cash flow.  And additionally, we are energized, our team is energized by our company’s purpose for those who make the world to achieve our 2022 vision and to strife to become known as one of the world’s leading innovators to deliver top quartile financial performance and to elevate our commitment support with social responsibility. And Dennis we are now ready for Q&A.
Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Jim. Shannon we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin. 
Rich Kwas: Jim on Craftsman first of all, can you shed any light on timing. How we should think about this as the rollout in terms of timing. And then second, Don I didn’t see anything with regards to FX assumptions within the guidance and then which are comfort level with commodity cost at 150 that’s unchanged from what you talked about November and metals prices have gone up here recently, so just some additional thoughts there. Thanks. 
Jim Loree: On Craftsman there’s a lot of variables on Craftsman. It’s interesting when you think about Craftsman, we brought a brand and maybe like three people along with it, and the work that the team has been doing and consumed for the last year or so is an incredible execution project, multi-dimensional etcetera. The relationships as Jeff pointed out are going extremely well. On the commercial side, the supply chain is going extremely well and frankly we are super excited about it, as I am sure you can appreciate it. As for timing I’m going ask Jeff to comment on that, because he’s managing all these, juggling all these cause at the same time here. And I’ll turn it over to you for a moment there Jeff on that one. 
Jeff Ansell: Thanks Jim. The answer to the question, we’ve built a dedicated Craftsman team and split them up so that the core business continues to accelerate even while we build Craftsman from the ground up. So we are developing all the new products to go with the brand that we acquired, and until that is complete we really can’t affectively do capacity planning, which is just beginning as we speak.  While we are committed to launching Craftsman in the second half of the year, customer roll-on plans will be dependent on completion of the customer demand plans along with our capacity plans to ensure supply. As stated earlier the support of this iconic brand is overwhelming, and our teams engage to support as much demand as soon as possible. However, we’re just clear at this point that we will have greater demand than supply in 2018. 
Jim Loree: I’ll take the second question that Rich tuck in there. On the commodity side of 150 million at this stage that would be representative of current prices. But our view is that would impact our P&L. We’re like always we do contingency planning and we’re focused on if another 30 million or 50 million of commodity inflation came our way, how would we react. So that is factored in to our top process and we are continuously planning.  The FX question for a long time it was a modest negative. It slipped to a modest positive in particular because of what’s happened with the euro and the pound and it strengthened against the US dollar. So we have seen a little bit of an offset in emerging markets where the dollar has strengthened against some of the key emerging market currencies. But right now it’s, day to day or week to week it’s kind of swinging between the net positive and a net negative. So relatively minor impact at this stage and that’s really something we’re calling out as a major assumption or guidance. But clearly it’s something we continue to focus on for contingency planning. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. You may begin. 
Michael Rehaut: I also just wanted to hit on a couple of short questions if possible. First in terms of the guidance, focusing on the share outstanding and the amount of free cash flow conversion, obviously you announced the acquisition which would take a portion of that. But I was wondering around your thoughts on share repurchase, is that something that you do on and off, and with the strong free cash flow in 2018 absent, any additional acquisitions. Is that something that we should be thinking about as you get in to the year end? And then just secondly on Craftsman, when should we expect sort of a shift towards insourcing some of the production that could cause a lift to the margins in that sales bucket. 
Jim Loree: Sure. It’s Jim, I’ll take the first question and I’ll ask Don to tackle the second one, and you may get a little color from Jeff about that. So on repurchase; let’s just jump a kind of a little more in altitude to capital allocation in general. And over the courses, as long as Don Allan, Jeff Ansell and I have been part of this company, we’ve had a capital allocation strategy, and giving 50% of our excess capital back to shareholders and then taking the other 50% and reinvesting it. And when you look at the dividend today is running a little over $300 million. Again we’re throwing off 1 billion and that’s a growing number now.  So there’s definitely, when you look at that long term framework, there’s definitely room for repurchase and we historically have repurchased and we’ve done at times when we thought the stock was severely undervalued in general and occasionally we’ve also from time to time used it to manage the share count to kind of a neutral as employee benefit types of dilution occurred or also when we have significant stock price increases and that might create some additional share count.  So we’ve done all of that, but I think right now, with the acquisitions that we’ve made and recently now another 440 million in the pipeline that is really, really strong in the acquisition area. In fact we’re executing integrations as effectively and quickly as we can in order to begin to create some organizational bandwidth for bringing some more acquisitions on.  So with all that going on, repurchases are fairly low on our list of capital allocation priorities. But that could change. We think of that over the long term and then we operate tactically in the short term based on a myriad of different observations and considerations. And so with that I’ll turn it over my colleagues here. 
Don Allan: I’ll start and just remind people of what we’ve said in that past about Craftsman and pulling that in to our supply chain and our manufacturing plants, and then I’ll let Jeff give a little more color around what we’re thinking over the next few years. But since what we’ve said, that really would be kind of a three year program of insourcing a large amount of these Craftsman products in to our, not all of them, but a large amount of them in to our manufacturing and supply chain, and it would be something a bit of a gradual impact over that three year time horizon. Jeff commented this morning that we still have a lot of work to do around capacity planning and we’re in the process of doing that. So we don’t have all the answer to it, but we do believe it will be a multi-year transition period. But Jeff why don’t you put out a little more color on that?
Jeff Ansell: So if you consider what we have to do in the core business, side by side with that we are doing concurrently in the fastening business, we’ll launch about a thousand new products at our core business every year and we’ll make about 85% of all those products that we sell around the world. So we are the most innovative tool company in the world and also we make the highest percentage of what we stock.  That won’t change and it can’t change because our core business have to continue to perform well. Concurrent with that we have to bring up several thousand Craftsman products. So imagine this, we launch a thousand products at our core, we have to launch 2000 Craftsman product around at the same time, and we’re capable of doing that.  At the same time, we want to repatriate Craftsman manufacturing as much as possible for United States. So we made an acquisition in 2017 of the pre-eminent metal tool manufacturing Waterloo that is a dedicated Craftsman manufacturing facility which is one of the things we committed to. So we will bring up that manufacturing of Craftsman products. We will make more than half of those products in year one, and we’ll make probably more than half of these products in United States year one.  But as Don said, it will take probably a 36 month period before we can get to the point where we are making the same percentage of the Craftsman product as we make in our core. But I think over a three year period we can certainly get there and we can repatriate much of that to the US to stand behind the Craftsman Brand.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. You may begin. 
Chris Belfiore: This is Chris for Steve. Just kind of back to the Craftsman topic, originally you guys have said that it was going to generate a $100 million of incremental sales every year. I’m just kind of curious, like with a lot that’s going on in this year’s brand, clothing stores, how do you guys think about that number now in terms of the expectations going forward?
Jim Loree: We still feel like the opportunity is very significant. It’s very difficult to gauge at this stage any change that we should make to that assumption. That assumption was based on what we believe are very reasonable factors. As we get deeper in to this tiny process that Jeff just described a few minutes ago, things will come to life when we indicate how quickly this ramp will go. But we are at a very early stage of this process and so at this point we are not looking to change anything around those assumptions. But as we get deeper and as those roll up, and when Amazon goes online at some point at this stage, we’ll probably provide an updated view on what we think the Craftsman brand will do. But it’s far too early. We’re sitting in January to really alter those assumptions. 
Operator: Our first question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. You may begin.
Tim Wojs: Nice job on Q4 and ’17. I guess just turning may be to the margins a little bit. I was worried if you could maybe give us a little bit of color on just the cadence within the tools business just given the price cost headwinds maybe in the first quarter and then how should we think about tools margins as you go through the year thanks. 
Don Allan: Sure. The first quarter clearly would be pressure because of that 50 million of kind of net to price commodity cost segment I mentioned. So for the tools business you will see a rate decline year-over-year in the first quarter because of that. And we also had an outstanding first quarter last year from a rate perspective for tools, and so you have a difficult comp and then you have this dynamic I just described. So it will be down a little bit year-over-year because of that.  But as the year progresses, you’ll see that get better and better and probably modestly down in the second quarter, and the it will start to show improvement year-over-year in the third and the fourth quarter. And it’s really because of that dynamic of commodity, inflation, hitting us pretty hard in the first half without the price recovery not coming until the later stages of the second quarter and back half of the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Redner with Bellman & Associates. You may begin. 
Scott Redner: My question was on the mid-teens POS noted at your large retailers in Tools & Storage, so for everyone to answer that. It seems like that that’s been a little slower than the prior quarters. So just curious if you guys could provide some context there, whether there was significant comp last year or kind of how you guys are thinking about that relative to the optimistic commentary. 
Don Allan: What I said was mid-single digit POS, not mid-teens, although we would love mid-teens, but it was mid-single digits. And I look at POS, you can’t really go crazy analyzing it quarter-by-quarter, you have to look at it over a multi-quarter period of time. And if you look at the North American business because I was commenting about POS and North America for certain customers, it was a little bit lower than the performance in North America, a couple of points. However, when you look at it over the entire year, it’s very much in line with the performance of our revenue performance for North America versus the POS for the year.  So that’s the best way to look at. The other thing to remember is that we had really strong performance outside of some of our retailers in North America in the fourth quarter, low double digit performance in the commercial channel. So you have to keep that in mind as well, that’s really pushing that number up in a positive way.  So truly those two factors, and again like we mentioned before, quarter-to-quarter POS is an important statistic to look at, but its more about the trend that you’re seeing and what you’re experiencing over multi quarters. And Jeff is going to answer on that. 
Jeff Ansell: In addition I would say we look at this, as Don said over a four quarter and time a rolling four quarter basis. And when looked at that way you can see clearly we’ve outgrown the market 2x. And the other feedback that we’ve received is from the customers the largest of our top 10 customers; we received Vendor of the Year Award because our POS would outpace their overall growth in the category. So what that would tell me is that POS is greater than the market, it’s greater than our largest customers, and weeks of supply are in line with prior year. So that says the things that we’re putting are going through the other end of the process in POS and we feel very good about global POS in total as much as we can gather. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. You may begin. 
Josh Pokrzywinski: On the Craftsman commentary and Don not really deviating off that $100 million of incremental revenue a year. I guess as I look at your organic growth guidance and the EPS associated with that it seems like incremental margins knowing that raw material are different line items are a little light versus where you’d be historically. If I assume that 100 million comes in at virtually no profitability, it still seems like it’s at league average or not. Is there an indication that as Craftsman ramps up this year that the launch cost chips away that profitability in a more material way or I guess just kind of help us bridge how that base incremental margin looks a little lighter than usual. 
Don Allan: I think the best way to think about it is that, the leverage that we put in our guidance has a couple of factors in it. Clearly one is, when you’re describing there’s a little bit of launch cost and the cost associated with Craftsman that has to be factored in in to that at lower profitability, and they certainly will be nice component of our organic growth in 2018.  The other thing to consider is that we have been on a steady program of investing for future growth in general as a company. And so as we get growth organically, we look at what investments we want to make in certain areas to continue to drive this growth over the mid-term and long term. And so therefore the leverage numbers you see are a little bit lower because of that as well. So it’s really those two factors that are driving that dynamic that you’re describing. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Wood with Nomura Instinet. You may begin. 
Unidentified Analyst: This is Mason on for Mike. Can you give us an update on FlexVolt sales, how many FlexVolt skews have now been rolled out and what are the initial number of FlexVolt product expected in 2018?
Jim Loree: As I indicated in my presentation, I’ll kick this over to Jeff for additional commentary. We were in line with our expectation for FlexVolt. FlexVolt will be a contributor to our guidance next year in our organic growth at 5% in the company, and it continues to be a very positive performer for us. I’ll as Jeff to give a little more color on that. 
Jeff Ansell: Yes, we couldn’t be happier with FlexVolt performance. If you look at the adoption rate, it’s still running at about 10x in terms of speed of adoption versus key technologies like brushless, which are fantastic. So that’s a great endorsement of what it does for the user. At this point we average about 4.9 stars on ratings around the world and that’s 18 months or 15 months in to the process. That’s the highest ratings we’ve ever achieved. So tremendous reviews, and what we’ve seen occur is as I kind of intimated in my remarks that we’ve seen our coated product that we make where we sell, which is a differentiator for us. We’ve seen that up mid-single digits, as the category was down about mid-single digits.  Our 20 volt range has grown faster than any time in history. At the same time, FlexVolt itself has grown dramatically. So if you add those three things together it says that there is a cannibalization to us there may be in the market, but its someone else’s cannibalization.  We launched key new products in the fourth quarter and the second half of last year. Things like cordless FlexVolt compressor that is revolutionary, its doing incredibly well, our new FlexVolt worm drive style saw that is absolutely converting corded products for the first time in history to cordless, with more follow in 2018.  The point I would make there though is, as we continue to launch FlexVolt, we will launch more and more industrial products as we can get more and more output and capacitites from these products. But if you consider the fact that in the last year putting our FlexVolt batteries in to market to drive cross country a 150 times if it were an electric car, we are incredibly proud of what FlexVolt has done for us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. You may begin. 
Rob Wertheimer: Question is on 4Q margin Tools & Storage, and obviously you guys have got a lot going on under the (inaudible). Sequentially maybe it was a little bit lighter that we might have thought and you got commodity, and I wanted to ask if commodity was the driver of that. If there’s any excess freights, any production tangles or just inefficiencies some extreme growth here seen or whether it’s just an investment?
Jim Loree: We were very pleased with the margin performance of Tools, as I mentioned 50 basis points improvement year-over-year, an incredibly strong organic growth. However, there’s a little bit of pressure on the margins for some of those things you mentioned. Commodity inflation continues to be something that we experienced in the fourth quarter that rolled on to this year with really no price recovery in the fourth quarter. And then I would say that was modest rate increases associated with the high levels of organic growth, but nothing that really dramatically moved the needle in the business. But I think the major factor was more in the commodity (inaudible).
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Market. You may begin. 
Ken Zener: The cannibalization, I think that’s the most incremental piece of information you’ve communicated today beyond your execution, might I say that. Well FlexVolt, if you’re growing to walk it almost means you are extending your brand awareness and your product is other people envelop your portfolio tools not someone else’s. Why do you think and Jeff you gave us these numbers. But why do you think that’s happening, why didn’t you anticipate it, and most importantly what are the implications as you continue to kind of drive core battery in to what have been corded and/or what will be (inaudible) eventually. 
Jim Loree: The FlexVolt program has been a tremendous brand development and brand halo that had an effect on what was already an amazingly strong brand in the professional but guaranteed tough kind of segment, and plus it just takes it to another level. So that’s one thing. I think the second thing is, and I’ve said this before the installed base that we’re developing of batteries that work on 60 volt to FlexVolt tools and 20 volt tools.  The FlexVolt battery obviously works on – is backwards compatible for the 20 volt. So when you start to develop this installed base of batteries and all of a sudden you have the functionality, the user has the functionality to be able to run the tool effectively three times longer of a 20 volt tool that is a real kind of value driver and value proposition advantage for FlexVolt.  So I think that was sort of one of the things that we wondered how effective that impact would be. And I think what we’re finding out is it’s probably very, very significant. That’s my (inaudible) and then I’ll turn it over to Jeff and see if you have anything more you want to add to that. 
Jeff Ansell: If you back in time to when Stanley Black & Decker’s came together, you would look at the volt which was a fantastic brand franchise that probably believe was in a period of decline given the technology change where it offered (inaudible) and the world had moved to lithium.  Fast forward to where we are today and a couple of stats for you. We now make the volt in the United States which the competitors cannot do in power tools. We expanded that the volt brand promise to tremendous hand tools to storage products, lasers, all great products. We introduced our lithium ion answer in 2011 and ’12 and a stat that you wouldn’t be aware of; we’re now three times bigger than lithium that we ever were at our peak in [non-caths]. So that is an awesome statement.  We’ve introduced brushless at the same time. Brushless is now bigger than [non-cath] ever was. And on top of that we’ve improved our reliability, highest reliability in the industry, greatest number of innovations and excellence going on top of that, and you’re seeing what happens. The user who always loved the volt now has so many more reasons to love, embrace and endorse it, and we’re seeing the level commitment to the volt has never been higher and we’re pleased with that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. You may begin. 
David MacGregor: If I could just pick up for a clarification on Ken’s question, I wanted to ask another question on FlexVolt. But regarding the cannibalization are we at a point where you can assume that the FlexVolt growing forward is largely incremental or is there a reason to believe that cannibalizations could be a future threat and emerge in some of the future points. And my question more on the margins was, the FlexVolt is running below tool segment average, is that due to launch cost and heavier promotional expense etcetera. And once we get beyond the large percentage margins on FlexVolt or expected to exceed the segment average or is this line expected to be at or below segment average margins for the foreseeable future. 
Jim Loree: I’ll give the margins question to Don, but the way I’m thinking about FlexVolt at this point, it’s going to be a steady contributor to our organic growth as time goes on, and at this point it’s hard to really understand FlexVolt, versus 20 volt, versus (inaudible) and what are all the dynamics other than we know what’s already been said which is, it’s a positive mix of effects and in that regard I think it’s going to continue to be a real catalyst for above market organic growth for Stanley Black & Decker’s and for (inaudible).
Don Allan: On the margin question on FlexVolt, I would say that we did have that period of time where we were below line average. It probably extended a little longer than originally projected because some of the investments we were making in our marketing in particular to really make sure that people understood the technology and how tactful it is and clearly some of the comments you’re hearing from Jim and Jeff would indicate that added the chase.  So as we go in to 2018, we would expect it to be right around line average margins and it’s not something that would be negative to the margin or a dramatic positive at this stage. 
Operator: This concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. 
Dennis Lange: Shannon thanks. We’d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2017 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third quarter 2017 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to on the call, are available on the IR section of the website. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don, and Jeff will review our third quarter 2017 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's release, we delivered a strong third quarter continuing our track record of a solid execution. In fact this is the 16th consecutive quarter where we have met or exceeded expectations. Tools & Storage and Industrial led the way, once again contributing a robust organic growth performance which was 7% for the quarter. Total company revenue growth came in at 14%. Acquisitions delivered nine points of growth which includes the offset from the impact of the mechanical security divestiture. Tools & Storage delivered 22% total growth, including 9% organic. All regions contributed to the continued growth and share gains of this franchise. And of note was the acceleration within emerging markets which produced 16% organic growth in the quarter and mid-teens growth in all three regions Latin America, Asia, and the rest of the emerging world. The tools folks are executing superbly by leveraging our SFS 2.0 operating system to deliver core and breakthrough innovation with operating margin expansion, at the same time integrating the Lenox, Irwin, and Craftsman brands into our portfolio. This was an outstanding effort by Jeff Ansell and the entire Tools & Storage team. Jeff, as mentioned, he is with us today on the call and will be providing some more color. And looking forward, we expect to benefit from a series of growth catalyst in Tools, including DC brushless, FlexVolt, the Newell Tools acquisition, and beginning in mid-2018 the Craftsman brand. The Industrial segment delivered a significant outperformance for the quarter continuing its 2017 trend of strong results. Organic growth at 8% was impressive. And in Engineered Fastening, we continued to see robust automotive system sales in addition to higher industrial volumes which supported 6% organic growth for the quarter. Our infrastructure businesses delivered 15% organic growth, an outstanding performance as commercial actions, plus positive underlying markets benefited both project and inspection activity within oil and gas and expanded hydraulic tools volumes. Our total company operating margin rate remained healthy at 15.3%. Excluding M&A related charges, a 10 basis point expansion versus the third quarter of 2016, we continue to focus on investing in future growth, while generating meaningful operating leverage. In this thing, productivity execution and other cost actions enabled us to offset increasing commodity inflation, while expanding our gross margin rate by 60 basis points. The strong innovation fueled growth positioned us to continue to make a series of targeted investments to support future innovation, growth, and margin expansion. Diluted adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.95, 16% above prior year reflecting strong operational execution. So I want to thank our teams around the globe for their dedication and results driven work that produced this great quarter and year-to-date performance. And based on the above market organic growth and our confidence in the outlook for the balance of the year, we're once again rising the mid-point of our previous 2017 full-year adjusted EPS guidance this time by $0.10 with a new range of $7.33 to $7.43 or between 13% to 14% growth. And now I'll turn to an update on the acquisition of Lenox and Irwin businesses, as well as the Craftsman Brand. In a nutshell, we remain at or ahead of our expectations both from a financial and integration execution perspective. Specific to Newell Tools, we continue to execute on our plans to integrate employee, suppliers, and customers, into our existing operations. We remain focused on and confident in our ability to capture the $80 million to $90 million of cost synergies associated with this transaction. We're deploying core SFS principles into production facilities and are in the late stages of moving order fulfillment into our own distribution centers. We're happy to report that our actions to improve customer service levels across the Lenox and Irwin product lines have been successful and we are now experiencing fill rates commensurate with the strong performance of our legacy brands across the portfolio. In addition our commercial teams around the world are building detailed plans to support future revenue synergies. And we remain optimistic that a meaningful contribution in that area is achievable in 2018 and beyond. Now turning to Craftsman. We are hard at work bringing our vision for this great brand to life. We continue to make progress on Craftsman product development, supply chain deployment, and commercial strategy. We have now extracted all of our Craftsman supplier management activities from Sears and are fulfilling orders through a new distribution center in Charlotte. Importantly, in the last few weeks, we reached agreement with a major U.S. retailer on a program which features a 2018 rollout for the new brand. Jeff will provide more color on this in a few minutes. We are excited about the opportunity ahead as we re-Americanize this iconic brand and are looking forward to it coming to life beginning in mid-2018. So as you can tell there is a growing momentum and continued enthusiasm for both of these transactions as catalysts and we continue to find ways to deliver significant and sustained value to our customers and in turn our shareholders. And I'll now turn it over to Don for a more detailed review of the third quarter results.
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. I'll now take a deeper dive into the results of our business segments which enabled the company to deliver another outstanding performance in the third quarter. Starting with Tools & Storage, revenues were up 22% in the quarter as 9% organic growth, 13 points of acquisitive growth, and one point of currency combined to more than offset one point impact from divestitures. Pricing was slightly positive for the quarter. The operating margin for this segment was robust at 17.8% as benefits of volume leverage and productivity more than offset growth investments and commodity inflation, yielding a 40 basis point rate expansion versus the prior year. Importantly, the organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU. On a geographic basis, North America was up 9% organically with strong performances across all channels, U.S. commercial and retail channels posted high-single-digit growth, while our industrial and auto repair markets generated mid-single-digit growth. Additionally Canada contributes solid organic growth of 10%. North America's growth continued to be fueled by new product introductions across the portfolio and strong commercial execution. POS was up low-double-digits while inventory within our major customers was in line to slightly below prior year levels, giving us confidence that the strong selling was supported by strong underlying demand. Europe delivered another solid performance with 5% organic growth. Nine out of the 10 markets grew organically with double-digit performances in Iberia and Central Europe and solid mid-single-digit performances in the UK and France. The team continues to leverage our portfolio of brands and expand our retail relationships to produce sustained above market organic growth. Finally, as Jim mentioned, the emerging markets delivered an outstanding 16% organic growth. With mid-teen growth across all regions, diligent pricing actions as well as the ongoing MPP launch across the developing markets continued to support growth. We continue to see the e-commerce channel increase its share of the market and become a larger contributor to the business. Latin America was very strong headlined by double-digit growth in Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, and Peru, while Mexico and Chile delivered high-single-digit results. In emerging markets outside of Latin America, we experienced strong performances as well. For instance, our change to a direct selling model within Turkey and Russia are now paying dividends as both delivered exceptional growth within the quarter. Also India and China posted double-digit growth in Q3. This emerging market performance is quite impressive considering the team overcame challenges relating to natural disasters and geopolitical events yet still delivered broad-based share gains in the quarter. Within the Tools & Storage SBUs, all lines demonstrated positive growth in the quarter. The power tool and equipment growth was up 10%, led by professional power tools as well as continued strength on the outdoor segment. This SBU also benefitted from new product introductions reflecting core innovation and FlexVolt and combined with strong commercial execution. Regarding FlexVolt, this breakthrough innovation continues to deliver growth aligned with our expectations. Based on year-to-date sales and new product launches, we remain confident in our ability to deliver revenues approaching $300 million in 2017, as we discussed last quarter. We believe the impact of cannibalization on our corded products has been minimal and the program has carried positive benefits across the DᴇWALT brand. This is evidenced by above market growth on our corded products as well as our base 20 volt system. This bodes well for the Tools team's ability to deliver ongoing share gains. Our Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage organization generated 7% growth on new product introductions while benefiting from strong performances within the construction and industrial end markets. This team continues to deliver a stream of core innovation, while leading the integration activity for our Lenox, Irwin, and Craftsman brands. So in summary, an outstanding quarter for the Tools & Storage organization continuing its momentum by delivering solid above market organic growth along with operating margin expansion of 40 basis points, an outstanding quarter. Turning to the Industrial segment which had another impressive quarter of outperformance as well as both the Engineered Fastening and infrastructure businesses delivered strong organic growth well in excess of our expectations. This top-line performance contributed to 120 basis points expansion and operating margin rate which was driven from volume leverage, productivity, and cost control. Engineered Fastening posted 6% organic growth during the quarter fueled by strong automotive and industrial results up low-double-digits and mid-single-digits respectively. Within automotive, growth was led by higher than expected system shipments to support new model launches primarily in Europe and Asia. Spare system orders were also stronger than expected driving the overall automotive outperformance. In auto fastener, sales delivered content gains and outpaced light vehicle production by approximately 500 basis points which was better than our long-term assumption of approximately 300 basis points to 400 basis points of growth ahead of this type of production. Finally, industrial fastener growth reflected positive market conditions and enhanced commercial actions with our industrial focused customers. Moving to the infrastructure businesses, they posted a solid quarter up 15% organically. Hydraulic tools grew 37% as they continue to see the benefits from the execution of a successful commercial action as well as an improved market environment. This performance reflects commercial excellence and in action as all regions contributed to the businesses fourth consecutive and highest quarter of organic growth. Meanwhile oil and gas generated 8% organic growth in the quarter driven by onshore pipeline project extensions in North America and increased global inspection activities. The inspection business continues to outperform as the team's commercial efforts have grown this business over 60% organically year-to-date. All of these activities more than offset a continued and expected decline in the offshore project activity. Finally, the Security segment delivered flat organic growth for the third quarter as gains in Europe were offset by a decline in North America. Europe organic growth was up 1%, as strength in the Nordics and UK were offset by anticipated ongoing weakness in France. North America organic growth was down 1% as strong healthcare related growth was more than offset by the impact of customer directed project delays and hurricane disruptions within the commercial electronic security business. The impact of these external headwinds approximated three points of organic growth for the North American business. Our expectation is that these are timing issues which will resolve themselves over the coming quarters. In terms of the profitability the segment declined 240 basis points year-over-year. The sale of the mechanical lock business drove approximately 100 basis points of this contraction. The remaining 140 basis points decline was attributable to the previously mentioned customer driven project delays and modest levels of investment to support long-term growth. The Security team remains focused on innovation along with commercial and operational effectiveness to position the business for future revenue growth and margin expansion. Let's take a look at the quarter's free cash flow performance on the next page. For the third quarter free cash flow was $266 million which brings our year-to-date performance to $190 million. The lower year-to-date results compared to the prior year relate primarily to higher levels of working capital required to service the stronger organic growth we are experiencing particularly within the Tools & Storage business. From a working capital term perspective we delivered 6.4 turns in the third quarter, a decrease of 0.7 turns versus the prior year. This decline reflects the impact of our recent portfolio activity, specifically the acquisition of the Lenox, Irwin, and Craftsman Brands. Excluding acquisition and divestures turns were flat versus the prior year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong cash flow in the fourth quarter given our core SFS principles and focused execution on reducing working capital levels in line with Q4 seasonal activity. For those that have followed our business for the past several years, you know that the fourth quarter Tools & Storage seasonality dynamic is a regular occurrence, given the timing of the sales and the collections that occur within the quarter. We expect by the end of 2017 that we will deliver a 2.5 working capital turn improvement up from the 6.4 turns reported this quarter. This working capital result will generate $575 million of cash flow benefit in Q4 which will enable us to approximate and approach 100% free cash flow conversion. As a note this conversion rate excludes a net gain from divestitures. So now let's turn to our 2017 guidance on the next slide. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are raising the 2017 adjusted EPS midpoint by $0.10 and tightening the outlook range. Therefore our revised guidance range is $7.33 to $7.43, which is an increase of 13% to 14% versus prior year. On a GAAP basis this results an $8.20, $8.30 earnings per share which is inclusive of various one-time charges and the gains and losses on the sales of business. The increase to our outlook range is primarily the result of higher organic growth, now approaching 6% for the full-year, offset partially by increased other net expenses, primarily related to foreign exchange losses and certain balance sheet positions caused by the recent volatility in currency markets. Turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page organic growth within Tools & Storage is now expected to be high-single-digits given the solid year-to-date performance and outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect healthy construction markets in the U.S. combined with continued stable European and emerging market environments to continue for the balance of the year. We believe the top-line growth will translate into an improved margin rates year-over-year as well. We're maintaining the organic growth view on Security of low-single-digits in 2017. The margin rates of this segment will be down year-over-year due to the divestiture of the mechanical locks business which occurred during the first quarter, along with the impacts of mix both geographic and customer mix as well as the growth investments. Finally in the Industrial segment we expect organic growth to be up mid-single-digits, modestly higher than our previous expectation. While we did see outperformance in both engineered fastening and infrastructure again in Q3 there are market related pressures which will impact the fourth quarter. These pressures fall into three primary categories. The first declining North America light vehicle production, second, less automotive system sales due to lower new model introductions, and three, expectations for lower North American oil and gas project activity in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect operating margins within the Industrial segment to improve for the entire year which will affect the solid year-to-date performance. So in summary we believe we have a solid path to deliver the full-year revised guidance which contemplates continued above market organic growth and margin expansion while our businesses remain focused on working capital turn improvement in Q4 and acquisition integration. We also believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company for earnings growth, margin expansion, and strong cash flow in 2018 consistent with our long-term financial objectives. With that I would like to turn the call over to Jeff for a brief update on Tools & Storage and some exciting news related to Craftsman.
Jeff Ansell: Thank you, Don. 2017 is shaping up to be a strong year for global Tools & Storage. We delivered organic growth at every region, every strategic business unit, and with all of our top customers. In fact, we've received vendor awards for more than 10 of our largest customers this year. Our brands continued to perform well on a global basis. With brands like Black & Decker, Stanley, Porter-Cable, and Mac Tools, all up single-digits while brands like Proto, Vidmar, and DᴇWALT all grew double-digits. Innovation is a clear differentiator using DᴇWALT as an example; we've posted 3% growth this year in the declining corded power tool market simply based upon our Made in USA strategy. Add to this, over 20% year-to-date growth in our world's largest and best 20 volt cordless range, which continues to expand with our cord innovation focus. Finally add over 100% growth in our technologically superior flexible range. All in all it's a formidable share gain machine from top to bottom as demonstrated by at least two times market POS growth. All of this has occurred concurrent with the integration of the second and fourth largest acquisitions in our company's history namely Irwin, Lenox, and Craftsman brands. With this as a backdrop, I'm pleased to provide an update on an initiative that will be a catalyst for further organic growth to Craftsman brand. Over the past six months, we built a completely dedicated team to bring our vision of a new re-Americanized Craftsman delight. This team is responsible for the development of a best ever craftsman product pipeline to reinvigorate the iconic Craftsman brand. As Jim mentioned earlier, we continue to make great progress on Craftsman product development, supply chain deployment, and commercial strategy which includes the full support of Ace Hardware through their 2,800 stores supporting Craftsman. Today, we're also pleased to announce that we will roll out the Craftsman brand in the second half of 2018 with Lowe's in the home center channel. We have been more than impressed with the level of commitment and support afforded by Lowe's for the Craftsman brand. We continue working with other channel partners to continue to provide them with successful programs to facilitate their growth as well. With this said, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim to wrap up today's presentation.
Jim Loree: Thank you, Jeff. Another extraordinarily strong quarter for Tools & Storage and an exciting development in connection with Craftsman brand. To recap for the total company, we delivered strong third quarter results maintaining our trend of above market organic growth and robust operating margin performance. Facilitated by our continued strong operating results, we increased EPS guidance for the year excluding charges and the gain on the sale of mechanical security we up guidance to $7.38 at the midpoint, a 13% increase over the prior year, and we continue to be excited about the opportunities to deliver value from our recent acquisitions. And as I mentioned earlier, both the Newell tools and Craftsman brand integrations remain on track and the experienced integration teams are energized to deliver our financial and customer commitments. Our deep and agile leadership team along with our entire employee base are focused on closing out 2017 with a good set up for 2018 leveraging our SFS 2.0 operating system to deliver strong free cash flow, organic growth with earnings leverage and continuing to successfully integrate the Lenox, Irwin, and Craftsman brands into our portfolio. We're encouraged by our results thus far in 2017 as we continue to position the company for a strong 2018. A little over one year into the role as CEO I could not be more pleased with the energy and enthusiasm from the team as we remain focused on delivering top quartile performance becoming known as one of the world's great innovators and demonstrating our commitment to social responsibility. These are all enablers to achieve our 22/22 vision and to be a great human centered diversified industrial company. And on a final note, I would like to thank Greg Waybright for his many years of dedicated service as our VP of IR. He is retiring at the end of this month to be succeeded by the very capable Dennis Lange. All the best Greg in your retirement and we're now ready for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you.
Dennis Lange: We can now open the call for Q&A please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. You may begin.
Jeff Sprague: Good morning. Just looking for a little bit more detail on Craftsman if you could share it, if you have any preliminary thoughts on what channel fill or year one revenue could look like? And also I think you were planning on marrying this with the Craftsman specific e-commerce strategy and I wonder if you flush that out anymore yet? Thank you.
Jim Loree: So the advantage of being able to talk about Craftsman at the level we did is that it enables our partner loves to be able to report what could be a material item to their -- in connection with their releases and so forth. It really we would have preferred actually not to have to disclose as much as we actually did right now just from the standpoint of competitive intelligence, protection of our competitive strategy, and so forth. So it makes it very difficult to go into too much more detail. But with that I will turn it over to Jeff and he will give you whatever else he can.
Jeff Ansell: Thanks, Jim. I guess the view would be Craftsman is a broad-based brand across North America, plays across so many categories and channels. And given that we serve every geography well over 50,000 discrete customers, we're very proud to announce this partnership with Lowe's in the home center channel. We are concurrently working through the commercial process across other channels which includes e-commerce. We do well know that Craftsman is the number one search term in e-commerce -- in e-commerce space; it also is a great brand across MRO spaces et cetera. So a lot of good work to be done as Jim reported, we announced everything we could to this point but Craftsman continues to be a good opportunity across many different customers and channels.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
Nigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. Greg congratulations. I just want to say Greg has been -- was one of the best IRs and big loss but Dennis is awesome, so I think you're good. So just want to clarify your FlexVolt conversation, you had previously said $3 million of growth, $2 million in that. Are we now closer to $300 million net for the year? So if you can just clarify that. My question is really on just a follow-up on Jeff's point on Craftsman; I think your original kind of plan was for 2020 sales of $300 million to $400 million for Craftsman. Given the conversations you've had with your e-commerce and big-box partner, where do we stand there now? I'm assuming it's higher than that but any sense there would be helpful?
Jim Loree: I'll start the FlexVolt and then kick over the Craftsman question to Jeff. But FlexVolt as I indicated we're approaching $300 million for the full-year of 2017. We do not believe we are seeing very much cannibalization I said minimal, probably minimal close to zero and therefore from that perspective, the net number would be $300 million. Jeff?
Jeff Ansell: In regard to Craftsman second question was I guess at this point there is still much work yet to be done. We build a dedicated team of well over 100 folks to do the really good work of building out as we call it a re-Americanized best ever Craftsman platform and what that means is we're starting with a parcel of land overlooking the ocean with no structure on it as an example. So much work to be done. But the great news is you take a 90-year emotionally charged brand like Craftsman, and you can build it from the ground up very rare that you have that opportunity. So there is so much to be done with thousands of products in development that I think that 2018 looks like really a labor of love to us at this point with much great work to be done. But we remain on track probably for the second half of next year and we feel really confident about the guidance we previously presented around Craftsman growth.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. You may begin.
Ken Zener: We've recently done a piece on the tool industry noting the consolidation of brands over the last 30-plus-years and obviously think you are well positioned within that environment. Given the success that Black & Decker merger ultimately provided you're high margins to hand drills indicate that's still an upward trajectory this year and now Craftsman and I walk into Ace Hardware it's pretty much just you all. And with Lenox and Irwin I mean you’re now into that accessories business which is very well, it's been very okay now it's consolidating. What do you think your appetite for bringing in perhaps another power brand into your portfolio as you look to move into gas; I think that's probably that Jeff touched on at the Investor Day. You have the brands to get into gas today.
Jim Loree: Yes. So let me just sort of circle back and talk about what our strategy is from an M&A perspective and I think that will help put things in context. So the first element of our strategy is protect the core. And I think you've seen as assets have become available, quality assets in the tool business which is part of our -- significant really most significant part of our core, we had been agile and made some moves that have been designed to not only protect but also enhance the core. And I think one of the things that's hard for people to understand and I think maybe you got a little bit of it from listening to Jeff is the absolute amount of effort that goes into integrating something like even like a Lenox or a Irwin but when you talk about Craftsman starting from literally nothing more than a brand, a history, and three people which is what we got with that that is an enormous undertaking and we're so pleased with the progress that we’re making along the way here to do the design work and the supply chain work and the commercialization and so forth. But it is very consuming for the organization and I have never seen including at the time that we integrated Black & Decker and Stanley, I have never seen the organization work so hard, so diligently, and produced so much and so right now it is almost impossible to imagine we get further on down the pike, probably another year, year-and-a-half something like that, when the organization has more bandwidth to think about doing something else in Tools whether the Lawn & Garden which has now become essentially part of the core as a result of the Craftsman acquisition or whether it be some other assets that might be out there available in the future. And then so the second part of our strategy is really to make sure that we continue our progress to invest in some other areas outside of Tools in -- that are also parts of our core, important parts of our core. So things areas such as Industrial and in Security and we fully intend to be feeding those segments or those businesses, franchises with capital and allocate the acquisition capital into those segments where it makes sense. And so one of the nice advantages of being a diversified industrial company is that enables us to direct capital in different parts of the portfolio based on availability of assets but also bandwidth of the organization and financial capacity of the company to absorb. So hope that's helpful but I think it basically says that it will be a while before we endeavor into something like Lawn & Garden or some other tool areas.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin.
Rich Kwas: And Dennis, look forward to continue to work with you. Just on Craftsman as we think about the next couple of years with limited detail around revenue contribution et cetera and no detail around revenue contribution but as we think big picture incremental for Tools & Storage, should we think about dampening effect at least in the initial years of the launch because of cost and integration, et cetera, and getting up to speed from a marketing standpoint? And just broad, Don or Jim, around how we should amount [ph] of incrementals over the next 12 to 18 months within the segment?
Don Allan: Sure, I will take that Rich. It's a very good question and a good point. The -- as Jeff and Jim both articulated very well, we're probably excited about this relationship and it's one of many steps as we continue to build out the plan for Craftsman. But as we enter into the execution of Craftsman, it will clearly be margins that will be below line average initially for various different reasons, we will not be manufacturing a lot of the product initially, we will be using sourcing model in the first year or two, then we will begin the ramp up manufacturing in that same timeframe. That will help margin and continue to improve them, we will also have launch cost like to do with all major initiatives that will pressure margins as well. So we don't think it will be major dampening impact in the Tools margin but it certainly will have a modest negative impact in 2018, and likely in at least the first half of 2019 if not the full-year of 2019. Difficult to quantify the impact at this stage as we're still working through as Jeff mentioned -- exactly how the launch and the timing and what products will go in with Lowe's and with other customers still to be determined. But over time we will provide more clarity as we get deeper into providing guidance for 2018 and then further into 2018 throughout the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. You may begin.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Just on the Lowe's launch, trying to dig in here on may be some of the opportunity set in ring-fencing that $300 million to $400 million target you have a couple of years out. Given that I think DIY U.S. for you guys and individual big box retailer would be something north of a billion, one would think that just given some of the limited overlap particularly on Lawn & Garden that you could have a pretty big number initially, just with channel sale, I mean is that an unfair way to think about it or is that the price point so much lower in Lawn & Garden versus Power Tools that it shifts the curve I guess I'm surprised that that number might not be bias to the upside, just given the magnitude of even one big DIY launch?
Jim Loree: I think Jeff said it all, it's early days here and the amount of specifics even as it relates to the Lowe's conversations, our TBD in terms of a lot of work still to be done, so it's hard to really come out and answer that question with anything specific other than say that when we put the $1 billion over 10 years out there on the -- when we announced the acquisition and when our board approved the acquisition on that basis, we really didn't really fully know how the customer conversations would evolve. So I think it's fair to say that we thought we were being conservative when we put those numbers on the table. But as it relates to the timeframe, the profitability, the ramp, all these types of things, it's just too early but we will keep you posted as we get more clarity as time goes on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital. You may begin.
Saliq Khan: Hi, Jim, kind of getting away from Craftsman looking at the Security business, could you provide us a bit more detail on what the free cash flow profile looks like and what are some of the efforts and progress that you have in place to help you drive this in new markets and new customer segments, so you can better leverage the channel partnerships particularly as you look into the next year?
Jim Loree: Well it's always; Security is always a great cash flow business for us because we're in the commercial security business and in commercial security the customer pays for the installation as opposed to residential security where historically the vendor, if you will, has paid for the CapEx upfront. So cash flow is a great stream and the recurring revenue is a dependable stream as well. So the existing business we will call it the core commercial security business, it's a good business but what's happening in the digital world and I think as everybody knows is the advent of Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, I could go on we all are familiar with the laundry list of new technologies that are facilitating great value creation for customers be that commercial or otherwise, but in this case I think the fact that they would be commercial is relevant. And I think we have a really, really great asset that we can leverage to become an integrator for those types of technologies in specific applications, specific areas, and not only that but to also develop recurring revenue streams that are differentiated -- the value proposition are differentiated and recurring revenue streams will continue. So I think we will end up with a core commercial security business that we have today that will be enhanced through innovation and sustainable for a long period of time. And on top of that, I think we will start to see the emergence of a growth oriented higher technological content business that is scalable and will develop an ecosystem. That will take some time but we are doing everything on our power to accelerate that and to make sure that as the market unfolds that we have a position deployed in that market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Belfiore with UBS. You may begin.
Chris Belfiore: Good morning guys. Greg, thanks for all your help, it's been a pleasure. And I look forward to working with Dennis again. So just kind of wanted you to kind of go talk a little bit on pricing especially in Tools and business -- in Tools & Storage business just lot of the other headwinds you're seeing out there some of the distributors that we cover but it's been relatively flat year-to-date you had commodity headwinds continues, so just kind of a little color on the pricing environment and then maybe kind of how we can expect that to the price cost equation to kind of see as we kind of move into next year?
Don Allan: Sure. I will start and then we will pass it over to Jeff to provide a little more color but we had a third quarter that was slightly positive for price in Tools & Storage. Within that if you kind of break it apart; you have a North American business that had kind of a normal promotional activities that occur in the quarter. So there was some negative price, a lot of close to a point in North America. And then outside of North America we had positive pricing actions that offset that due to various different things such as commodity inflation, currency movements et cetera. And so the net result was a slight positive. So that's just to give you a little more detail. As we go into next year, we actually see a fair amount of commodity inflation coming into the mix. As I've mentioned before we had about $100 million, it looks like, next year. Now the number looks to be closer to $150 million of commodity inflation. And we're in the process now of looking at what additional pricing actions we can take in response to that. If you look at our history we probably get anywhere from 60% to 70% of price recovery in year one but we're looking at how we can be more aggressive and make that number much closer to 100%. But as you all know it's a process that takes quite a bit of time working with our customers. Jeff any additional color?
Jeff Ansell: Maybe the only thing to add would be bit on the process. So when it comes to an inflationary environment from a commodity perspective, as Don just described, our first action is to do everything possible inside of our network to drive productivity to attack those costs and the things that we can cover we certainly pass along in the way of price. So we work with our customers in that regard. We also get smarter as time goes on. So clearly the second and fourth quarter are the biggest promotional periods for any tool company, but probably 25% of all the programming that we do annually is eliminated in one year and change for the next. So we learned what worked, what didn't work, where we'll spend money, whether we had a good payback on that. And at least a quarter of what we do every year changes as we get smarter get more experience et cetera and we will continue to work those things so that we get the best possible payback for the investment of price that you mentioned.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. You may begin.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi good morning. A lot of things happening that seem to be going quite well at once. Jim could you maybe give an overview of how you think about the process and progress in the breakthrough innovation centers, would you consider the staging whatever the next innovation it might be just given all the opportunities you have at Craftsman maybe there is something at Craftsman I don't know just maybe give us an update on that where I know that is lot percolating behind the scenes?
Jim Loree: Yes. Well I'm actually quite thrilled with the innovation that's come out of our breakthrough innovation teams obviously FlexVolt was pilot and it really was major homerun. Some of the other innovations, a good portion of the other innovations are a little bit more on the periphery of our core. So an example would be the connected job site that we have put together. We have the world's best tech connected job site which brings Wi-Fi to construction projects and then it brings Internet of Things to projects and then construction sites and then brings intelligent analytics and interfaces with architectural design systems and even integrate things like augmented reality and so forth. Very exciting innovation they had worked really hard on it, it’s been piloted three times unsuccessfully on different major construction sites. And so now it's time to scale it. And that's where I would say our biggest challenge comes in and what we're needing to do with this to make sure that we scale it appropriately is to create a more exponential oriented organization. So in the traditional organization in this case just came out of the power tool business. So you have power tool commercial people who have a history of great success commercializing power tools and now we're trying to sell connected job sites. Well it's a different skillset, the customers are the same but it's a different skillset and so we need partners, we need different skillsets in our own organization and we also need to liberate them, so they can go spend more money to scale it faster to the extent that we can afford that in our very measured kind of investment management ways that enables us to both achieve operating leverage on one end at the same time, make investments. I know there were some people on the phone this morning before the call, some of the analysts were saying well why didn't you get more operating leverage in tools, while we spent more money on investments for the future in tools and that's one of the big reasons and so that's kind of the challenge is really gauging from a financial standpoint but getting them enough capital and expense to liberate them to go often and scale appropriately when they created a great thing like the connect job sites. And then just providing a little different organizational model which we will talk more and more about in the coming quarters but we're doing some work with breaking out some exponential organizations from the traditional organization and I think that's going to be one of the key elements of the success in commercializing the breakthrough innovations that are not let's say necessarily right in the middle of the fairway. The FlexVolt is a battery system, the power tool commercialization people know how to commercialize battery systems, and the digital marketing folks from the digital accelerator down at Atlanta were very helpful in enabling that digital marketing approach for that project and it was just a fabulous combination of leveraging our existing resources. And some of the other innovations and not all of them, probably two or three, four of them are really into core and you will see them coming out over time in the traditional organization, but I think some other ones probably see a little different approach more of a silicon valley like approach to commercializing.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. You may begin.
Robert Barry: Actually, just, first, had a quick follow-up on that prior question on price. I know last quarter you had talked about these pricing experiments switching price a little harder and then adjusting the volume impact. I'm just curious if that continued this quarter and then my question though was really on the core growth outlook, I mean last quarter you raised 50 bps that added $0.10 to EPS, I must say it was a little anti-climatic to see 150 basis points rise this quarter largely offset by this other net. Can you quantify and provide more color on what's going on there and then how did that line in the model track next year, would that be expected to step down materially in 2018? Thanks.
Jim Loree: Okay. I will answer the part related to your question about the experiments, the pricing experiments then I will turn it over to Don. So I have promised myself and actually I promised my team as well never to say the word experiment in connection with pricing again after the brouhaha it created after the last call. So pricing is an iterative process and I think Jeff kind of addressed it already that Jeff is there anything else you want to say about that before we turn it over to Don for the second part of the question.
Jeff Ansell: No, sir.
Jim Loree: Okay. Then Don?
Don Allan: Okay. So I will walk through a little of the detail. We had very good operating leverage in the quarter. So if there is a confusion on that we would be happy to walk through it after the call in more detail. But if you look at the revenue outperformance versus our operating margin outperformance we're pretty much in line with what we previously communicated if we have a point of revenue better than expected, what would drop through to O&M. So that conversion rate pretty -- which is pretty much in line with what we communicated which is anywhere between 25% and 35%. What happened in other net which is low operating margin is as I mentioned in my presentation was that we had some currency positions related to balance sheet items that sometimes as they get settled throughout the quarter based on currency movements you experience as gain or losses. In this case we had about $7 million to $10 million of losses in the third quarter from that activity. That put a little pressure on the additional EPS flow through but still $0.10 outperformance versus expectation versus may be $0.12 to $0.14 expectation, I still think that's an heck of an operating leverage performance. As far as what it means for next year, I continue to believe that we will grow in line with our long-term financial commitments and objectives, we have 4% to 6% organic growth, 10% to 12% EPS growth, and 100% free cash flow conversion. Those have been our long term financial objectives and I think next year at this stage even with $150 million of commodity inflation coming in to the mix next year with offsetting pricing actions of some magnitude I believe that we can hit those objectives.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. You may begin. David MacGregor, your line is open. Please check your mute button.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Redner with Bellman & Associates. You may begin.
Scott Redner: Wanting to go back to LatAm, our emerging market growth in Tools & Storage, I was hoping you guys give a little bit more color kind of what in terms of distribution change was it kind of a one-time bump versus what's it go-forward rate just realizing that that business saw such trend this quarter?
Jim Loree: Yes, it's more of an ongoing growth initiative than a one-time bump because the reason we made these changes is absolutely for the purpose of driving share gain and organic growth in Turkey and in Russia. So if you think about the approach that we used to have, we had a couple of major distributors and that was it. And I think it was one in Turkey and then a couple in Russia. And instead of blanketing the market with sales reps, end user demand stimulating activities and distribution, physical distribution centers. So we've gone from a kind of half baked approach to a full-frontal attack on those markets and so that it is a very sustainable approach and we should expect some pretty good growth out of those in regions notwithstanding any geopolitical turmoil that may occur in those very volatile regions in the years to come.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.
Dennis Lange: Shannon thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the second quarter 2017 Stanley Black & Decker earnings conference call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.
Dennis Lange: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter 2017 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Greg Waybright, Vice President of Investor Relations. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our second quarter 2017 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I’ll now turn the call over to our president and CEO, Jim Loree.
James Loree: Okay. Thank you, Dennis. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's news release, Stanley Black & Decker reported a strong second quarter and thus a solid first half as well. Each of our business segments contributed to robust organic growth, which was an impressive 7% for the quarter. Our team's continued focus on delivering top quartile financial performance, innovative products and solutions for our customers along with outstanding execution, resulted in a revenue increase of 10% to $3.2 billion. Results included a full-quarter contribution from the recent Newell Tools and Craftsman Brand acquisition, which supplemented our strong underlying organic growth. Tools & Storage led the way in total growth, up 17%. Up 8% organically. We believe about 2x the market with all regions once again contributing to the continued growth and share gain. The FlexVolt battery system continued its steady march to 300 million, making it the largest, fastest-growing cordless launch in our industry's history. Our tool business keeps delivering and exceeding expectations through commercial and operational excellence, including outstanding core and breakthrough innovation, while at the same time integrating two major transactions. 2017 is shaping up to be another superb performance by the entire global Tools & Storage team. The Industrial segment also delivered a significant outperformance for the quarter. Organic growth accelerated to 9% on the heels of 4% growth in the first quarter. In Engineered Fastening, we continued to see strong automotive system sales, in addition to higher industrial volumes, which supported an impressive 6% organic growth for the quarter. Our other industrial businesses, oil and gas and hydraulic tools – or infrastructure – each delivered 19% organic growth, outstanding performances, as commercial actions plus positive underlying markets benefited both the project and inspection activity within oil and gas and expanded hydraulics tools volumes. And finally, our Security business grew 2% organically, slightly ahead of our expectations. North America Security generated 4% organic growth on stronger installation project activity within the commercial electronic security and automatic door businesses. It is rewarding to see the commercial and operational efforts from the North American Security team manifested in the results. It is noteworthy to point out that this is the highest quarterly growth performance for Security North America since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our overall company operating margin rate remained robust at 15.7% excluding M&A related charges, relatively flat to the post-merger record rate in the second quarter of 2016, and a nice step up of 150 basis points sequentially. The benefits of operating leverage and productivity enabled us to essentially offset modest inflation in price and currency, while we continue to make focused investments on our operating system, SFS 2.0. These investments will support future innovation, organic growth and margin expansion.  Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.01, which is a 9% expansion versus prior year. It was fueled by strong operational execution by our business teams. So, a really great quarter and an excellent first half of 2017. And I want to thank all of our teams around the globe for their energy, enthusiasm and engagement as well as their passion for high performance and results. Based on the company's first-half organic growth performance and our confidence in the outlook, we are raising our 2017 full-year adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.10 to $7.18 to $7.38. Now, turning to an update on the recent acquisitions. Importantly, our progress on integrating the Lennox, Irwin and Craftsman brands into our portfolio is progressing nicely. We remain on track to meet our expectations, both from a financial and integration execution perspective. Specific to Newell Tools, there were some notable accomplishments in the quarter as we continue to assimilate employees, suppliers and customers into our existing operations. In this regard, we are deploying core SFS principles into the production facilities and have begun moving order fulfillment into our Tools & Storage distribution centers, which included a major retail customer implementation in the second quarter. The Lennox and Irwin teams are embracing SFS and are energized now to be part of a larger, highly committed tool business. Our commercial teams are in the process of building plants to support revenue synergies and remain optimistic that a meaningful contribution in that area is ahead of us. In fact, during the second quarter, we have already begun realizing a modest amount of revenue synergy within the emerging markets. And finally, as always, the business teams are working diligently to plan and execute the cost synergies. In this case, $80 million to $90 million. Turning to Craftsman, we're hard at work developing commercial strategies for this iconic powerful brand and remain confident in our ability to achieve approximately $100 million a year in incremental annual revenue growth for the foreseeable future. Our customer discussions are continuing and are going well as we plan for a mid-2018 Craftsman launch outside of Sears. From a supply chain perspective, we have started up a new distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and are aggressively moving supply and customer fulfillment into this facility to support the Craftsman business. As you can tell, there is a large amount of momentum and continued enthusiasm for both of these transactions as the theoretical strategic value of these assets becomes more tangible and more real with every passing day. One last item I'd like to call your attention to is last week's dividend announcement. We increased the quarterly dividend by approximately 9% to $0.63 a share. I’m proud to say that this will be our 50th consecutive year of increasing the dividend and it is a reflection of our continued commitment to deploy approximately half of our excess capital to shareholders and half towards M&A over the long term. I’ll now turn it over to Don for a more detailed assessment of the second quarter results.
Donald Allan, Jr. : Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I’ll now take a deeper dive into our business segments, which delivered another strong performance in the second quarter.  Starting with Tools & Storage, revenues were up 17% in the quarter, due to 8% organic growth and an 11-point contribution from acquisitions which were partially offset by 2 points of pressure from the combined impact of currency and divestitures. The operating margin for this segment was robust at 18.1% as the benefits from volume leverage and productivity were more than offset by growth investments, price and inflation, resulting in a 70 basis point decline in rate versus last year's quarterly record rate. Once again, each Tools & Storage region and SPU posted positive organic growth in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America led the way, up 9%. This strong performance was broad-based as we saw high single-digit growth in our US industrial and commercial channels and low double-digit growth within US retail, which includes our e-commerce customers. Additionally, Canada posted solid organic growth of 7%. The growth continued to be supported by new product introductions, which includes contributions from FlexVolt. I will provide a bit more color on FlexVolt in a few minutes. North America POS data was up mid-single digits, which is very impressive as it comped against mid-teen POS growth rate from the prior year. Additionally, inventory within our major customers were at or slightly below prior year levels, which gives us confidence that our growth has been supported by strong sell-through in the channel. Europe delivered another above-market performance, with the region posting 8% organic growth. Nearly, all markets contributed with double-digit performances in the UK, Benelux, Iberia and Eastern Europe. The European team continues to be the model in our company for commercial excellence. The team has found ways to leverage our broad stable of brands and manufacturing footprint to deliver differentiated solutions for our customers. Finally, the emerging markets were supported by solid performances across Latin America and within Russia, India and Africa, which contributed to overall organic growth of 3% in the quarter. As noted last quarter, we have completed a transition to a direct model in Turkey, which in future periods should no longer be an inhibitor to growth. If we exclude the Turkey transition, organic growth would've been 6% for the emerging markets in Q2. Performance within Latin America varied as double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil and Ecuador more than offset declines in Colombia, Chile and Peru, a trend we have seen throughout most of 2017 and it's reflective of unique country market conditions. Diligent pricing actions as well as the ongoing MPP launch across the developing markets are continuing to drive growth. Additionally, we have seen the e-commerce channel increase its share of the market and become a larger contributor to our growth within emerging markets. As you know, we have what we believe to be leading positions in e-commerce and in developed markets and we are leveraging that know-how as our emerging markets teams work to develop this critical channel for the times. Within the Tools & Storage SBUs, all lines were positive in the quarter. The power tool and equipment group was up 10%, led by professional power tools as well as contributions from the outdoor and home products segment. This SBU also benefitted from new product innovation, including FlexVolt, and continued strong commercial execution. We had another strong quarter for the FlexVolt products, with approximately $60 million. Based on year-to-date results and planned second half FlexVolt product launches, we believe that we are on track to deliver revenue, approaching $300 million from FlexVolt in 2017. When factoring in cannibalization, however, this represents $200 million of SBD revenue or $100 million of growth versus the prior year. Our hand tools, accessories and storage organization delivered 5% growth on new product introductions and benefitted from a strong performance within the North American industrial end markets, led by our Mac Tools business. So, in summary, the Tools & Storage organization continued its momentum in the second quarter, delivering strong above-market organic growth along with robust operating margin of 18.1% as this is an acquisition execution around the Newell Tools and Craftsman Brand, as Jim referenced earlier. Now, moving to the Security segment, Security had a solid second quarter as well, posting 2% organic growth. North America organic growth was up 4%, led by higher installation volumes within the commercial electronic security and automatic door businesses. Europe was flat organically in the quarter as gains in the Nordics and the UK were offset by declines in France. In terms of profitability, the segment contracted 150 basis points year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. The sale of the mechanical locks business drove approximately 120 basis points of this contraction. The remaining 30 basis point decline was attributable to higher levels of installation growth within the quarter, country mix within Europe and a modest level of investment to support future growth. The Security team is maintaining its focus on commercial and operational effectiveness to position this business for future growth and margin expansion. Finally, the Industrial segment had an impressive quarter of outperformance as both the engineered fastening and infrastructure businesses delivered strong organic growth, well in excess of expectation. This topline performance contributed to a 240 basis point expansion in operating margin rate due to the benefits from volume leverage, productivity and previous cost actions. Engineered fastening posted 6% organic growth as the automotive business up low double-digits and a return to our growth in our Industrial business more than offset lower electronics volumes. From an automotive perspective, the growth was led by shipments of our self-piercing rivet and stud welding systems to support our customers' new model launches. Auto fastener sales outpaced light vehicle production by approximately 300 to 400 basis points, showing that we continue to deliver content gains. Finally, the Industrial business delivered approximately two points of organic growth, slightly more robust market growth and commercial actions executed within the business. As Jim mentioned, the infrastructure businesses posted an exceptional quarter, up 19% organically. Our hydraulic tools business is reaping the benefit from its revamped commercial structure and go-to-market strategies, with the backdrop of modestly higher prices in the scrap steel market, which does benefit our product lines. Hydraulics posted 18% organic growth in its third consecutive quarter of organic growth, with higher volumes in all regions. Meanwhile, oil and gas also generated 19% organic growth in the quarter, well ahead of expectations as the industry benefits from an acceleration of onshore pipeline construction activity within North America in the first half of this year. This is being offset by continued low offshore project activity. While the results of the oil and gas business are encouraging, our expectation is that without resumption of approvals by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, also known as FERC, we will see a return to lower level of project activity in the second half of this year. We are pleased by the performances across the portfolio thus far in 2017. We will remain focused on driving outsized organic growth and operating leverage, while integrating the Lennox, Irwin and Craftsman brands within our Tools & Storage franchise. Let's take a look at the quarter's free cash flow performance on the next page. For the second quarter, free cash flow was $134 million year-to-date performance to use of cash of $76 million. The quarterly and year-to-date declines versus the prior year are predominantly explained by carrying higher amounts of working capital relative to the outsized level of organic growth we are experiencing primarily within the Tools & Storage business. From a working capital turn perspective, we delivered 7.1 turns in the second quarter, which is a decrease of 1.1 turns versus the prior year. This decline is primarily due to the impact of our recent portfolio activities, specifically the acquisition of Newell Tools and the Craftsman Brand. Excluding these acquisitions, we were down 0.3 turns versus the prior year. We are confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation in the second half of the year, given our core SFS processes and principles, combined with focused execution on reducing working capital levels in line with Q4 seasonal activity. In addition, we will continue to ensure that we maintain an adequate amount of working capital to support our growth expectation. As a reminder, in 2016, we improved our working capital turns from 8.2 times up to 10.6 times in the second half of the year. In 2017, we expect a similar working capital turn improvement within the second half, from 7.1 times up to approximately 9 times by the end of the year. Therefore, we are reiterating our commitment to deliver 100% free cash flow conversion, supported by this expected strong second half cash flow generation. As a reminder, this free cash flow conversion guidance excludes the impact of gains on divestitures.  So, turning to our 2017 guidance on slide seven. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are also raising our adjusted EPS outlook range for 2017 to $7.18 up to $7.38, which is an increase of 10% to 13% versus the prior year. On a GAAP basis, this results in $8.05 to $8.25 earnings per share range, which is inclusive of various one-time charges and the gains from the first quarter divestitures. The $0.10 increase to our outlook range is the result of higher organic growth than previously expected, about half of which was delivered by the businesses in the second quarter and the remaining half is expected to occur in the balance of the year. Additionally, we are maintaining our combined FX and commodity inflation headwind estimate of around $100 million to $105 million. While currency pressures have reduced since the first quarter, we are seeing increased pressures in commodities, namely steel and some purchase components. I would also like to point out that we expect third-quarter EPS to approximate 25$ to 26% of the full year 2017 EPS guidance. Now, turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, organic growth within Tools & Storage is still expected to be mid-single digits, but modestly improved versus our last outlook. We see healthy construction markets in the US, combined with continued stable European environment and a modestly improving emerging markets set up to continue through the remainder of the year. This should provide the backdrop for share growth, when combined with our commercial actions. We continue to believe that top line growth will translate into an improved margin rate year-over-year. We are maintaining the organic growth view on Security, up low-single digits in 2017. Note that the marginal rate for the segment will be down year-over-year due to the divestiture of the mechanical locks business, which occurred during the first quarter. However, excluding that sale, the margin rate for the year will be flat to slightly down as we expect the impacts of mix and investments to support growth have the potential to be modestly dilutive to the full year rate. Now, finally, in the Industrial segment, we still expect organic growth be relatively flat, but modestly higher than our previous expectation. While we did see outperformance in both engineered fastening and infrastructure again in Q2, as I discussed in the April earnings call, there are market-related pressures which are expected to emerge in the second half. These pressures fall into three areas. One, North America light vehicle production is expected to soften; two, automotive systems which support customer new model rollouts will be lower in the second half of 2017; and three, expected lower project activity in North America for oil and gas, as I discussed earlier. We continue to expect operating margins to improve in this segment, driven by previously identified cost controls, as well as the impact from the first half performance.  We believe we have a solid path to deliver the full-year revised guidance and outperform the broader market from an organic growth and margin expansion perspective. We will remain focused and disciplined in our pursuit of that goal, in addition to successfully integrating our newly acquired tools businesses.  With that, I’ll turn it back over to Jim to summarize this morning's call.
James Loree : Okay. Thanks, Don. So, to recap, the second quarter built upon the strong start to 2017. We continued to deliver above-market organic growth and robust operating performance. And as a result of the continued momentum, we increased the EPS guidance and continue to be excited about the opportunities to deliver value from the recent acquisitions, which are on track. And as we move into the second half now, our deep and agile leadership team is leveraging SFS 2.0 to deliver organic growth with operating leverage, continuing to integrate the Lennox, Irwin and Craftsman brands into our portfolio and generating that strong free cash flow. And we're encouraged by the results through the first half and we're encouraged by our ability to raise the outlook for the full year. We're also vigilant in the pursuit of our three overarching themes, to become known as one of the world's leading innovators, to deliver top quartile financial performance, and to elevate our commitment to corporate social responsibility, all of which supports the company in achieving our 2022 vision. Thank you. And we're now ready for Q&A.
Dennis Lange: We can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
Nigel Coe: Good morning, Jim and Don. Interesting comment about the cannibalization on FlexVolt $3 million growth, $100 million of cannibalization. I’m just wondering if you can just provide bit more color in terms of where you're seeing that cannibalization, what kind of margin mix you're seeing FlexVolt versus the products that are being cannibalized. And then maybe just second half this year and into 2018, how the product rollout [Indiscernible] rollout looks for FlexVolt?
James Loree: Sure. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we see a path now for FlexVolt to be approaching $300 million before cannibalization. And cannibalization impact will bring the number down closer to $200 million net overall for Stanley Black & Decker. What we're seeing is that, as we've been communicating probably now for three to four months, is that we started seeing cannibalization in the spring, early springtime related to certain products that we were replacing on the corded side with FlexVolt technology. So, we still offer those particular products. However, when someone goes in to make a decision about 120 volt product or a 60 volt product, that is now something that can get through FlexVolt, they have a choice to make between the FlexVolt technology or the corded DᴇWALT technology. And so, as we anticipated, we expect to have a little bit of cannibalization and that's what we're experiencing. And we hope, as we end the year, maybe the cannibalization won't be as large as what we projected, but right now that’s kind of what we feel the trend will be at this stage.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. You may begin.
Jeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. 
James Loree: Good morning.
Jeffrey Sprague: Good morning. Just a question on Tools & Storage margin and really kind of a two-part question. First, I was wondering if you could just decompose in a little bit more detail the drivers, product spending and promotions, et cetera, in the quarter. But then, bigger picture, Jim, I was also wondering, clearly, you’ve got a balancing act between revenue growth and OP margin dollar versus margin rate. I was just wondering if you could put that in perspective for us, how you'd think you'd balance those two and maybe what is normalized margin trajectory for the Tools & Storage business?
James Loree: Yeah, I’ll have Don tackle the first part of your question, which I’m not sure he can add too much more color to, but we'll have him address that in a minute. I'll just take kind of a philosophically or from a big picture perspective. When we are pulling those levers on price promotion and margin optimization, trying to figure out where the sweet spot is, I would say, we tend to go in cycles sometimes. The needle will move from one side of the spectrum to the other a little bit. And I would say in the second quarter, in particular, we probably were a little bit more aggressive on price than normal, and so you saw the negative 1% price for the tools segment. That is not something that I necessarily see as a sustainable approach, but it was more of a – a bit of experimentation, especially since our regular promotional activity in the second quarter was a little bit lower. So, we had a fantastic margin performance in the tools business, 18.1%. Somebody was commenting early, before the call, that wow, it's down 70 basis points. Well, it's down 70 basis points versus our highest margin ever in the tools business. So, I wouldn’t get too concerned about it. We have the flexibility to do some experimentation we did. I think you'll see a little bit more of a shift as we get into the second half, particularly the third quarter where we have more traditional type promotions as opposed to price-related promotions. And all of that price activity, I would say, is driven more by us in the driver seat as opposed to responding to anything in the marketplace. Don?
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah, I wouldn’t dramatically add anything to what Jim just said about price. I think that was right on the mark. But I will reinforce that this is probably – if not the second or third highest profitability quarter tools has ever had – I think it’s the second highest they have experienced after last year's second quarter of 18.8. And so – and we just have to keep that in mind and recognize that we're also experiencing some commodity inflation pressure as well, and yet we're still able to achieve that level of profitability. [Indiscernible] and that we don't turn it into something any more significant than what it is, which is relatively insignificant. I do want to make a comment – I didn’t answer Nigel's second question about the profitability related to the shift of cannibalization in FlexVolt. And really, it's not much of a significant impact. It's a little bit of a negative initially here. As we have said before, the FlexVolt margins are a little bit lower than line average throughout this year. We expect as we go into next year for that dynamic to change as we've increased the volume and we also will likely have lower promotional activity as well. But the impact overall is relatively minor and you can see that in the overall operating profit rate of 18%.
James Loree: This is Jim. I'd also like to say that – congratulations to the operations team in Tools & Storage. They’ve done a fabulous job with productivity. We had a series of years where we had design-to-value initiative going, which is now pretty mature. But at this point we're starting to get in pretty significantly into industry 4.0. And that basically involves creating smart factories and then embellishing them with robotics and 3D printing and these types of things. We're far from the robotics and 3D printing phase of it, but we're definitely making a lot of progress in making the factories more data-driven, more real-time in their execution. And what we're seeing is that we're getting above average, above historical average productivity out of this and we expect to continue that as we go forward. So, that's really helping boost the margins as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin.
Richard Kwas: Hi. Good morning, everyone. 
James Loree: Good morning.
Richard Kwas: How are you doing? A couple of quick ones for me. On Security, you talked about investments relative to the beginning of the year and the underlying margin. Was there any change in the underlying performance? I know most of the decrease is coming from elimination of mechanical locks, but if you provide some more color on what's changed since the beginning of the year in terms of incremental investments for future growth versus underlying performance organically? And then the other one real quick is, as you look at the second half of the year, you have a big industrial electronics customer that is coming out with a new product. How should we think about impact to the top line as we think exiting 2017 and into 2018? I know that business has been under pressure for some period of time. Thanks.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yes. As it relates to Security initially, no major changes to our thought process around investments. As we said at the beginning of the year, we're investing a little bit of funds within our Security business to develop a more consistent organic growth profile over the long-term. And we think we are starting to feel a bit of the benefits of that as we saw a quarter with 2% organic growth here within the second quarter, but there's more work to be done in that regard. So, no major shift. I would say there was certainly a little bit of mix pressure this quarter that maybe had a tenths or two-tenths of pressure on the profitability in the segment as we saw a little bit higher mix of installation revenue in the United States and then the country mix over in Europe also was a little bit of a negative, but nothing major. So, I wouldn't say there was anything really underneath that was kind of causing a major shift that's something that’s permanent or ongoing. It's just more of a unique second-quarter type of situation. As it relates to Industrial and electronics, that business for us has gotten down to a relatively small number here in 2017. So, in the second quarter, it was about $6 million of revenue. It's a very small component of that business at this stage for that particular customer. We don’t expect to participate in a significant way in the launches in the back half. We have a minor role with that customer on an ongoing basis and we actually like that position, given the volatility and the profitability of the business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. You may begin.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
James Loree: Good morning.
Michael Rehaut: Just a quick clarification and then my main question. The clarification is just on the Tools & Storage. I was just curious. On the growth investment in basis point impact on margins, just trying to get a little better sense of kind of like the underlying core margin, let's say, in that business as growth investments eventually will moderate as, I guess, you get other – FlexVolt and your other acquisitions more fully running. And then, just on the main question, though, on the – little bit more detail, hopefully, on the change in – what's driving the change in sales growth guidance. You mentioned Tools & Storage and Industrial a little bit better than the last time. Sorry if I missed it, but just a little bit more of where that's coming from in both segments?
Donald Allan, Jr.: Sure. So, I mean, I think on the growth investment side for Tools, that's not a simple number to quantify because there's a lot of different investments across the tools business that are made to stimulate growth in the core business, to stimulate FlexVolt. So, it's difficult to really say how much new growth investments are. And what I would say is that there continues to be areas that we want to pursue, to make investments for future growth and to experience the type of growth that we've had in this business at high-single-digits – anywhere from mid to high-single-digit organic growth on a consistent basis, we have to be making some investments along the way to ensure that that type of trend continues, at least in the midterm. And that's really what you're seeing in the business.  Now, that being said, to all the points we made earlier, the profitability of the business continues to improve. And so, we would expect that when we look at the year-over-year performance of tools here in 2017 versus 2016, we will probably see 40 to 50 basis points of improvement in the margin rate year-over-year, while we're making investments, while we're making other decisions because of some of the things Jim mentioned around productivity, because of other cost management in different areas outside of growth investments, all those different things allow us to manage the business in a certain way and get to a certain result.
James Loree: That’s a really important point, Don, because that's philosophically what we're trying to do, is that we're trying to achieve top quartile organic growth and fueling that with investments and at the same time driving margin expansion. And that's not easy to do, as Don points out, but that is really philosophically what we're trying to do.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yes. The other question was related to change in the organic growth guidance assumption. Yes, we have tweaked our – as I mentioned in my comments in the call, we have tweaked our assumption for Tools & Storage up a little bit versus what we said in April. And the same thing would be for Industrial. Now, Industrial's reason is more because we saw a stronger performance in the second quarter than we were thinking in April. Tools is more of a continued trend of modest outperformance in their organic growth versus expectations and then slightly – certainly, as we get to July every year for our tools business, we get a really nice view of the back half of promotional activities, the beginning of the holiday season, and so that gives us something that we can get a better sense of what we think organic growth will look like. So, based on those various factors is why we tweak those numbers up.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. You may begin. 
Tim Wojs: Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice job.
James Loree: Good morning. Thank you.
Tim Wojs: I guess my question is really on Craftsman. I was just wondering, Jim, if you could talk a little bit about maybe the scheduled launch in the middle 2018, a little bit of color on maybe which product, any sort of dialogue you're having with customers. And then maybe more broadly, any change to how you guys or your customers are thinking about e-commerce at this point?
James Loree: There's a lot of really good things going on relative to Craftsman. I don't want to get into too much detail because it is a competitive situation, but I will tell you that we are working on designing a complete comprehensive product line that spans all categories that it will be a high-quality product line that is high quality, high-value for the customer and will take some of the best attributes of our high-value products from across all our brands and incorporate them into the designs. The channel discussions, the customer discussions are going very well. The interest level is very high. We haven't really changed too much in terms of our strategy. There will be some decisions made in terms of how we expect to go to market from a channel perspective in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter. And then it will be all systems full speed ahead for a mid-2018 launch.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
Joe Ritchie: Hey, good morning, guys.
James Loree: Good morning.
Joe Ritchie: So, maybe just kind of touching on the FX and commodity headwinds of $100 million to $105 million that you forecasted for the year, maybe if you could talk a little bit about whether the pressure you saw in 2Q was more or less what you anticipated.  And then, I'm just a little surprised that we are keeping that at the same number just given that FX has probably moved more positively for you as the years progress. So, any comment on that would be helpful.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Sure. I will take that. Yes, so we started the year with an estimate of around $100 million in total for those two items as a headwind. And at that time, it was about 50-50. So, 50% for FX and 50% for commodity inflation. Back in April, it had shifted more to 60%/40%, 60% being commodity and 40% being the FX.  In the second quarter, that shift continued, where now we think based on current rates, we're probably around $25 million of that $100 million is currency. And the remaining $75 million is commodity inflation. And so, we've seen a continued trend of commodity inflation creeping up through the first six months of the year. We feel like, at this stage, for the remainder of the year, we have our arms around that with various contractual situations with key suppliers that we think we can manage that through the remainder of the year within a relatively small number. So, we don't expect that trend to continue. And if FX continues to go in the direction it has been, there might be a potential for that $100 million to be a little bit smaller by the end of the year, but we'll see how things progress at this stage. So, that gives you a little bit of the evolution and the history and where we are today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. You may begin.
Robert Barry: Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning.
James Loree: Good morning.
Robert Barry: Just I guess a couple of questions on tools volume and to reference your comment earlier on pricing experiments. How much volume do you think you picked up in tools this quarter with the price picking down one? And then, just a follow-up on the FlexVolt comments, it seems like the broader tools business is doing better and the momentum there is better. It seems like the outlook for FlexVolt should be kind of sharing in that, to the extent that end markets helping there. Any comments there on just how you're thinking about that outlook for FlexVolt versus the broader tools market?
James Loree: We haven’t changed our outlook for FlexVolt pretty much all year. We've been consistent with that, $300 million minus the $100 million for cannibalization. And feel good about that. We have a whole family of new SKUs coming out here in the next couple of months that’s going to support continued growth in FlexVolt against comps that begin to get tough as we start to get into the September, October, November, December time frame. So – and Don, I think, hit the cannibalization subject pretty hard earlier. So, I think FlexVolt is a good story. It's going to be really good. And it's going to be supportive of the $300 million number growth. And we'll see what happens when the new SKUs come out. If they're really successful, that will be – it will be great. And then we have the fact that we have no answer yet in the marketplace to FlexVolt and we're almost a year in now. So, this is about building an install base. A battery system is about an install base. And getting that install base built means that it creates the foundation for future growth and future expansion. And if you recall, the whole concept of FlexVolt is eliminate cords from the job site. And the more speeders [ph] we can come out with over time where people use that battery system will be a definite competitive advantage here as we go forward. So, we're very excited about FlexVolt. We're thankful that the innovation was protected well enough, so that it could not be leapfrogged in short order. And I think it would be foolish to think that, sooner or later, a competitor or competitors won't come out with an answer of some sort, but the answer we've seen so far, which is 9 amp hour, 18 volt clearly has not been the answer to FlexVolt. Going to the – how much did the 1 point of negative price drive volume in tools? I think the volume has been pretty steady in kind of that 5% to 7% range all year. And frankly, for quite some time. And I think it's probably safe to say that maybe we got a point out of it or something like that at most. And so, the conclusion we've drawn is that the business runs nicely at a 5% to 7% kind of threshold or range of growth. And when we start pushing it up into the 8% to 9% range in total, it starts to put strain on the factories and the supply chain and freight and cost and things like that. So, we're probably better off running it in the 5% to 7% range to the extent we are able to do that without any significant pricing kind of promotion in that regard. So, I think that's pretty much about what we can say about the experiment. We're excited about the third quarter promotional calendar, which is something that we normally do in the second quarter. So, stay tuned.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Belfiore with UBS. You may begin.
Chris Belfiore: Good morning, guys. Yeah, I just kind of have a follow-up to that kind of comment there and question. I mean, in terms of just the back half for Tools & Storage, I mean, a little bit better than mid-single digits, just trying to figure out where – it seems like it needs to kind of slow down from a volume standpoint. But, like, you just said there's promotional things going on in the third quarter. So, kind of how like price and like volume kind of pare out in the second half, any color on that?
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yes. So, certainly, the comps are getting tougher as we get into the back half of the year. So, we've got to keep that in mind. But based on our current outlook, you're probably looking at a second half that’s going to be around 6% organic growth for Tools & Storage. And so, it's kind of right in the middle of that – Jim just described, the sweet spot of the business currently today. Runs very well in that range of 5% to 7%. It might have a slight slam to 7%. We'll see how the year ends up, but it's kind of in that range of 6%, maybe up to 7%.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. You may begin.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, guys.
James Loree: Good morning.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Yeah. Not to beat FlexVolt to death, but, I guess, could you just, Jim, run us through some of the thoughts on cannibalization, just given that the dollar mix or I guess the price point is so much higher for FlexVolt versus corded. And I think even on the battery line, much higher as well. And maybe try to weave some of the commentary by inventory turns in that. I think a lot of what you saw last year and even in the early part of this year has been mostly channel fill versus turns. So, just how are those turning through the market and I guess, like I said before, how is that factoring into the price mix on FlexVolt relative to that cannibalization number?
James Loree: First of all, let there be no confusion that the sell-through on FlexVolt is excellent. And really, it's not about growing inventory in the channel. The early first month or two obviously was sell-in as a result of a startup of an initiative. But the sell-through has been excellent and continues to be very strong. So, let me just put that one to bed. I think the one point that you really – you hit it on the head with FlexVolt is this is about share of wallet when it comes to cannibalization. And you have two wallets. You have the end users' wallet and you have the channel wallet. And that’s what makes it so difficult to really predict what the cannibalization will be because, at the end, there's only a finite demand for power tools and there are competitive power tools out there and then there are power tools and there's FlexVolt. And we can't really analyze at this stage and may never be able to fully analyze what the impact is on cannibalization because of those various share of wallet items. And I think that you hit on the head was FlexVolt is more expensive. So, to the extent that people are buying more units of FlexVolt, they are more challenged to buy 20 volt or 18 volt type products in the marketplace. So, I don't think there's any clear or easy answers to the question, but what we're to monitor this is we're actually looking at point-of-sale in the non-FlexVolt areas, corded and cordless. And we haven't seen any dramatic decreases at this point in time, but I think we do see some decreases at the margin, and that’s all we can really quantify. So, we'll keep an eye on it. We'll report back as we learn more and more, we do more analysis over time. But it's going to take several quarters before we can really pin down exactly what the impact is.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. You may begin.
Ken Zener: Good morning, gentlemen.
James Loree: Hey, Ken.
Ken Zener: Taking that same line of questioning and adjusting a little bit, given your comments and that's a finite universe in terms of the SKUs, redefining the market is something Stanley has done very well and DᴇWALT in its history did very well. And ever since your analyst day, I’ve been just constantly referencing back to Jeff Ansell's discussion around what FlexVolt is and where can it go. The idea that you're targeting small gas engines is something that is resonating with me. Not only because that’s a new market for you, but also because of the savings you generated through the Black & Decker acquisition. Your margins today are nearly double a lot of your peers. So, are you too busy with Newell, with Craftsman to consider that proposition? What are your limits, I guess, because that's the real story behind Stanley is going into new categories, leveraging your operating platform versus others and acquiring a brand that’s already established?
James Loree: First of all, I would say that Craftsman brought many positive elements to the table. One of them is that it's complementary to exactly what you're talking about because prior to Craftsman we did not have a large gas engine or small gas engine lawn equipment power initiative. We did have the string trimmers and those types of things, but they were electric. So, this gets us into gas. And we're learning a lot about lawn and garden, as we speak, and we are experimenting with the application of DC brushless electric motor technology to lawn equipment. And we do think that there is a big future. But there are some technological breakthroughs that will have to occur relative to the cost of doing that. And so, there's a lot of work going on there. And the answer to the question, are we too busy with Craftsman? Actually, this is part of our busyness with Craftsman.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Redner with Bellman & Associates [ph]. You may begin.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning.
James Loree: Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst: I had two quick questions on the Tools & Storage segment. First, on the Newell side, I think you guys alluded to a retail load-in. And I just wanted to clarify that the prior guidance had no revenue synergies embedded in it. And then secondarily, your largest domestic customers, at least their stock prices have been impacted by some of the e-commerce plays that have unfolded in the home-improvement category.  Given that you guys sell to e-commerce as well as these large retailers, I was just curious to get your view on – if you think the pie in power tools as well as overall home-improvement is big enough for an e-commerce entrant as well as the legacy home centers to survive as you look out?
James Loree: I’ll take part two. Don can figure out a little bit more about part one and probably ask one clarification on that. But let me cover part two. So, we as the largest tool company in the world, and as Don mentioned earlier, have taken a pretty aggressive stance in terms of making sure that we participate in the e-commerce opportunity and I’ll call it a transformation. And, of course, e-commerce has its limitations. However, we would be foolish to think that it's not going to be a substantial part of the market in the years to come. It already is a substantial part of the market. And as was mentioned earlier, we, back in 2010, elected to enter the e-commerce market in the US and we did it not only with traditional e-commerce players or player, but also with our traditional customers, especially the home centers. And the traditional home centers are forces to be contended with as it relates to e-commerce. My guess – I would never ever comment upon the health or survival of our large customers, but I would say that both home centers embrace e-commerce. And I think they have certain advantages and certain advantages relative to the pure e-commerce players. And therefore, without getting too much into those, but you think about omni-channel and the advantages that brings, and you look at the recent purchase of Whole Foods, and you scratch your head and say why did that happen, I think if you start to envision how omni-channel could play an important role in e-commerce. You could see an unfolding scenario that says there can be successful pure players and successful omni-channel players. And maybe it all gravitates towards omni-channel at some point. So, I think there probably are going to be lots of changes as time goes on. We are really well-positioned, largest e-commerce player in the tool industry by an order of magnitude, probably as much as an order of magnitude. And have developed skills and capabilities that we share readily with all our customers that are interested and now, as Don mentioned earlier, also internationally into the developing countries in Europe and the other developed countries in the world and the developing countries. And I think in the developing countries, what's interesting about e-commerce is that it will enable us in certain areas, such as China, where we don't have number one market share to take a fresh look at how does one go to market in that type of – with that type of an opportunity to leapfrog maybe traditional distribution channels. So, very, very interesting space. We've done a lot of analysis and review of e-commerce in the last year or so. We're very comfortable with our strategy there. And we look forward to that being a major growth driver for us as we go forward across our customer base.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. So, the first question you had I think was around – Jim made a comment in his opening remarks about Newell and moving certain inventory from one DC to another, and that was really just part of the integration plan. There was no load into a customer. You might have misinterpreted those comments. It was really moving from one of our DCs to another to improve the service fill rate levels because when we initially acquired Newell, fill rates were much lower than what we would want them to be. And so, we've been aggressively – the Tools & Storage team has been aggressively working on this since the first day of acquisition and has made significant progress in that regard. But there hasn’t been any load in or anything into our customers related to new products. It's simply part of the integration, something that we had on the plan before the closing occurred. If that doesn't answer your question, feel free to call Dennis and Greg and they can clarify anything else you had.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. You may begin.
Michael Wood: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I’ll just shift gears to Security. Now that you’ve made your strategic decision there for the segment, just curious if there is opportunity to tweak any country by country exposure or are you with that portfolio now? And also, if you can just give some comment on the 2% of the acquired recurring business, if that was opportunistic or we should expect that to continue going forward?
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yes. So, I'll take that one initially and Jim can add new color on the first part of your question. Right now, we actually feel pretty good about the country makeup of the Security business. We don't see any countries that are major concerns for growth and profitability. We do watch that on an ongoing basis and evaluate it every year as part of our strategic update planning process. There are a few small countries in Europe that over time we have to decide, can we build a level of substance in infrastructure within those country that make them a player, whether either number one or number two in the marketplace, because we have a few smaller ones right now that are not in that position. If that didn’t play out the way we wanted to, then that could be something we evaluate in the future. The second part of your question, yeah, we occasionally do these opportunistic RMR acquisitions in our security – electronic security business where we see them as nice additions to the portfolio, that integrate right into our infrastructure, and we will continue to look for those at the right price and the right financial returns.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. You may begin.
Michael Wood: Yeah, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the good quarter.
James Loree: Thank you.
Michael Wood: Just to pick up on the European – on the Security business, I was wondering if you can just talk about the European security business in particular. And you provided some outlook through 2017.  But looking further forward in 2018, can you just talk about your growth prospects and has perhaps something changed competitively? And then, if I could just add one quick one on – you called out Mac Tools as a source of strength. I know you added some storage product initially there. Was that what was driving the growth or you’ve seen something else that’s driving Mac's strength?
James Loree: Yeah. On Mac Tools, this has been an ongoing, multi-year, steady execution, improvement. We have a difficult relative market share position. So, it makes it that much more challenging. But we've added trucks. Our sales per truck, every year there, they're are improving dramatically. And it's just a kind of a more slugfest over time. A steady slugfest. And even with all that, we're getting kind of mid-single digit growth. We had a pretty good quarter this quarter, a little better than usual. But it's basically three yards and a cloud of dust in Mac Tools. That’s the way that businesses is for us. We love it, but it's not going to be an 80-yard wide receiver touchdown in one quarter. So – and with that, I’ll have to – Don, you can tackle the first part.
Donald Allan, Jr.: Yeah. So, Security Europe, specifically around organic growth, we had said for Security in general, and it applies to Europe, is that we believe it's a business that right now based on its current makeup, it can grow organically 2% to 3% on a consistent basis. And Europe had demonstrated that type of trend up until this year, where they’ve seen a little bit of pressure in France, which is one of their larger markets that we think is just more market related and one time in history in the sense of – it's just really impacting this year. But we still think that’s the right growth prospects for the business both in Europe and globally. But more importantly, as you’ve heard at our investor day back in May, we have to continue to work on the next evolution of Security, which is getting into other areas that are very unique solutions that specialize touch to a customer at higher value and ultimately add to more positive mix to this business over the journey of the next three to five years plus. And so, we need to do both of those things. But I think that’s the type of thing that maybe could move the business beyond 2% to 3% organic growth. But right now, that roadmap is not completely defined, but certainly well underway.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. 
Dennis Lange : Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
End of Q&A: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

It is therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim?
Jim Loree: Thanks Greg and good morning everyone. As you saw the first quarter was an excellent start to 2017. All our businesses came out of the gate strong with each contributing to our robust 5% organic growth for the quarter. Revenues were $2.8 billion, up 5% versus prior year on strong organic growth. Tools & Storage continued to lead the way up 6% in the quarter with all regions contributing. Industrial posted a large positive top-line surprise with 4% organic growth on strong automotive system sales in Engineered Fastening and solid performance from the Infrastructure businesses which are finally beginning to see signs of life in their various end markets. This is an eight point positive sequential swing for the segment. And while it's still too early to conclude definitively, we're cautiously optimistic that we may begin to see the positive trend continue as the year progresses. Don will provide some more color on that when he goes through the segment details and our updated 2017 outlook in a few minutes. Finally, our Security business started the year off right posting 1% organic growth in line with our expectations. It was good to see the top-line expansion driving impressive operating leverage throughout the P&L expanding our operating margin rate by 110 basis points to a record first quarter rate of 14.2% excluding M&A related charges. This reflects our consistent focus on operational excellence as evidenced by a 160 basis point increase in our gross margin rate overcoming an adverse impact from currency and some commodity inflation. Diluted adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.29, as strong operating performance, more than offset the aforementioned currency and commodity headwinds, higher restructuring charges as well as an unplanned event based environmental charge related to a pre-merger closed facility. On top of these excellent financial results, we also closed three major capital allocation transactions in the quarter. Finalizing our acquisition of new tools, our acquisition of the craftsman brand, as well as the divestiture of our commercial hardware business, which I'll address in more detail in just a moment. Finally, based on the strong start and our improved outlook for the Industrial businesses, we are raising our 2017 full-year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to $7.08 to $7.28. This is inclusive of the previously disclosed impact of the three transactions I just mentioned and will be covered by Don later during his remarks. Turning to our recent portfolio activity and what made for a very busy quarter here, the Newell Tools acquisition with the iconic Lenox and Irwin brands closed on March 10, the day after the Craftsman deal closed. As you would expect our experienced integration teams are up and running full speed on the Newell integration and building out the Craftsman brand. On Craftsman the majority of our efforts are now focused on supply chain activities to initially support sales into non-Sears Holding channels. In parallel, we are developing commercial strategies for the brand and remain very excited about the potential growth opportunities. We continue to see a clear path towards annual growth of approximately $100 million a year for the next decade. Our initial conviction has only been reaffirmed since closing, as numerous customer interactions continue to substantiate our growth assumptions. This is reinforced by the powerful name recognition and consumer buying intent associated with the Craftsman brand. Suppliers are also positive about the opportunity to participate in reinvigorating the growth of this iconic brand. As expected, there is a lot of excitement and positive energy around our stated intention of bringing manufacturing for the Craftsmen brand back to the United States. Our plans for a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility are starting to take shape, so look for more to come on this front in the coming quarters. And as previously we expect the Craftsman brand transaction to generate approximately $0.08 of earnings accretion in 2017 excluding charges buildings of $0.35 to $0.45 accretion by year five. On Newell Tools our focus is now on integrating employees, suppliers, and customers into our existing operations. The team is focused on achieving the substantial cost synergies identified during due diligence. And as a reminder, we expect to achieve $80 million to $90 million in cost synergies with this deal, and will also soon begin tapping into the significant revenue synergy opportunities. Overall customer feedback has been extremely positive with many customers voicing a desire to expand the relationship and add new product lines. Work is well underway to accommodate these expansions including new distribution channels for the Lenox and Irwin brands into previously underserved markets where Stanley Black & Decker has a strong and established footprint. We continue to expect Newell Tools earnings accretion of approximately $0.24 per share in 2017, excluding charges, building to approximately $0.80 by year five. So as you can tell, we are excited about the prospects for these acquisitions, both for the strategic benefits as well as their financial impact. Regarding the total company, we believe we are set up well for a strong 2017. As always, we benefit from our deep and agile leadership team, our commitment to and focus on operational execution and our robust SFS 2.0 operating system. We're also benefiting from relatively stable exchange rates and for the first time in four years, we are not facing escalating FX headwinds at this stage of the year. The result is a healthy start to 2017 with a focus on maintaining the momentum behind our organic growth and margin expansion efforts, while also tapping into the significant value opportunities presented by Newell Tools and the Craftsman brand acquisitions. I'll now turn it over to Don for a more detailed discussion of first quarter results. Don?
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I would like to take a deeper dive into our business segments, which all performed very well in the first quarter. Tools & Storage revenue was up 9% in the quarter, as 6% organic growth and four points of acquisitive growth were offset by a point of currency pressure. The operating margin for this segment was up an impressive 16% year-over-year to 16.4% operating margin, as the Group achieved strong operating leverage and a solid top-line growth. Each Tools & Storage region and SBU posted positive organic growth in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America led the way and was up 8%. This strong performance was due to our U.S. commercial and retail channels which were up low-double-digits and high-single-digits respectively. Additionally, Canada posted solid organic growth of around 10%. New product introductions and successful field conversions drove growth in the commercial channel. Strong e-commerce volumes and continued momentum from the FlexVolt launch, field growth in the U.S. retail channel as we did overcome some modest channel inventory tightening. We expect the momentum surrounding FlexVolt which by the way did meet expectations for the quarter will be maintained and bolstered by our commercial teams launch strategy, which has a well-designed roadmap of promotions and new FlexVolt tool and accessory SKUs hitting the shelves regularly over the next few years. North American POS data remains healthy throughout the quarter, as it was up high-single-digits. This is particularly impressive given we were comping a mid-teen POS growth rate in the first quarter of 2016. The above-market growth trend in Europe continued in the quarter, with the region posting 6% organic growth. The outperformance was widespread across the region with almost all markets contributing. The European team continues to provide picture perfect examples of commercial excellence at its finest driving mid-teens growth on average among its top 10 customers in the quarter. Additionally, in the first quarter, we continue to see customer wins in the UK and strong market share gains in Italy and Iberia. Finally, the emerging markets were up 1% organically, as solid performances in Latin America and Asia were weighed down by continuing but improving pressure in the Middle East and North Africa. We are undergoing a transition to a direct model in Turkey which will weigh on growth within that region for the first few quarters but should ultimately provide a much better mid to long run opportunity in that country. Performance in Latin America was mixed with double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador more than offsetting declines in Colombia and Argentina. Asia delivered strong performances in Korea and Japan which more than offset pressure we saw in Thailand and in the Philippines. The diligent pricing actions that we've been taking as well as the ongoing MPP launch across the developing markets is continuing to drive growth. Just one last comment on emerging markets. We are really beginning to see a lot of excitement from our customers around the potential future Irwin and Lenox rollout, more to come on that later this year. Within the SBUs, all lines were positive in the quarter. The power tools and equipment group was up 9% led by power tools and home products, both of which benefited from new product rollouts and continued strong commercial execution. Our hand tools, accessories, and storage organization delivered 3% growth on a strong performance within hand tools and storage, which benefited from a bounce back in industrial end markets. The overall industrial businesses within Tools & Storage were up mid-single-digit. In total, the Tools & Storage organization continued its momentum in the first quarter delivering solid above market organic growth and robust operating leverage driving 110 basis point margin expansion, while at the same time accelerating integration and commercialization efforts around the Newell Tools and Craftsman brand acquisitions. Let's move to Security. The Security segment had a nice start to the year as well, coming in right on top of our expectations posting 1% organic growth. North America, organic growth was up 2%, its highest organic growth quarter since the second quarter of 2015 led by higher volumes within automatic doors, which continues to perform very well as well as solid healthcare growth. Europe was flat organically in the quarter with mixed results across the markets as gains in the Nordics and UK were offset by declines in France and Central Europe. In terms of profitability the segment contracted 120 basis points year-over-year but was relatively in line with our expectations. The sale of the Mechanical Locks business which was finalized in the quarter drove approximately 70 basis points of that contraction, as this was an above line average business. The rest of the operating margin rate decline is a combination of channel mix and strategic investments within the sales organizations of Europe and North America. On the whole, the Security segment delivered a solid quarter starting the year on the right foot from an organic growth perspective, at the same time executing seamlessly on the Mechanical Locks divestiture. Additionally, they had a strong orders trend in the quarter and therefore backlog is positioned well going into the second quarter. Now turning to Industrial. We are extremely pleased with the segments outperformance this quarter as both the Engineered Fastening and infrastructure businesses delivered positive organic growth in excess of expectations. This top-line performance generated significant operating leverage and drove a 180 basis point improvement in operating margin rate for this segment as volume, productivity, and cost action more than offset currency headwinds. Engineered Fastening delivered 4% organic growth on a strong performance from the automotive business up low-double-digits, which more than offset lower electronic volumes, which were down 20% for the quarter. Auto fasteners sales continued to outpace light vehicle production numbers globally by a ratio of about 2 to 1. Additionally auto system sales were also a highlight in the quarter, up significantly versus the prior year on the back of previously won business beginning to translate into new model production. The Engineered Fastening team posted a record operating margin rate in the quarter in the low '20s as top-line growth combined with recent cost out actions delivered significant operating leverage. The infrastructure businesses posted a solid quarter as well in their own rights, up 2% organically. Our hydraulic tools business which has been revamping its commercial execution and go-to-market strategies for the last year or so is starting to see some momentum build posting its second consecutive quarter of organic growth due to higher volumes across all regions. Meanwhile, oil and gas was flat in the quarter but also ahead of expectations as this industry begins to experience accelerated onshore pipeline construction activity within North America. However, this is being offset by a continued low offshore project activity factor. While there is still lot of risk and uncertainty in our operating environment today both geopolitically and economically we are very encouraged by the collective performances across the portfolio in Q1. As we move deeper into 2017, we will remain focused on driving outsized organic growth and operating leverage, while also integrating the Newell Tools and Craftsman acquisitions into our world-class Tools & Storage franchise. Now, let's briefly take a look at the quarter's free cash flow performance on the next page. We were down slightly year-over-year mainly attributable to higher working capital as the large swings in net income and other were primarily driven by the gain on Mechanical Security divestiture. As a reminder, the outflow of cash in the first quarter is normal seasonality for our Tools & Storage inventory levels rise to ensure we are adequately prepared for the Q2 and Q3 demands of our key customers in the developed markets. However, keep in mind working capital turns in the quarter were up 0.9 turns versus the prior year when you exclude the impact of the portfolio move, a very solid start to the year. We remain on track to deliver 100% free cash flow conversion for the full year. Just a reminder, this guidance is excluding the impact of the gains on the recent divestitures. Now let's turn to our 2017 guidance. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are raising our adjusted EPS outlook for 2017 to a range of $7.08 to $7.28 which is an increase of 9% to 12% versus the prior year. On a GAAP basis, this results in a range of $7.95 to $8.15 earnings per share, inclusive of various one-time charges and also the gains from the first quarter divestitures I previously mentioned. This $0.10 increase to our outlook comes through as a combination of slightly higher organic growth within our industrial-related businesses which contributes approximately $0.08 and incremental cost and productivity actions of $0.10 primarily within Tools & Storage. In the aggregate, this more than offsets the previously mentioned one-time first quarter environmental charge of $0.08. Additionally, we are maintaining our combined FX and commodity inflation headwind estimate at $100 million to $105 million. Additionally, we still expect $50 million of core restructuring for the year. However, keep in mind that $50 million is inclusive of the $12.5 million charge we took in the first quarter relating to the settlement of a legacy Canadian defined benefit plan. Finally, note that we expect second quarter EPS to be approximately 27% of the full-year 2017 guides. Turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page organic growth within Tools & Storage is still expected to be mid-single-digits as healthy construction markets in the U.S. combined with a relatively stable Europe and a still volatile emerging market setup should allow us to continue to take share around the world. That top-line growth will translate into improved margin rate year-over-year. We are maintaining the organic growth view on Security as well up low-single-digits in 2017. Note that the margin rate for the segment will be down year-over-year as we begin the process of lapping comps inclusive of the Mechanical Locks business just divested this quarter. Excluding that sale however, the margin rate for the year will be flat to slightly positive. Finally, we are raising the top-line outlook for our industrial segment from previously down low-single-digits to now relatively flat. It's still little too early in the year to make any more aggressive predictions in this space, but we are seeing some positive signs, both in the Engineered Fastening end markets as well as within the infrastructure businesses. We continue to see operating margin improvements in this segment driven by the previous identified cost actions, but also due to the improved revenue outlook. As I noted before, there is still quite a bit of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty across our operating landscape in 2017. However, we remain cautiously optimistic as we are seeing signs of growth across all segments of the business in the first quarter and we believe we have a solid path to delivering the full-year revised guidance and outperforming the broader market from an organic growth and margin expansion perspective once again. We will remain focused and disciplined in our pursuit of that goal, particularly as we integrate and begin building momentum within our newly acquired tools businesses. With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim to summarize this morning's call.
Jim Loree: Thank you, Don. Well as you've heard Stanley Black & Decker is hitting on all cylinders. The first quarter represented a solid start to the year as we continue to build on the momentum underlying our organic growth and margin expansion initiatives. As a result of the strong operating performance and a reasonably favorable operating environment, we raised guidance excluding charges and the gain on sale of the Mechanical Security business to $7.18 at the midpoint, a 10% increase on a year-over-year basis. Apart from our focus on organic growth, we're very excited about the opportunities to drive value within the Newell Tools and Craftsman brand acquisitions. And as I mentioned earlier, integration activity is well underway for both transactions and we received nothing, but positive feedback from all constituencies. And finally, I want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Day in the morning of May 16 in New York City. This will be a great opportunity to communicate our strategic and financial objectives and discuss the next chapter in the Company's evolution. We're also looking forward to showcasing numbers of our business unit and other key functional teams and we look forward to seeing you there. We're now ready for Q&A, Greg.
Greg Waybright: Great, thanks Jim. Chelsey, we can open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Chris Belfiore with UBS is online with a question.
Chris Belfiore: So I guess I just wanted to kind of -- kind of touch a little bit on the strength you guys in industrial -- in Industrial segment the Engineering -- the Engineered Fastening business with the automotive systems performance there. Is this something that can kind of be like lumpy through the year? Just kind of, I know you said you're kind of looking to see well how things are going to play out and that's why the organic pressure is still at relatively flat for the year. But I mean that wouldn't kind of imply that it could be may be more first half weighed than second half weighed just getting to like the -- the annual guidance there. So is it kind of a lumpy thing or is it specific like a project.
Don Allan: Sure, this is Don. It is somewhat lumpy in the year where we do have like we experienced in the first quarter, we'll probably have a similar dynamic in the second quarter around system sales within Engineered Fastening but in the back half right now, we really don't see a lot of those types of system sales occurring as a lot of the new model launches are happening here in the first half of the year, back half of the year. Right now, that's not the case so that's part of the reason that we're being a little more prudent and balanced in our view of the full-year for that particular business. Those dynamics can change a little bit every once in a while, but at this stage, we think that's the most appropriate perspective of the full-year.
Operator: Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities is online with a question.
Rich Kwas: Hi, two questions. One, I guess Don on just a follow-up on the industrial question from a mix standpoint what are you assuming for auto for the back half of the year when you look at from a production standpoint, there is some concern with North America and may be even China, that things slowdown. And then just a broader question for Jim around the manufacturing facility for Craftsman how are you looking about the expansion into the U.S. with the new facility, given that there seems to be increased uncertainty regarding the VAT and that sort of impact on your manufacturing position. Are you -- how committed you are or do you, are you committed to what I should say, and then any implications from anything that doesn't go on tax wise?
Don Allan: Okay. I'll start with the first question, Rich, and continuation of the previous question, which on the automotive business with Engineered Fastening, we do see a really some strong growth here in the first half of the year, just like we experienced in the first quarter. But right now, we do see light vehicle production slowing in the back half in particular North America but even slowing in some of the other regions compared to what we expect to experience in the first half. So that's part -- that is really what's kind of factored into our guidance when we look at first half versus second half in the industrial business, in particular, we have a combination of the -- the auto systems, and then you have a secondary factor of just a slowing of production in the back half of the year versus the first half based on current projections.
Jim Loree: Okay. And then on the second question, and just to reiterate how committed are we to our USA manufacturing strategy related to Craftsman given the uncertainty, but certainly the lower probability of the implementation of a border adjustability tax. And frankly we just comment on that that it's good just see that the government seems to be coming around on that one and understanding that that is not a good idea for the United States of America and many, many companies within the United States as well and really pretty much everywhere. So offsetting that aside for a minute as it relates to the facility expansion plans there was never a contingent on a VAT being implemented, it was really a function of the strategy for re-Americanizing Craftsman and just so everyone is aware we manufacture about 30% of all tools that are sold in the United States of America today and we are able to cost effectively do that with today's manufacturing technology and our intent is to increase that for the total tools business including Craftsman but in particular Craftsman. We have 11 tools plants in the United States and those tool plants, probably the majority of them will be expanding capacity in addition to the facility that we've discussed. And in the end it maybe -- it maybe more than one facility in the U.S. we will have to see how it all shakes out, but we're looking at various scenarios, so answer to your question we're very committed to manufacturing in the U.S. for Craftsmen and for the rest of our United States sales.
Operator: Saliq Khan from Imperial Capital is online with a question.
Saliq Khan: Yes, with the increasing strength in your Tools & Storage metrics, what are you hearing right now from your distributors and your channel partners about the state of your product offerings. But also have you've been able conduct a review of the talent as well as the temperament of all the employees within the recent acquisitions.
Jim Loree: Would you repeat the first part of your question, please?
Saliq Khan: Sure. If you take a look at the strength that you have within the Tools & Storage business what you've been hearing from the distributors and the channel partners about the state of your product offerings?
Jim Loree: Okay. We're going to have Jeff Ansell tackle that one since he is right on the job.
Jeff Ansell: Thank you. To this point that the response that we received from both end-users and trade customers globally has been outstanding, they want favorability on the Craftsman news was 90%. From Irwin, Lenox or Newell Tools perspective similarly positive feedback from customers and employees. So they want to be onboard 3,200 employees to our system seamlessly and we spoke with over 1,000 customers in the first 48 hours of the integration and the feedback has universally been great brands, great opportunities they have struggled free acquisition Newell Tools they struggled to serve their customers in terms of availability of products, service levels. And that's the number one thing, the customers have said to get that right and we can grow this business. And I'm pleased to say that in the first -- less than the first month of ownership, we've improved that backlog position reduced it by over 70%. So we've met the number one objective of the customer. So the feedback from our customers has been outstanding globally and from employees as well and we think it really strengthens our portfolio and opportunities to serve our customers unlike anyone in the world.
Operator: Jim Ritchie from Goldman Sachs is online with a question.
Evelyn Chow: Hi, good morning. This is actually Evelyn Chow on for Joe Ritchie. How is it going guys?
Jim Loree: Great, Evelyn.
Evelyn Chow: I was hoping if you could just give us an update on your gross margin performance, which has been incredibly strong not just this quarter but really for the past four, is there anything kind of significant happening at anywhere internal actions, mix, maybe just any other items that are kind of driving that kind of year-over-year expansion?
Don Allan: Sure, I will take that. But there's nothing unusual, I think it's a continuation of all the things that we do under the SFS 2.0 operating system model which is focused on appropriate pricing actions, driving cost productivity, transforming our back office et cetera, et cetera all those different things, commercial excellence where we're really trying to make sure that we're providing new products at the right price points to gain market share all that that entire operating model is really what drives that on an ongoing basis. So when I look at the first quarter in particular, you've got that dynamic of just continued trend of trying to drive operating leverage as we grow. And so the way that we drive operating leverage as we grow is that we look at various things excuse me that I just described but then we also try to reinvest along a portion of that along the way, so we can continue to stimulate future growth. And so we don't necessarily let all the leverage drop through but we had a large part of it drop through along the way. And the only way you're going to get operating leverage is to do the things that I just described, which is focused on pricing mostly focused on cost reduction, driving productivity for the supply chain offset any inflation that you're experiencing et cetera, et cetera. So you combine that with a factor that this is the first year we don't have $200 million of currency pressure. We have a number that's 50-ish roughly on an annual basis at this point, all those factors combined with that are resulting in a continued trend of strong gross margin.
Jim Loree: And Jeff why don't you tackle that same question and give them a little insight into how you think about it in the Tools business as well?
Jeff Ansell: Sure Jim, thank you. Inside of Tools, if you look at last year's period this time last year, we had grown about 8%. This quarter in the emerging markets, we grew another 7% in total 6% and as you know Tool P&Ls volume are very volume-dependent. So with that volume growth, it's given us a lot of degree to freedom inside of our supply chain, it's driven great productivity, while at the same time, tremendous quality improvements drove -- lowering our warranty return rates and the volume growth that we've had has been profitable growth meaning we targeted specific promotional opportunities in specific categories, seasonally adjusted for the right retail environment around the world and we've been successful. And in addition to that, we fought around the world with all this currency pressure we faced now for four years to be very, very frontal facing there. And if you look at places like the UK, we grew 16% this quarter, 8% was volume, 8% was price given what's going on there. And so if you take all those things into account, we better served our customers and in the same time been more reliable and more profitable while we've grown the business at unprecedented levels.
Jim Loree: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Tim Wojs from Baird in online with a question.
Tim Wojs: I think I was on mute there. Good morning guys. Nice job.
Jim Loree: Good morning, thank you.
Don Allan: Thanks, Tim.
Tim Wojs: Hey just on I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the discussions that you're having with customers just around Craftsman and the distribution strategy there now that you guys know that asset, maybe where the most interested and just how do you leverage the entire Stanley Black & Decker portfolio to really benefit kind of drive the maximum benefit for the total company?
Jim Loree: Jeff?
Jeff Ansell: I will take that. So it's really too early, early to declare the commercial strategy, we are that is not to say we're not working on it. We're working on it feverishly and we have been since March 9. But what we could tell you early read from this process is, we have an incredible demand for the Craftsman product across our U.S. customer base even in some other international geographies like the UK and Australia but in particular in the U.S. In terms of its opportunity within our stable of brands, if you look at our absolute share today although we are number one by all accounts and growing faster than the market, we still only we own about 20% of the total global market. So 80% of it is still out there for us to go after across 10 or 11 different marquee brands. And if you -- if you look at Craftsman in particular, it still represents nearly a couple of billion dollars in the marketplace today. And while we have grown our Tool business from $600 million to over $8 billion that Craftsman franchise has survived and that tells you what a loyal installed base that is, the customer however says that they would much prefer to find that brand in a lot of other more convenient locations. So our opportunity to take an installed base we've unable to dislodge make it available across other -- other retail options is exactly what the customer is asking for and we'll give a little more clarity May 16 but not full, we are working feverishly on this and as soon as we are able, we will tell you more about it, we can't wait to get started.
Operator: Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan is online with a question.
Michael Rehaut: Couple of quick -- couple of questions if I could squeeze them in, first if you could give any update on the M&A landscape particularly in terms of what you're seeing from a pricing standpoint, what people are asking and if you still see valuations are reasonable and should we think about timing that 2017 and perhaps some of your other segments are something that's possible or if you know you're going to be focusing mostly on Tools & Storage. And then just secondly on the breakthrough innovation front, any update there as you look at your other segments augmenting what you've done so far in FlexVolt. Thanks very much.
Jim Loree: Hey, Mike. First of all on the M&A landscape we just spent $3 billion or almost $3 billion and are integrating feverishly as Jeff says, two major acquisitions in Tools. So this is going to be a year of digestion for the most part and I think everybody should understand and can understand why that would be both from a financial balance sheet point of view as well as an operational bandwidth point of view. So having said that, I would say the pipeline for M&A is about as robust as we've ever seen it with valuations and in its own, I think is manageable with good synergies not cheap by any stretch, but some really interesting strategic assets out there that are of a decent sized, decent enough to move the needle. So we're coming through those right now and doing a lot of analysis and thinking strategically about what makes the most sense. We may do some very small acquisitions yet this year but there won't be -- there won't be anything which I would call material in size but be on the lookout in as we get into next year for something in all likelihood in one of the other segments, other than tools wouldn't rule tools out, but I would say that in all likelihood, it would probably be in either industrial or security which is where we see the action today. So that's the M&A picture, we can talk more about that at the Analyst Meeting for people that are interested. As far as breakthrough innovation I have never been more excited about the opportunities that we see across the company and we have about 10 teams up and running. We have every business in the company has at least one team and our emerging markets group has a team and we're all using all those teams are using the same formula that we use for FlexVolt under the global Tools & Storage model that we have identified as part of SFS 2.0. So you'll see more information about that at the Analyst Meeting, but I can tell you that we don't expect a 100% batting average on these. But I would think that if we have 10 teams up and running and have been up and running now for us anywhere between a year-and-a-half to six months in that timeframe, there will be some innovations coming out of those teams that we've already seen some. One of the challenges for us will be some of those require commercialization in places or in ways or channels that we don't necessarily have access to today. So another one of our challenges related to breakthrough innovation will be getting some channel access to for some of these innovations that are a little bit out of the fairway, if you will. And I think you see a combination of human resources additions to tackle those challenges as well as some integration of M&A activities with our breakthrough innovation activities and synergizing up both of those. So really exciting times here at Stanley Black & Decker as far as breakthrough innovation goes.
Operator: Dennis McGill from Zelman and Associates is online with a question.
Dennis McGill: Hi, thank you guys. I was hoping you could may be expand a little bit on the first quarter margin within Tools & Storage I think going into the quarter extracting both currency and brand investment to be some pressure on margin and a very strong margin performance there so little color there. And then as you look at the full year the positive year-over-year some different factors going on, especially with the acquisitions specific to Craftsman can you just maybe put some numbers around it given the royalty payments and things might impact margin there and how we should model that business?
Don Allan: Sure. So let's start with the first quarter gross margin, which was, as I said, very strong. We clearly did experience commodity inflation in the quarter, we experienced some year-over-year FX pressure as well, but we did have some nice pricing benefits Jeff mentioned some of things that we've done in particular in Europe and some other markets around the world that have been positive for us, he is referring more the last year, but we also some saw some of the impact this year in the first quarter. And then we also had focus on cost actions and productivity that came in very nicely throughout the quarter and then we -- we put a little bit investment back into the P&L. So I think the probably difference was as we didn't put quite as much investment back in the P&L as we originally were anticipating at the beginning of the quarter, but frankly, the rate was not dramatically better than we anticipated it was just modestly better. As far as Craftsman goes this year as we said it about $0.08 of EPS impact for us. The margin impact will be relatively modest, not a big number. There is a, which many of you're aware of their accounting aspects related to the royalty stream or the free royalty basically that we provided to Sears that does have an annual impact. This year that will drive frankly a large part of the operating profit here in 2017. And then as we move into 2018 and beyond it will be more about the activities associated with driving organic growth, driving more profitability in the business through our supply chain in our manufacturing etc cetera, etc cetera. And so I wouldn't expect a large number here in 2016 -- 2017 I'm sorry based on what I just described and also just keep in mind, a large part of the operating margin will come from that accounting dynamic.
Operator: Robert Barry from Susquehanna is online with a question.
Robert Barry: I had a question on Tools margins, I guess in two parts. I mean big picture up over 100 basis points in 1Q. I mean do you think you can maintain something close to that degree of kind of year-over-year progress, a lot of those drivers, you mentioned seem like they could carry forward. And I think you were expecting even better performance in the back half due to lower launch costs. And then just kind of a sub-question related to Newell synergies what's the cadence of that $80 million to $90 million of cost synergies. I think that was by year 3. How much is coming in 2017 versus in 2018 and 2019. Thank you.
Don Allan: Yes, so the gross margin, yes the trend I expect. I expect the trend to continue throughout the year. Can I guarantee every quarter will be perfect based on what we did in Q1? Absolutely not. But because there is timing of when we make investments and various other factors, but the Tools & Storage business right now, although they have some headwinds, the headwinds aren't quite as large as what we've experienced over the last few years. Currency is much lower number; commodity inflation right now is a reasonable number. We'll continue to watch that as the year progresses. But in total, those numbers are about $100 million to $105 million with a large part of that, probably 80% of that hitting the Tools & Storage business. So when I think of the business trend and as I mentioned as I went through guidance I think the trend is going to continue to be accretive year-over-year as we go throughout this year. And I want to say be of the same magnitude every quarter based on what we had in Q1. So we definitely expect solid accretion. As far as Newell cost synergies we as Jeff mentioned, we've just started that process and about 30 days good news is we had a fair amount of planning, leading up to the closing over about a 90 to 120 day period of time. So we were ready to go day one, and which was -- which is always great to be an acquisition, and so this year, we think we're probably going to get about $20 million to $25 million of cost synergies from Newell in 2017. And the rest of it will kind of pace a little evenly over the next three years. So that would be what you should expect for 2017.
Operator: Liam Burke from Wunderlich is online with a question.
Liam Burke: On the industrial tools side of the business Jim, you mentioned strength was that across the board or were there any particular verticals that did well?
Jim Loree: I'll let Jeff tackle it since he has got industrial tools under him.
Jeff Ansell: We were up strong mid-single-digits about 7% in the industrial business that was pretty pervasive across all of our industrial tools businesses. The Tier 1 folks were up double-digit in the -- in the quarter. So that recovery looks -- looks promising and we believe our growth in that market certainly with a share gain more than just a market improvement although the market did improve concurrent with our Q1 results. We did -- we did see some, some industrial tools folks actually exit the market, which we very quickly converted over to our brands, which was fantastic. So things like that as well as the flexible introduction in those industrial channels has been really high, really well done well accepted in that technology really performing in that marketplace so all those things come together for a market that has improved a little more than we expected and our growth is greater than that market itself. So that's kind of the way we see it going forward.
Jim Loree: So Jeff while you're on the topic of FlexVolt may be you could just expand a little bit on the program right now. I know there is a little skepticism out there from a couple of people who probably have a vested interest and skepticism. So why don't you just tell give them the ground fruit about FlexVolt right now.
Jeff Ansell: What tends to be in this marketplace competitors are violent and if your competitors don't have a response they tend to -- they have a negative view on what you -- what you're doing and how it's performing. The reality is we couldn't be happier with FlexVolt and if you think of 7% growth in this first quarter 8% in North America, 6% in Europe. We're very pleased with that. But half that growth came from FlexVolt half came from the core, so what it says, our core business vibrant we comped a very big quarter from last year and grew the core at the same time while allowing FlexVolt to provide the other half of the growth. Our retail execution of FlexVolt is now more than double-digits ahead of what the customer expectations work, which is fantastic. And the uptick and uptake in industrial channels every bit is good if not better. So if you consider those things and you look to the fact that we are loading new flexible products as we speak in this quarter and we will continue to load new introductions throughout 2017. And as Jim said, in the next several years that has been the real, the real driver behind what you do with this breakthrough innovation team. We have to continue to keep this fresh and we feel that we are quite, quite nicely doing that. The last point I would tell you is, while it takes time to introduce new systems and power tools the fact that this does leave the old system behind has led to a much faster adoption than most new power tool platforms. As such, our growth in FlexVolt, the ramp in FlexVolt is 10 times faster than the ramp in brushless as an example. So we couldn't be more pleased and we are we know it's a competitive advantage and the average of five stars. The average user rating of FlexVolt is 4.9, so if you get the product right for the user everything else takes care of itself. So we feel great.
Operator: David MacGregor from Longbow Research is online with a question.
David MacGregor: Yes sir, good morning and congratulations on a good quarter.
Jim Loree: Thanks, David.
David MacGregor: Yes, thanks. Just around FlexVolt if you could may be go back to Jeff and just talk about the development of 16 and 120 volt cordless tools and then how should we think about kind of the growth performance and the timing of those products?
Jeff Ansell: Well, the beautiful thing about FlexVolt is we are able to develop 20 volt tools where they're appropriate, where the max watt outperformance is appropriate. At the same time, develop 60 volt tools where the max watt outperformance is required and obviously there is a cost difference right the 60 volt tool is more expensive proposition for the user and for us that delivers unprecedented performance, at same time the user wants the right tool for the right job, at the right cost. So all those things come together and what you'll see over the next 36 months we'll be presenting this to Jim and team in the next few weeks and then you'll see some of it at the May 16 session, you'll see fresh introductions of both 20 volt and 60 volt tools coming within the FlexVolt range and I will tell you that the users pick up on them has been equivalent. The user likes what they can do with FlexVolt batteries under 20 volt system but they really have also embraced the 60 volt performance. Circular saw in particular is absolutely killing it. The portable you mentioned 120 volt, the portable products like miter saws which are 120 volt absolutely killing it. So the user has embraced all those various platforms and because it gives them the performance of coated in a cordless package. So more to follow but yes we are very, very active in development of 20, 60 and even 120 volts going forward.
Operator: Robert Wertheimer from Barclays is online with a question.
Robert Wertheimer: Congratulations on getting all the deals done, obviously a lot of work and rapidly done. On Craftsman is there and what's your sense of scenarios and contingencies if Craftsman at Sears declined for whatever reason faster than expected. Do you have a current channel to absorb it; do you think that the additional channels you might add are going to be in place in the near term?
Jim Loree: I think we're planning for a more rapid ramp than $100 million a year over 10 years. We can probably handle a ramp with our current planning at about 2X rate of that clearly that's hypothetical at this point in time and it's a contingency but it's certainly definitely something that we are planning for in the event that that were to occur.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Greg Waybright for closing remarks.
Greg Waybright: Chelsey thank you. We would like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call and obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Stanley Black & Decker Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew and I will be your operator for today’s conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.
Greg Waybright: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker’s fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings call. On the call, in addition to myself is Jim Loree, our President and CEO; and Don Allan, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning’s call will also be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. And consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 1934 Act filing. I’ll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.
James Loree: Okay. Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter performance put a ribbon on a great 2016, during which the company continued its above market organic growth trajectory and delivered record operating results for EPS, cash flow, operating margin rate, and working capital turns. Before I cover the highlights for the quarter and the full-year, I want to take a moment and recap what turned out to be a tumultuous year in the external environment, characterized by some of the most profound geopolitical and economic developments around the world that we have seen in quite sometime. You might recall that, we entered 2016 in a low growth and slowing world, albeit with a relatively healthy U.S. construction market and a solid global auto market. The remaining U.S. industrial backdrop was negative. Europe was anemic, emerging markets were slowing, and increasingly volatile. We witnessed extreme government turmoil in Brazil, Venezuela, South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines among others, a failed coup attempt in Turkey, and increasingly hawkish Russia, people continued in the Middle East, the UK voted to leave the EU, and negative interest rates were experienced across a large part of the developed world. Global currency devaluation cycle persisted, where the U.S. dollar rising to the highest level we have seen in 14 years, not to mention a brutally divisive political season here at home, amazing, and that was the abbreviated list. Against this backdrop, we delivered a record-breaking year by almost all measures. From operating margin rate to EPS to free cash flow and working capital turns, this organization reached new heights in 2016. On top of that, we rolled out the largest and most successful product launch in tool industry history the DEWALT FlexVolt system. We executed a seamless CEO transition and significantly reshaped the business portfolio towards high growth and profit expansion opportunities through the pending acquisitions of Newell Tools and the Craftsman brand. Actions which will bring with them exciting prospects for the future, which I’ll touch upon shortly. But first, I’d like to thank every member of our management team for their outstanding contributions and performance, while navigating through these challenging times. It is our people to whom we attribute these accomplishments and successes. It is our extraordinary dedication, passion, teamwork, and sheer will to win that makes this company so special. We entered 2017 with a great deal of optimism for what lies ahead despite the obvious uncertainties and challenges that accompany these times. Now, I’ll take a moment and provide a brief recap of our fourth quarter results. Revenues were $2.9 billion, up 3% with solid organic growth of 4%, partially offset by a point of currency pressure. Tools & Storage continued to lead the way posting 7% organic growth, with positive contributions from all major geographies and SBUs, as well as a healthy boost from the rollout of FlexVolt. Security wrapped up a solid year of overall performance improvement with another quarter of margin expansion. And finally, although industrial revenues were down 4%, this was slightly better than expectations, given that our Engineered Fastening business continues to be impacted by lower volumes associated with one major electronics customer. Excluding that impact, industrial organic revenues were flat. Don will provide you with a deeper dive into business level operating performance during his remarks. EPS for the quarter was a $1.71, down 4% versus a very strong 4Q 2015, and as anticipated, higher restructuring costs, growth investments, and currency pressure more than offset good organic growth, a strong operational performance and a lower tax rate. Now, let’s turn to the full-year highlights. 2016 represented another year of progress toward our long-term strategic and financial objectives. Full-year revenues were $11.4 billion, up 2% and 4% organically. Our operating margin rate expanded 20 basis points to a record 14.4%, with a strong performance, which overcame $155 million of pre-tax FX headwinds. We achieve full-year EPS of $6.51, a 10% increase over 2015, and a new high watermark for Stanley Black & Decker. Our team delivered an outstanding free cash flow performance, generating $1.14 billion in 2016, with a record 10.6 working capital turns for a free cash flow conversion rate of 118% of net income. And for those of you who have followed us over the long-term, you know that double-digit working capital turns has been a stretch goal for, at least, a decade, with legacy Stanley Works, nearly hitting the mark prior to the Black & Decker merger, and after that, we redoubled our efforts and are pleased to have reached this goal in 2016. There’s logic to our fanatical drive to increase working capital turns. I’d make this observation. When we began the Stanley Fulfillment System or SFS in 2006, our trailing revenue was $3.3 billion and our working capital was $700 million. If our turns should remain constant over the ensuing years, we would have begun 2017 with $2.6 billion of working capital and $11.4 billion of trailing revenues. Instead, we had only $1.1 billion of actual working capital tied up at year-end 2016. Thus, through core SFS, we freed up approximately $1.5 billion of cash over the years, about half of which was returned to shareholders and half reinvested in productive growth assets. And finally, during 2016, SFS 2.0, our enhanced operating system, which we introduced early in 2015 broke into full execution mode. Through SFS 2.0, we drove significant growth, cost efficiency, and digital transformation, the working capital performance I just mentioned and a successful global launch of FLEXVOLT, our first of its kind breakthrough innovation. The FLEXVOLT launch has been extremely well received by customers and end users, with revenues exceeding our initial plan and delivering slightly more than $100 million of revenue in just four months of 2016. We expect to more than double this in 2017 with a full-year of revenue as well as more FLEXVOLT tools to be introduced this year. And although, this is not a point forecast, we are capacitized to over $400 million in revenue. So you could expect us to be somewhere between 200 and 400. 2016 was a tremendous year for the company by almost all accounts, and 2017 is shaping up to be another one, particularly in light of SFS 2.0, as well as our recent portfolio announcements. It’s been a brisk return to M&A since I took over, beginning with our acquisition of Newell Tools announced in October. We followed up in December with the announced sale of our Mechanical Locks business and then followed that a few weeks later with the agreement to purchase the Craftsman brand from Sears Holdings. I’d like to take a moment now to review the acquisitions, highlight the outstanding opportunities for revenue growth and EPS accretion that this portfolio is reshaping and capital redeployment have created. The Newell Tools acquisition with its Irwin and Lenox brands and the Craftsman deal will result in the addition of three extraordinary brands to our already strong portfolio. It will extend our reach in the plumbing and electrical trades, as well as the auto mechanics channel, the power tools accessory space, and the outdoors products in garage storage markets. The net result will be a significant revenue growth opportunity through investing in the brands, innovating the products, and leveraging our global manufacturing footprint, and commercial capabilities. You can see the baseline financial impact on the chart in the lower right hand corner. We anticipate that these deals will drive a significant increase in EPS over the next 5-plus years, as they are fully integrated. They are accretive from the start and will contribute well over a $1 per share by year five. One point that I do want to address is around our current portfolio weightings and the reality that these deals increase our weighting in Tools & Storage. I stressed that from a strategic perspective, our intent is to continue to drive the overall company business model as a high-performing diversified industrial. And to that end, these transactions do not signal a deviation from that intent, but I’m more reflective of the timing around when they came to market. The Newell Tools business and the Craftsman brand are highly attractive and we’ve had our eyes on it for many years. And while we may have preferred that they came to market with a little more daylight between them, you played a hand that you don’t when it comes to deal actionability. And accordingly, we tapped into our strong financial position to acquire these assets even if it meant being slightly overweight in Tools for a period of time. And when you think about it being overweight and a business performing on all cylinders is a kind of problem that you’d like to have more of. These transactions and the exceptional growth and profit opportunities they represent, along with the existing strengths of our business, such as SFS 2.0 and FLEXVOLT, make it easy to get excited and bullish on the future here at Stanley Black & Decker. We have positioned the organization for success with a deep and seasoned leadership team, a long-standing strategic vision guiding the way, and an enhanced operating system SFS 2.0 driving improvements in organic growth and cost and asset efficiency. The combination of which leaves us poised to deliver differentiated performance in the future just as we have done in the past. And now, I will hand it over to Don Allan, who will walk you through segment performance, overall financials, and 2017 guidance. Don?
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. Let’s transition to our segment performance for the fourth quarter. Tools & Storage delivered another stellar quarter posting organic growth of 7%, with all regions and SBUs contributing. North America led the way up 8% on the back of strong performances in the retail and commercial channels, primarily driven by the continued success for the DEWALT FlexVolt roll out, as well as other new product introductions. We also saw some upside in the industrial channels for the first time in a few quarters, with a group delivering low single-digit growth due to a solid performance by Proto and several meaningful wins within our storage business. Europe delivered another quarter of above market growth coming in at 4%, which is slightly below the high single-digit trend we have been seeing from the region, but still a very healthy performance for that part of the world. Almost all European markets contributed positive growth as the continued success from the DEWALT FlexVolt launch across the region, coupled with ongoing robust commercial excellent actions within the markets, such as the relaunch of the DEWALT brand in France. We also had continued key customer wins in the UK and enhanced e-commerce initiatives across the region, that contributed to this top line performance. The emerging markets team delivered a strong quarter as well, with 7% organic growth fueled by gains in Latin America and Asia, which more than offset continued pressure in the Middle East and North America – North Africa. The Asia team posted mid-teens growth in the quarter to wrap up a year of double-digit gains and outstanding performance, as commercial excellence actions and major wins with our Stanley branded MPP power tool offerings continue to drive growth in the region. Latin America finished the year strong up high single digits, as growth in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil more than offset the continuing pressure in Peru and Colombia. While it is probable that 2017 will bring continued volatility in emerging markets, we are encouraged by the team’s performance on the ground, and their ability to execute actions quickly and effectively when presented with challenging macroeconomic conditions. We’re also excited about our continued digital investments across the entire Tools & Storage business, which are well underway. As we leverage the digital excellence pillar within SFS 2.0 to enhance our connectivity to and experience with end users around the world. The Tools & Storage operating margin rate was down as expected about 40 basis points in the quarter, as currency mix and growth investments more than offset the favorable benefit of volume leverage, price, productivity and ongoing cost management. In summary, the Tools & Storage organization delivered an outstanding fourth quarter and full-year performance in 2016. We greatly appreciate their efforts and are pleased how they have positioned themselves well to maintain this momentum and repeat the success in 2017. Moving on to Security. Security wrapped up the year of meaningful forward progress, posting flat organic growth in the quarter, while continuing to improve its operating margin, up 30 basis points over the prior year quarter and up a 140 basis points for the full-year. This improvement in profitability as a result of a more disciplined approach to new commercial opportunities, coupled with continued progress and field efficiency and effectiveness. The North America and emerging market businesses grew organic revenue modestly by strong performance in emerging markets combined with solid performance in automatic doors more than offset lower commercial electronic security volumes. The business continued to improve field efficiency and profitability in the quarter and we are pleased with its continued positive trajectory. Security Europe’s organic revenues were down slightly in the quarter, as installation volume declined in France and the UK, more than offset continued growth in the Nordics, Germany and Ireland. The UK continues to be impacted by a slow installation market in the financial services industry. 2016 was a year of strong operational performance for the Security segment, as a whole. The teams combined to increase the operating margin rate to approximately 13%, which was a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year. Additionally, the segment delivered a point of organic growth, as it continued to make progress towards becoming a consistent organic growth contributor. We also concluded our strategic review of this segment, paving the way for further progress toward our mid-term goals of delivering consistent low single-digit organic growth and mid-teens operating margin. Our industrial segment performed slightly ahead of expectations, down 4% organically in the quarter with our Engineered Fastening business down 2 points organically on the back of continued comp pressure from a major customer in the Electronics segment. However, absent that customer, the business was up a strong 4% in the quarter, as automotive remains healthy and the industrial business swung back to positive growth. The infrastructure platform was down 12% as pressure within our oil and gas business more than offset a solid organic performance within hydraulic tools. This is the first growth quarter in Hydraulic Tools that we’ve seen in quite some time. In total, top line pressure in the industrial segment and the associated deleveraging led to an operating margin rate contraction in the quarter versus the prior year. However, the business did an admirable job of driving productivity and cost reductions to partially offset the top line declines throughout the year, bringing a healthy full year 16.5% operating margin rate despite the large macro and top line pressures experienced through 2016. All-in-all the segments wrapped 2016 in solid fashion with tools and storage exiting the year on a throughput, security reinvigorated to continue its forward progress, and the industrial segment is well poised to manage the likely lingering market and customer pressures in 2016. On top of this strong P&L performance, we were able to drive significant working capital improvement resulting in a record free cash flow performance for the year. Our full-year performance was excellent. And you can see that we generated a record $1.14 billion of free cash flow in 2016. This was driven by significant improvements in net income and working capital, which were up $83 million and $155 million respectively. With the positive impact from the timing of various other miscellaneous payments captured in the line referred to as other, more than offsetting an increase in CapEx spend. This performance resulted in a conversion rate of a 118%, well above our expectations for the year, underpinning this outperformance, for working capital turns of 10.6 times, up 1.4 turns year-over-year and a significant milestone accomplishment for the organization as we exceeded 10 turns for the first time in our company’s history, a goal we had established almost a decade ago. We have a laser like approach to managing working capital within standby Stanley Black & Decker. It was a core component of our long-standing SFS operating system and it continues to be a key pillar of our enhanced SFS 2.0 operating system. On that note, we are very excited about the opportunity to drive working capital improvements within the pending Newell Tools acquisition. This will create additional cash flow benefit opportunities from working capital in the coming few years. Now let’s move on to our outlook for 2017. We are targeting approximately 4% organic growth in 2017, very similar to what we experienced in 2016. And we expect our earnings per share to be from $6.85 up to $7.05, which is approximately a 7% increase versus the prior year at the midpoint. And we expect the free cash flow conversion to approximate a 100%. Note that these earnings estimates exclude the impact from our recent portfolio announcements. As these transactions closed during 2017, we will adjust our guidance accordingly. However, at this time, we believe the most appropriate view is the one we presented here today. You can see on the left hand side of the page that we expect the organic growth of 4% to generate approximately $0.45 to $0.55 of the EPS accretion. The next guidance factor is related to commodity inflation and currency headwinds. We estimate commodity inflation to be approximately $50 million to $55 million and currency headwinds will approximate $50 million based on current spot rates. These two headwinds combined are approximately $0.50 to $0.55 of EPS pressure. In terms of operating margin sensitivities for 2017 relating to our top key currency exposures, which are the Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound, Brazilian real, and the Argentinian peso, they are actually relatively consistent with those that we just published in mid-2016. And then finally, we expect the net impact of various cost and productivity actions, which will be partially offset by higher share count to result an accretion of $0.45 to $0.50 per share, rounding out the $6.85 to $7.05 guide. I would also like to review three miscellaneous guidance matters. First, we continue to anticipate approximately $50 million of core restructuring charges, which is very close to our running average for the last few years. Second item is we are forecasting approximately 151 million of shares outstanding for 2017, and finally we expect the first quarter earnings to be slightly below 17% of the full-year performance, which is below the prior year percentage, but that is due to higher level of restructuring in the first quarter, higher currency, and higher shares as well. So let’s turn to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. We expect tools and storage to post mid-single-digit organic growth in 2017. This will be driven by strong geographic performance in most regions around the world with share gains expected to continue in the U.S., Europe, and Emerging Markets. We anticipate that the DEWALT FlexVolt battery system will continue to be highly successful in 2017 accounting for approximately 1.5 points for the incremental growth. As it relates to profitability, we expect the tools and storage business to deliver an improvement in its margin rate year-over-year in-spite of the previously mentioned commodity inflation and FX pressure that will predominantly impact this segment. The security segment will continue its positive performance trajectory in 2017 hosting low single digit organic growth, and driving its operating margin rate higher through operating leverage gains, cost containment, and productivity actions. With the strategic review concluded for this segment, the business teams are looking forward to continuing their performance momentum into 2017 and beyond. We expect to deliver profitability improvements in both Europe and the U.S., while also making solid progress on the organic growth front. Over time as we have previously stated, we believe that this business has the potential to be a solid and consistent organic grower, approaching the low end of our 4% to 6% total company target range, while delivering a mid-teens operating margin rate. 2017 should be another year of progress towards that goal. Finally, we expect the industrial segment to post a low single-digit organic decline for the year and to improve its operating margin rate through cost actions productivity and strategic SG&A management. While the overall automotive business within engineered fashion remains healthy, we still have some residual comp issues related to one major electronics customer, and we expect some continuing modest pressure within the industrial channel to content with. Within the infrastructure platform, we expect that slight improvements within the hydraulic tools business will be more than offset by top line pressures in oil and gas, which continues to see little to no new activity in the offshore space and limited projects onshore in 2017. We hope this deal of the business and improves based on some of the recent actions, which have occurred at the federal government level. In total, we expect the sum of these performances to translate into a slight top line decline with room to the upside should one or more of the underlying markets rebound in 2017. I want to spend a minute now going through some additional details related to the recent business development activities that Jim touched on earlier. As I stated earlier, the financial impact of these transactions is not included in the guidance I just provided. In October, we announced the acquisition of Newell Tools, including the highly priced Lenox and Irwin brands for a 1.95 billion purchase price. This deal marked the end of our nearly three-year M&A hiatus, during which time we significantly enhanced our operating model and organizational capacity, while driving meaningful improvements in organic growth and profitability. The Newell Tools transaction materially enhances our presence in the power tools accessories space, while also expanding our footprint in the plumbing and electronic trades. These areas are core adjacencies for Stanley Black & Decker and there is a rich opportunity to drive significant cost and revenue synergies in the near term by leveraging the same operating techniques that made the Black & Decker deal so incredibly valuable, albeit, this will be on a smaller scale. The transaction has cleared HSR review in the U.S. and is pending certain non-US regulatory approvals. It is expected to close within the first quarter. EPS accretion, excluding charges is expected to be approximately $0.20 to $0.25 in 2017 assuming this closing date occurs in the first quarter. In December, we announced the conclusion of our strategic review of the security segment. We decided to retain the commercial electronic and automatic door businesses and sell the majority of our mechanical lock business to dormakaba for $725 million. This reflects the healthy EBITDA multiple of approximately 14 times. The transaction will be extremely tax efficient with net proceeds expected to be approximately $700 million. As we noted at the time, we believe there is tremendous opportunity to grow and innovate within the commercial electronic and automatic door spaces. These businesses have a very natural and organic fit together with the latter providing an important vehicle to host certain technological innovations, which are a key component of our differentiated electronic monitoring value proposition. In addition to the otherwise attractive and under penetrated market it serves. However, given the suboptimal side and sale of our Mechanical Locks business the value it attracted in the market and the tremendous business development opportunities at hand it became fairly obvious to us that redeploying this capital was the best way to maximize value creation for our shareholders. Once we made that decision we went to work very quickly to ensure that successful achievement of that outcome. We expect the sale to close in the first quarter of 2017 and to be dilutive to 2017 earnings of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 EPS. Assuming Q1 closing for both of these transactions, on a combined basis they will be accreted by $0.05 to the 2017 EPS guidance I just communicated. Finally, we kicked off 2017 with the exciting news that we have reached an agreement with Sears Holdings to purchase the iconic Craftsman brand. This deal gives us the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and sell Craftsman brand of product in all non-Sears Holdings channel worldwide. The purchase price is comprised of two cash payments one at closing and one at year three a $525 million and $250 million respectively. Plus it has a series of annual payments from year 3 to year 15 for an estimated total present value of purchase price of approximately $900 million. We expect this transaction to drive approximately $100 million of average annual growth or between 50 basis points to 100 basis points of organic growth year end and year out for the next decade. The closing is expected to occur during 2017, EPS accretion will be approximately $0.10 to $0.15 in year one, excluding charges and then increasing to approximately $0.35 to $0.45 by year five and then eventually to approximately $0.70 to $0.80 by year 10. One final point on the Craftsman deal, we have received a number of questions regarding the limited lifetime warranty that customers of Craftsman products enjoy today. Our intent to keep this warranty intact assuming we are successful with our purchase of the Craftsman brand. So as you can see there’s a lot to be excited about going into 2017 and beyond. And with that, I’ll hand it back over to Jim, for the summary.
James Loree: Thanks, Don. Yes warranty is a big part of the essence of the Craftsman brand and it will continue to do so as you point out in the future. So in summary, 2016 was a really good year for Stanley Black & Decker. Solid organic growth of 4% and a strong operating performance combined to deliver new records for EPS cash flow operating margin rate, and working capital turns. The DEWALT FlexVolt launch is a great story and it is still early days. All signs point to that momentum growing throughout 2017 and well into the future. In addition to the organic successes we reentered the M&A sphere in a decisive and exciting way announcing the acquisitions of Newell tools and Craftsman. We adhere to our strategic principles by objectively evaluating our security business ultimately deciding to divest Mechanical Locks. We executed a tax efficient transaction to do so at a great price enabling us to monetize the asset and redeploy the capital into higher growth profitability activities. Finally we’ve established 2017 guidance for EPS within a range of $6.85 to $7.05, a 7% increase at the midpoint on a solid 4% organic growth outlook. And that is without any net accretion from the announced transactions, which will be significant and additive when the deals close later in the year. And I’d like to make the point that much has been made of the FX and inflation headwinds that we are facing in 2017. Our view is that this is the best setup that we’ve had in three to four years the time when we overcame $400 million to $500 million of FX headwinds. And during that period we have maintained a consistent record of meeting or beating expectations and we see that record continuing in 2017. We expect to maintain the momentum we built in 2016 as we carry forward into this year with a FlexVolt launch still in the early stages, the security business reenergized and moving forward SFS 2.0 in full swing and the anxiously awaited additions of Newell Tools and Craftsman. 2017 promises to be another inspiring and rewarding year for Stanley Black & Decker. We remain humble and committed to driving exceptional shareholder value again in 2017. Thank you for your support and Greg we’re now ready for questions.
Greg Waybright: Great, thanks, Jim. Andrew we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen the question-and-answer queue is now open. [Operator Instructions] First question for the day will be coming from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is open.
Timothy Wojs: Hey, guys good morning. Nice job on a quarter.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
James Loree: Thank you.
Timothy Wojs: I guess just on the Tools business, could you start just by helping us a little bit with the teams through the year. I know you have a little tougher comparisons in the first-half versus the second-half. And how we should think about FX in the raw material inflation kind of hitting margins through the year?
James Loree: Sure. We’ll start with the organic revenue kind of – if you prefer to do a cadence by quarter, I won’t go quarter-by-quarter. But I think if you think about, kind of a mid single-digit organic growth for the full-year, we actually think that the first-half will be pretty strong and be slightly above that 5%, as we have things like positive momentum on FlexVolt and some other introductions and innovations that are occurring. And then as we get closer to the end of the year, fourth quarter, particular the number probably would be slightly below 5%, that’s probably a directional trend that you can look at. As far as currency, we see a lot of that currency happening in the first-half and a much lesser amount occurring in the back-half of the year. And then the commodity side of things will be more evenly paid throughout the year. We’ll have less lumpiness to it, because a lot of that is really things that are – trend that we’ve seen emerge in the back-half of 2016 and then based on the way that a lot of our contracts are laid out that we’re rolling off in the first-half of the year. So I would say more of an even facing of that, but maybe a little bit of a tick up in the back-half.
Timothy Wojs: Great. Well, good luck on 2017.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague: Thank you. Good morning.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague: Jim, I’d like to pick up towards the end of your closing comments, which were kind of more strategic portfolio in nature. These tools assets obviously are in the sweets spot and that you wanted to think that makes them look so attractive here. And it sounds like some of your stuff was on your radar screen, as you think about what we said about diversifying the portfolio or kind of going down other portfolio vectors, do you have a good sense of where you want to go, not expecting to name assets. But are there things on a chess board somewhere in your office so to speak that are a little bit of a roadmap, or is this something that would be more opportunistic over time?
James Loree: Well, I’d like to think it was as sophisticated as a chess board. But yes, we have some ideas. The first thrust is to continue to strengthen the franchises all three of the major franchises that we have, so security, industrial and tools. And that’s – logically why we – these assets and tools came up, we pounced, because they do make tremendous sense as consolidating transactions for us, and in effect, particularly the Newell Tools been kind of a bolt-on type – and the Craftsman being more of an organic growth machine. So when – part of this is when transactions become available in the segments that we’re in, we take serious looks. And so, for instance, in Engineered Fastening, we love to acquire something. We love that business. We don’t particularly like the – how the electronics part of it has played out. But that’s relatively small piece of it and that will be – and getting smaller as the days go on. But the automotive piece and then there’s an Aerospace segment within Engineered Fastening that we are very underweight in. That – these types of businesses that are similar to Engineered Fastening same or similar to an Engineered Fastening. So a lot of application engineering upfront, good high value added for the customer base, recurring revenue stream, and in some cases even an after-market. That that type of a business model is something that we said that we like a lot. And so if something were to come up in Engineered Fastening or on the periphery, that would be quite interesting to us. In oil and gas, the – I don’t think we’ll ever see oil and gas as a large percentage of the company. But there are some assets in oil and gas that might be attractive, especially to the extent that they enable us to diversify using some of the technologies that we are in today to diversify outside to – into process industries and maybe repair and service for some of the infrastructure in oil and gas and related areas. So that could be interesting. I think other theme that you’ll see over time is, as we develop that flexible technology, it’s going to become obvious that there’s some acquisitions that enable us to really as we go up the power curve to exploit that technology to its fullest potential So those are all things that we think about and we’ll see. We have a pretty ambitious growth goal here to double the size of the company by 2022. And we’re going to need something on the order of $5 plus-billion worth of acquisitions supplement to the organic growth to get there. And so I think you’ll see not, not anything in the near-term, because we’re in the process of digesting what we’ve already done here. But as we get into 2018, 2019, and so on, you’re liable to see something in one of those areas that I just touched upon or more.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Jason Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and nice quarter.
James Loree: Thank you. Good morning.
Michael Jason Rehaut: My question is around Newell. I believe, you laid out in the presentation $0.20 to $0.25 of accretion in 2017 and that’s assuming the first quarter closing, I’m sorry, yes, first quarter closing. And I believe that’s better than your initial guidance of $0.15 for the full first year. So I was wondering if you could talk about what was driving that, if I have those numbers right? And also if I could sneak in a clarification on how Mac Tools did growth wise during the quarter? Thanks.
James Loree: Sure. So, yes, there’s a change in the Newell Tools estimate. It really has to do with the financing-related activities primarily. And we – in the initial estimates, we had assumed some longer-term debt that we would put in place, short-term debt as well. But given some of the things that have occurred and how strong our free cash flow performance was exiting the year and our view on cash flow for 2017, we don’t see the need for the long-term financing right now. And therefore, the interest costs related to that transaction will be dramatically lower, not only in 2017, but on an ongoing basis. So it really kind of jumpstarts the accretion in year one and gives us an extra $0.05 to $0.10 related to that particular item. As far as Mac Tools goes, they had a solid quarter with mid single-digit organic growth, and was pretty much in line with our expectation.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O’Callaghan from UBS. Your line is open.
Shannon O’Callaghan: Good morning, guys.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Shannon O’Callaghan: Hey, just on the industrial business, obviously, a lot of – on the top line a lot of moving parts there going into next year with, I guess, still a little bit of electronics drag, curious when that kind of finally ends. And then what are you assuming, I guess, in the plan for Dakota, given – how much of a drag have you baked in, and does it assuming it comes back at all? And then maybe just comment on the fourth quarter margins there – were down pretty sharply year-over-year? Thanks.
James Loree: Yes. So the – I would say, if you start with the Electronics business and Engineered Fastening, yes, we’re probably going to see, it’s about a $20 million drag here in 2017 on revenue from that business and specific that customer that we referred to get down to a number on an annual basis around $50 million, maybe $45 million in that kind of range. So, as Jim mentioned, it’s becoming a much smaller component of that business on a go-forward basis, which from our perspective is a good thing. The other thing I would say a little bit and the other topic, your question you had on oil and gas in Dakota, we’re pretty much done. We don’t have any really any new revenue opportunity associated with that. We were part of the pipeline constructed leading up to what occurred over this summer and to the fall. And so there’s really not a lot of new revenue opportunity for us on that particular pipeline. And then you meant, you also had a question of profitability of the overall segment. It was really impacted by what I touched on, which was clearly there’s a deleveraging effect of the top line impacted, just we’re not able to take enough actions to offset that impact and that’s really the main driver of it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Your line is open.
Jeremie Capron: Thanks and good morning, all.
James Loree: Good morning, Jeremie.
Jeremie Capron: I wanted to ask about your import situation in the U.S., we talked about that on the call following the announcement of the Newell acquisition that gives you a little more leeway there probably to shift some production into the U.S., but as we try to quantify your net importer situation into the U.S., can you help us understand what it amounts to today? Thank you.
James Loree: Yes we import a lot into the United States, there is no question about that. That’s pretty much the standard model in the tool industry, which is an important model into developing countries for the most part. Now, we have differentiated ourselves over the past few years by ramping up our U.S. presence much more aggressively than our competition has. And so today we have 3,000 employees manufacturing tools in the United States and 11 plants and we’ve always had a fairly significant manufacturing infrastructure in the U.S. selling into the U.S., but it is getting bigger and it’s going to get even bigger because whether or not any of those proposed concepts are implemented or not, it’s making more sense to have that U.S. presence because in the market the folks that are buying the tools, the end-users really like those tools that are made in the United States for US tradesmen and so on. So you’ll see a continued growth in our U.S. manufacturing base with the Craftsman deal, we’re going to open up a new plant in the United States location to be determined, it’s going to be very highly technologically equipped so that it can produce the highest quality tools at the best cost in the world, and we’re excited about that, it will become a showcase plan and when you look at the competition in the industry they are all going to play catch up. There is one other company, I mentioned this on the Craftsman call that is a competitor of ours, but not in the core of our business, but in the auto mechanics and industrial business, they compete with us. They also have a great U.S. manufacturing infrastructure. The rest of them are going to be playing catch up.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo, your line is open.
Rich M. Kwas: Hi good morning.
James Loree: Good morning.
Rich M. Kwas: Two quick questions. Jim strategic, kind of follow-up to Jeff’s question as you think about M&A, a lot on your plate here, as we think about 2017 and 2018 what are the chances that we see kind of smaller bolt ons added as we get later in the year and early 2018, how would you couch that and then Don, question on productivity in terms of the savings from restructuring that have been done over the last couple of years are those included in that $0.45, $0.50 of savings for this year and then the other quick question is buyback, what’s – the 1.51 is a little higher than you are looking for, I assume there is some incremental buy back that could occur over the course of this year, but any additional thoughts there? Thanks.
James Loree: Well let Don start with the two questions that you gave him and then I’ll hit the acquisition question.
Donald Allan: Yes, we will start with the cost actions and productivity. And as I had mentioned in my comments, we have had about $50 million of restructuring charges per year for almost last three years now, and so yes there certainly is, when you look at the $0.55 and $0.60 of positive accretion from cost actions and productivity there is a carryover effect to that. I would say it’s probably 10%, maybe of that number, 15% in that range, it’s not a large part of it, but I would remind everybody that we have been very proactive in our cost reduction programs for quite some time and in particular over the last two years as we dealt with all this currency pressure, and Jim mentioned the number close to 400 million over the last two years. We certainly got some price benefits, offset to that, but it was only about a third of how much we are able to offset. So, we had two thirds of all that that we had to find a way to more than offset to grow our earnings and a lot of those where through cost actions that we’ve done either through continued productivity actions in our supply chain and getting productivity levels up to 5%, 6% in some cases depending on the business and then just ongoing SG&A what I would call healthy restructuring that occurs. And then this year, we’re going to continue that activity like we have been doing because we’ve got nice momentum. We’ve also got functional transformation occurring that will begin to reap some benefit benefits of that here in 2017, something we started talking about almost 2 years ago now. And so that is a positive, so, and the $50 million of restructuring that we’re going to utilize in 2017 will help drive some of those benefits as well. So, I think we’ve positioned ourselves well over the next three years to be focused on balancing where we take cost out and then where we also implement cost to make investments to stimulate more growth and that’s really what you’re seeing here. On the second question related to shares outstanding, we have not assumed any type of buyback in our number at this point. The increase reflects the impact of the hybrid that matured in the fourth quarter of 2016 about 3 million of share impact year-over-year. We will see how the year progresses, as far as cash flow, but at this point we think our cash is pretty much focused on paying for the M&A activity and we don’t have a lot of excess cash to focus on share repurchase, but if we do a little better than we expect there is certainly an opportunity for us to do that.
James Loree: Okay and then as it relates to bolt-ons, as Don said there isn’t all lot of cash to start with left after the – capacity left after the deals that we’ve announced, but I would say if we were to see some bolt-ons – smaller ones as you point out aggregating no more than 100 to 200, you know that might be a possibility that would be played against the buybacks so that’s kind of where we are. We think our our culture as bold and agile, but yet thoughtful and disciplined and I think we’ve demonstrated the bold and the agile part and the thoughtful part and the discipline part as it relates to the negotiation of these transactions and the deal execution and now we need to demonstrate that as it relates to the integration part of it. So, it will not make a whole lot of sense to do anything in addition to what we’ve done this year in a large scale, and we’ll get the integration is right, we’ll get the Newell Tools safely assimilated into our company, and providing the accretion we will get Craftsman get that growth trajectory going that we’ve committed to, and then in 2018, and thereabouts 2019 whatever the right time is we will be back with something bigger in all likelihood.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley, your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks good morning guys. First of all, I want to say congratulations on getting the $0.10 that there aren’t too many manufacturers at that kind of level, so really well done there.
James Loree: Thank you.
Nigel Coe: So, I guess I’m asking this question on FlexVolt, sounds like from your guidance you gave on, we are on track for $100 million of incremental sell-in in 2017, can you maybe just mark us on what you achieved in 2016, and then maybe some commentary around where we are on the launch geographically and by products, and any early reads on how the launch is impacting the potential conversation of quarter products and pricing commentary would be helpful as well?
James Loree: Yes Nigel it is Jim. I’ll take the bigger picture part of that and if Don wants to supplement it with some commentary that would be fine. The flexible initiative, so as you pointed out sold a $100 million in four months and a lot of that was selling, but there was a fair amount of sell-out to, and it’s been extremely well received by the end user community and this is all about speed to establishing an install base as it relates to the competition because the tools, the batteries are backwards compatible in the DEWALT tools, so it’s complementary to our installed base. And where we are really trying to attack is at the competitors install base. And so think of FlexVolt as a battery system that is establishing an install base as aggressively and quickly as possible that requires DEWALT tools to operate and then think of every year a wave of new tools skews coming in that will enhance the substitution of coated products and the ability for us to substitute coated products in the higher voltage, higher power requirements, higher duty cycle type skews. And if you think of it that way, I think it’s helpful because then you will understand it really is, well there is going to be some cannibalization of our own coated tools, it really is a market share gain mechanism that has enormous potential event at the voltage levels we are at today. And we haven’t even talked about going up the voltage curve or the power curve, which we have the capability to do as we develop this technology. And that breakthrough innovation that we’re working on will have some more surprises I’m sure, positive surprises in the future. Don?
Donald Allan: Yes, I would just add that related to 2017 your comment is correct Nigel, we do see another $100 million of incremental revenue that is included in our guidance. Jim however did discuss in his comments that we have capacity up to $400 million. So, in total we have $200 million in our numbers with incremental of a $100 million next year so there’s capacity to take on another $200 million. The $100 million makes sense to us right now based on it’s too early to really know what the cannibalization is going to be. And that’s something we’ll watch closely, but if the cannibalization is not as high then there’s certainly a possibility that we’re somewhere between that $200 million to $400 million number as the year progresses combined with some of the factors that that Jim just mentioned.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Robert Barry: Hey, guys good morning.
James Loree: Good morning.
Robert Barry: So, I wanted to begin to the tools growth and the outlook, it feels like the growth outlook keeps creeping down a little bit. I think at 3Q it was a little below seven and a conference in December five to six that’s now mid-single, which feels like five to me. So, I’m curious what’s driving that, what sounds like incremental caution. And maybe it helps to comment on 4Q and just clarify, if you sold a $100 million of FlexVolt in four months, I’m assuming three quarters of that would be in a 4Q that’s about four points of growth there. I think right I mean doesn’t seem like it leaves a whole lot of room for organic ex-FlexVolt on what was a fairly easy comp, so maybe some color there on the growth outlook in tools. Thanks.
Donald Allan: Yes, I’ll give you some color on the outlook, remember back in October earnings call, I gave a framework for 2017, which was total growth of 4% for the company. And I gave a little color by segment with, I indicated tools of mid-single digit. So that would be whatever you want to be somewhere between 4% and 6% that’s really what we’ve been seeing for the last 100 plus days. And so I don’t – not sure what you’re referring to specifically other than the 7% was our performance in 2016. And so that’s certainly, maybe there is a an aspect of that that I’m just clarifying, but we feel pretty good about that and our view going into the year that’s the right place to be at this stage. As far as FlexVolt, yes we had about $50 million, $60 million of FlexVolt in the fourth quarter. And as Jim said part of that was booked the continued loading, but part of it was also sell-through. And so there’s the combination of factors there so that certainly contributed to the 7.3% organic growth that we saw in the fourth quarter, but there’s still a very strong underlying growth excluding that as well that’s been driven by all the other activities that I mentioned in my comments related to Tools & Storage segment.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joe Ritchie: Thanks, good morning guys.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Joe Ritchie: So meaning to sign a parse out 1Q a little bit more yes it’s helpful to get the buckets. But can you quantify the year-over-year impact from higher restructuring in FX in 1Q. And then secondly if you realize commodities are going to be a headwind for a lot of industrial companies in 2017, but maybe talk a little bit about what type of pricing you think you can get as well as we progress through the year?
Donald Allan: Yes. So Q1 I would fear for your modeling purposes for restructuring I would say, I would use about half of the $50 million in Q1. So, we expect to move a fair amount of activity to get really to help drive some of the benefits that I talked about in guidance of the cost reduction and productivity action. So that’s certainly is a large number that impacts the EPS in Q1 and why it’s a lower percentage for the full-year. I would exclude that and kind of look at the underlying performance without that effect that’s more just based on decisions they we’re making and not operationally focused. The other thing is on a currency it’s very close to $20 million incremental impact in Q1 and so those two items combined with a little bit of pressure from the shares, higher share count in the first quarter is why you’re seeing that type of EPS number for Q1. And pricing actions, we are always looking for surgical pricing actions. We’ve been doing that for over a decade now in our company. It take in our Tools & Storage business that team is very much focused on what they can do at a very specific level or at the product level or product family level depending on the situation and we make decisions on what the right pricing decisions are that are both price increases in some cases on occasion price decreases that might be necessary for certain products. But overall, looking how they get a price increase. Commodity inflation certainly offers up an opportunity to talk about price increases, but the reality is $50 million to our whole company in a full-year is really not large enough at this point to make a large case for a broad price increase. But it certainly is something that we utilize and we go through and do the surgical analysis of pricing by product to help make the decision of what is the right price point for a specific product.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David MacGregor: Yes, good morning and congressional on a good progress.
James Loree: Thank you.
David MacGregor: The question is on Craftsman. And I wondered if you could just talk about the white space opportunity, and any reference you can make to sizing would be helpful? And also, how much control do you have over what Sears does with the brand with respect to pricing promotion?
James Loree: We have zero control over what Sears does with respect to pretty much anything. And that’s part of the rationale for why we think this is a deal that is pro-competitive and should be able to pass through the competitive review. So as far as the growth trajectory, we start off with $100 million or thereabouts of business that we actually acquire as part of the transaction and then the rest is up to us. So there are – we have a tremendous commercial capability in this company that can span all the channels in the Tool business. And Craftsman is kind of a unique brand in the sense that it plays in the auto mechanics channel, the industrial channel, the professional tradesmen, the DIY type of user, it’s – the – one of the broadest brands in Tools. And so, our approach is going to be to partner up with our big box customer – partners and make sure that we exploit that channel. We are going to try to partner up with a large e-commerce company and make it available broadly through e-commerce. And we think that’s an exciting growth opportunity. It’s a – it’s one customer that I’m referring to will tell you that Craftsman power tools is the single biggest unfulfilled search that it has. And so, we’re excited about that. And then we have our automotive repair channel nut tools that we would expect to carry the Craftsman brand on in some form at some point. So lots of different approaches what we’ve committed to in the pro forma was $100 million a year of growth. So over a ten-year period, getting to pretty much a straight line – on a straight line basis getting to a $1 billion over that period and we hope that we can do better than that. But we think that’s a very, very doable development curve.
Donald Allan: I would just enhance Jim’s comment on what control we have, we did, is right, we have zero control. But they do need to meet certain quality standards for use of the brand. And so that is part of the band license, so it’s not to say control, but it is a standard that we wanted to have in place to ensure the quality of the products are at the right level.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning, guys.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Just to pull the thread on FlexVolt a little bit more, I think you’ve spoken many times about, getting over the curve in terms of factory utilization. And when should we think about the bridge to that being accretive to the total Tools margins versus, I would pursue still just based on the way you’ve laid out the cadence for EPS probably still dilutive in the first-half of the year?
James Loree: Yes, it is. I mean, so based on our – what’s in our guidance that would be dilutive in the first-half, gets –in the back-half still probably marginally dilutive based on the current forecast. Now, if we start getting levels above $200 million, and we’re approaching $400 million, that’s going to change the margin picture dramatically. So that that’s a factor that we have not assumed in our guidance. So it’s a bit of a double positive that we get the extra revenue impact that we’d also get the leverage impact of somewhere – going somewhere between $200 million to $400 million in revenue.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: And I guess related to that, what is the expectation for sell-in versus sell-through in that incremental $100 million this year?
James Loree: Well, the vast majority of it, we would expect it to be probably sell-through and – but we’ll see as the year progress. We certainly have a little bit of a load in happening here in the first quarter. But where is the stage now, where we’re restocking and we would hope that that a lot of that would be sell-through.
Donald Allan: Yes, the skews will be sell-in and some...
James Loree: That’s a good point later in the year.
Donald Allan: But our new skews would be sell-in.
James Loree: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Your line is open.
Liam Burke: Thank you. Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Don.
James Loree: Good morning.
Donald Allan: Good morning.
Liam Burke: Jim, you highlighted that in the hand Tools & Storage business, the industrial had a good quarter. You – in the Q&A, you discussed that Mac Tools was up single digits, mid single digits. Mac Tools though has been strong for the last several quarters. Is there anything else industrial that perform particularly well?
James Loree: Well, the industrial business itself showed – within Tools showed signs of life, really had a positive quarter in a long, long time, two years. So I think that that goes under the Proto and the FACOM brands. They did quite well. And so it does look like we potentially have hit an inflection point with the – with that kind of MRO type markets.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So I’d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Waybright for closing remarks.

Operator: Welcome to the Q3 2016 Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Nicole and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.
Greg Waybright - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third quarter 2016 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself is Jim Loree, our President and CEO, and Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our Press Release. This morning, Jim and Don will review our third quarter 2016 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. And consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our Press Release and in our most recent 1934 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim?
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. In the third quarter, we continued to perform at a high level delivering modestly above market organic growth. We also achieved another quarter of margin expansion, despite a challenging external backdrop, which included slow global growth, dollar strength, and geopolitical and other volatility. In a few minutes, Don will provide color on each business segment but first here's a few highlights. Total company organic growth was 3% in the quarter and revenues were up 2% net of currency. Tools & Storage led the way, up 5%, with the European team contributing a remarkable second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth up 11%. The securities segment continued to make good progress, up 2% organically with all regions contributing. The North American business delivered a point of organic growth to go along with noteworthy year-to-date margin improvement. Industrial was weighed down by the impact of one major electronics customer, and to a lesser extent, by general industrial market conditions. As a result, the segment continued to experience top-line contraction, in this case 4%. On a very positive note, total company operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year to 15.2%, as a strong operating performance more than offset the impact of currency headwinds and the cost impact of growth investments. Diluted EPS was $1.68, up 8% year-over-year on continued revenue growth with solid operating leverage driven by disciplined price management and cost control, productivity gains, and commodity deflation, among other factors. The third quarter also marked the beginning of the exciting launch of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, the first breakthrough innovation coming out of SFS2.0. This introduction has been met with unbridled enthusiasm across our professional customer base. The magnitude of the technological accomplishment in conjunction with the sheer breadth and depth of the marketing campaign has driven strong early momentum. We expect the success of this initiative to continue into the fourth quarter through 2017 and for years to come. In fact, the early returns suggest that this will be the largest and most successful power tool product rollout in our company's history. This success will likely enable us to continue our strong Tools & Storage organic growth track record into 2017, despite having to overcome comps from 2014, 2015, and 2016 averaging 7% annually. And finally, I'm pleased to note that we have raised the midpoint of our full year 2016 EPS guidance by $0.05 from $6.40 to $6.45, and tightened the full year EPS range to $6.40 to $6.50. It was previously $6.30 to $6.50. Don will cover this increase in the midpoint in more detail during his remarks. Moving over to M&A, as many of you know, on October 12 we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase the Newell Tools business, including the Irwin and Lenox brands from Newell Brands Incorporated. I would like to spend a few minutes sharing some thoughts on this transaction. I'll start by saying that we are very excited by the growth and margin expansion opportunities this deal brings. In addition to clearly identified and achievable cost synergies, there is tremendous strategic value here. We see significant opportunities for revenue synergies in both the short-term and the long-term. Opportunities include channel optimization, cross branding of product lines, and geographic expansion. These opportunities are very similar on a somewhat smaller scale to the ones we were so successful in pursuing with regard to Black & Decker, a gift which keeps on giving. And we're fortunate to have the same Tools senior leadership team in place that integrated Black & Decker, and that team is now focused on the Newell business. We also really like the assets. The Lenox and Irwin brands are among the best in their respective categories and are attractive and powerful additions to our portfolio. The product offerings are highly complementary to our existing Tools product line and significantly increased the size of our hand tools and power tools, accessories businesses. Newell Tools also extends our channel presence in the plumbing and electrical trades, which are both attractive adjacencies to our legacy core markets. You can see a breakdown of revenues by region and product mix as well as by brand on the right hand side of the page and this transaction brings top tier positions globally in both the Band Saw Blade and Linear Edge markets where the Lenox brand reigned supreme while also meaningfully bolstering our pliers and accessories product lines, among others. And as we noted on the deal announcement call, this transaction marks the end of our nearly three-year self-imposed M&A moratorium. And over that time, we significantly strengthened the foundation of our core businesses, implemented a new enhanced operating system, SFS2.0, drove gains in organic growth and margin expansion while advancing our incremental and breakthrough innovation processes, all of which position the company for strong performance over the last few years and into the future. And I'm pleased that our first acquisition after this break is a business that lines up so well with our strategic growth framework and our core competencies. In line with that framework in our financial criteria, we expect EPS to be accretive year one, delivering $0.15 a share and growing to at least $0.50 a share in year three, both on an ex-charges basis. The transition and integration planning is now under way with closing expected sometime in 2017, most likely in the first half. And at this point, I'll turn it over to Don Allan who will cover more detail on segment performance, as well as provide a financial update. Don?
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We'll now take a more in-depth look at our third quarter performance across the segment. As previously mentioned by Jim, the Tools & Storage business delivered another outstanding quarter of organic growth of 5% as we saw continued significant share gains in Europe, which was up 11%, and a solid performance in North America, which grew at 4%. The emerging markets were up modestly in the quarter as declines in the Middle East and Northern Africa offset mid to high single-digit growth in Latin America and Asia. Over the last few quarters, we have been adding commercial and leadership resources to the Middle East and North Africa teams and expect that business to swing back to a positive organic growth trajectory in the coming year. In North America, share gains were driven by U.S. retail, up high-single digits, despite inventory reductions by certain retail partners and we had a very strong performance in Canada, also up high-single digits. In the aggregate, this strong performance more than offset persistent weakness in the North American industrial tool channel. Within our U.S. retail channels, POS remained healthy and excitement around the FLEXVOLT launch met lofty expectations, leaving the product line on track to deliver on our 2016 revenue expectations. We have talked quite a bit over the last few quarters about how an incredible technological accomplishment the Tools team has been able to deliver with this new product platform. Developing FLEXVOLT from scratch through our breakthrough innovation process and driving it from concept to store shelves in just under two years. But I also want to highlight how proud we are of the commercial team's effort in coordinating this rollout, which was the first and largest global product launch in our company's 170 plus year history. The excitement and enthusiasm that they have been able to generate globally, while no doubt aided by the unparalleled technological accomplishment of this product has nonetheless been simply extraordinary. This launch also serves as a perfect example of how the digital and commercial excellent pillars of SFS2.0 combined with an enhanced breakthrough and incremental innovation process compounding our engineering achievements through superior marketing, targeting commercial efforts, and paving the way for significant organic growth opportunities. The European team continued their commercialization efforts throughout the region to drive tremendous share gains once again. When you consider the third quarter's impressive 11% organic growth against the backdrop of a 14% gain in the second quarter, and high-single digit organic growth in 2014 and 2015, the magnitude of this achievement comes into focus and is truly extraordinary. Gains continue to be widespread throughout the region within the UK, France and Central Europe, all delivering strong performances from new product development, growth investments, and an ever increasing retail footprint. Turning to the SBUs. Power tools were up 8% on the back of the FLEXVOLT launch and commercial successes that I just discussed. While the Hand Tools & Storage business declined by 3%, as pressure in the Industrial Tool channels more than offset growth in Mac Tools and strong performances in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. From a profitability perspective, the Tools business continues to impress, expanding its operating margin 70 basis points in the quarter and delivering $330 million of operating profit. These results were achieved despite continued currency pressure and while balancing growth-related investments, a clear demonstration of our ability to drive operating leverage as we grow. And I'll just make one final comment in the Tools & Storage business. When you think about the results the team delivered over the last few years in this challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, you can understand more clearly why we are so excited about the Newell Tools acquisition. There is a significant value creation opportunity presented by folding these powerful brands and high quality products into our best-in-class Tools & Storage operation. Moving on to Security, the segment delivered its third consecutive quarter of organic growth, up 2% with all regions contributing. As Jim mentioned, North America posted its first quarter of growth since Q2 of 2015, led by higher volume within the commercial, electronics security and automatic door businesses. It is very encouraging to see the North American team combine the field productivity and profitability improvements they have made over the last two years with budding organic growth as the business continues to progress forward. In Europe, the team continued its organic growth trend, up close to 1.5% in the quarter, making this the eighth consecutive quarter of organic growth. Higher installation volumes and a strong performance in the Nordics and Germany helped to drive top-line growth and offset the pressures that we've seen in the UK, where we are continuing to see some negative impact on CapEx spend and commercial decisions relating to Brexit. We also saw organic growth from Security's emerging markets operation, a positive sign for this relatively small portion of the segment. Margins in the Security segment continued to improve, up 180 basis points in the quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by the North American team's continued success with its field efficiency and productivity efforts as well as continued focus on tight controls over SG&A across the entire segment. Margins were also favorably influenced by more intense rigor over the profitability requirements of our commercial opportunities that we implemented in the past year, the benefits of which are now beginning to see within our operating margin rate as backlog orders are converting to revenue. Let's move to the Industrial segment. Revenues were down in the quarter, as anticipated, as the impact of one large electronics customer and still weak industrial market conditions adversely impacted Engineered Fastening volume. This decline more than offset the mid-single digit growth in Infrastructure resulting in an overall 4% organic decline for the segment. Within Engineered Fastening, the organic revenue decline was largely expected; however, the global automotive business continued to perform well with solid growth in Europe and Asia, which outpaced light vehicle production. This growth more than offset some slowness that we've experienced in the North American automotive business in Q3. The impact associated with the volume declines tied to one large electronics customer had a significant impact on Engineered Fastening, as well as the overall segment's organic growth for the quarter. If you exclude this impact, Engineered Fastenings' organic growth would have been slightly positive and the Industrial segment's organic growth would have been 1% for the quarter. Infrastructure posted organic growth of 5%, driven by higher Oil & Gas and onshore project activity, which more than offset continued weakness in the Hydraulic Tools business; however, that's beginning to show some signs of stabilizing. Finally, while profitability in the Industrial segment declined by 40 basis points year-over-year, the segment still managed to achieve a very healthy 17.4% OM rate as a result of significant productivity gains and cost control actions, which managed to largely offset the negative margin impact from the top line decline. So let's move to slide 7 and talk about our free cash flow, which came in at $169 million for the third quarter in line with our prior year performance. The year-over-year improvement in net income of $21 million was offset by a slightly larger expansion in working capital and a higher CapEx investment of $10 million each. However, and very importantly, working capital turns in the quarter improved by 0.7 turns to 7.1 times, as the slight increase in working capital dollars covered a greater year-over-year revenue base. Year-to-date free cash flow performance remains very strong, coming in at $428 million through the third quarter as higher earnings combined with significantly lower expansion in working capital of approximately $200 million have absorbed $42 million of additional CapEx investments to deliver a solid $254 million outperformance versus the prior year. The working capital discipline has been particularly impressive, given the strong organic growth we have seen throughout 2016, not to mention the inventory builds related to the FLEXVOLT launch, which commenced in Q3. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at approximately 100% conversion rate. As in the past, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in the fourth quarter on the back of solid earnings growth and the seasonal working capital liquidation we experienced within our Tools & Storage business. So let's shift to guidance on slide 8. As Jim noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising the midpoint of our EPS guidance and tightening the range $6.40 to $6.50, from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.50. The revised range represents an 8% to 10% year-over-year increase in earnings per share. This raises our third in as many quarters for 2016 and is representative of the continued strong performance by Tools & Storage and solid improvement in our Security segment profitability profile. These outperformances have more than offset a difficult performance in our Industrial segment. As you can see on the left side of the chart, the $0.05 increase in the midpoint of our guidance is driven by improved operating performance, primarily within Tools & Storage. These improvements relate to continued indirect cost controls and slightly higher levels of cost productivity than originally estimated. Please note that this guidance does exclude any potential acquisition costs which could occur in the fourth quarter related to the Newell Tools deal. Let's shift to the segment outlook on the page. Tools & Storage is still expected to generate high-single digit growth for the full year as we see continued share gains across the globe combined with the FLEXVOLT launch in the second half of 2016. We are still estimating the revenue impact of FLEXVOLT to be slightly under $100 million in 2016. Security is expected to grow low-single digits, as momentum in North America and emerging markets offset some modest pressure we are seeing in Europe, related primarily to Brexit dynamics within the UK which is impacting certain large financial customers. Finally, we now expect the mid-single digit full year decline in Industrial revenue as our Engineered Fastening business continues to work through the lost revenue from the previously mentioned major electronics customer, which, by the way, will anniversary in Q4, and additionally may experience market-driven headwinds within the general Industrial business. Another set of factors to be aware of in Industrial is that we expect the North American automotive business to reflect the slowing market as we end 2016, combined with a weak Oil & Gas pipeline construction market in Q4. Turning to operating margin rates, all segments remain in line with previous expectations as Tools & Storage and Security's profitability improves year-over-year and the Industrial segment declines, driven by top-line contraction. Our operating performance in 2016 has been strong with EPS growth expected to be 8% to 10%, despite absorbing another year of significant currency headwinds, which totaled $150 million or approximately $0.75 of earnings per share. We are very pleased with the team's performance to-date and now are squarely focused on wrapping up a great year highlighted by a strong performance on both organic revenue and earnings growth. In summary, the third quarter was another solid performance for the company as organic growth finished up 3% and earnings per share up 8% versus the prior year. Tools & Storage delivered another outstanding performance, likewise the Security segment continues to progress, driving both organic growth and margin rate expansion. Based on this quarter's performance or outperformance, that is, we are raising the midpoint of and tightening the EPS guidance range to $6.40 up to $6.50 from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.50. The third quarter marked the anxiously awaited launch of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which was met with tremendous excitement from professionals, tradesmen, and tool enthusiasts around the world, our first of what we believe will be many successful breakthrough innovations in the future. On October 12, we ended our nearly three-year self-imposed VD (20:40) moratorium with the announcement of our agreement to acquire the Newell Tools business, including the iconic Lenox and solid Irwin brands, a highly strategic and financially attractive transaction. Lastly, we are continuing with our review of the Security business. As we have previously noted, we expect to provide an update at some point during the fourth quarter reporting period. There are a number of exciting things happening at Stanley Black & Decker today. The opportunities presented by the FLEXVOLT launch and Newell Tools transaction are significant and robust. As we look ahead into 2017, we remain committed to delivering solid organic growth and EPS operating leverage consistent with our three-year annual financial objectives previously communicated. That concludes the presentation portion of today's call. Now, let's move to Q&A.
Greg Waybright - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Don. Nicole, if you could, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Greg Waybright - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Morning.
Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Going to squeeze in a couple here but just one for Jim, one for Don. Jim, in terms of future M&A, obviously the Newell deal announced and we're going to get some kind of resolution with Security here relatively soon. What's the appetite to do further M&A as you go deeper into 2017 and is this more of a function, a barometer around ability to execute versus opportunities out there? And then, for Don, as we think about 2017 in terms of margin expansion and how you're thinking about that preliminarily, what are the puts and takes? You've had a pretty good year here in 2016 and would seem like with commodity prices moving up a bit that maybe some more headwinds as we think about 2017? Thanks.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Okay. Well, I'll start. This is Jim. As far as M&A goes, we're – historically, if we go back 15 years or so, and we look at the capital allocation of the company, we've taken almost exactly 50% of our excess capital and allocated it to M&A, and the other 50% we've given back to the shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. And during that timeframe, we more than quintupled the size of the company and gave back a lot of cash along the way, and returns to shareholders were very, very solid, 400%, 500% over that timeframe. So we like that formula, and when we took the break it really was an opportunity to digest many of the acquisitions that we did over that timeframe. And now, we're back and we intend to kind of continue with that 50% allocation of excess capital to M&A and it's not an organizational bandwidth issue. I think Newell, despite it's relatively significant size, is really a bolt-on acquisition for the tool business. So, I'm not underestimating the importance of getting that integration right at all. It's top priority for us, but there are other businesses in the portfolio, and there's also some other activity going on in the tool industry that might lead to further consolidation, which we would intend to be a part of. So we'll do more deals as we go forward and it will be a contributor to our growth. We expect our organic growth to be 4% to 6% over the long-term, and we expect acquisitions to contribute another 5%, 6% annually above that.
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah. And I'll address your second question, Rich, which is about kind of our views of 2017. Maybe what I can do is, build upon my comments at the end of the presentation and give a little bit of a framework of our current thoughts related to 2017. As I presented back in our Investor Day in May of 2015, we gave kind of a three-year perspective, annual objectives for three years is basically what it was and we said organic growth had a profile of 4% to 6%. Organic EPS growth would be 6% to 8%, so really demonstrating that operating leverage. And then, obviously acquisitions, we presented something in excess of 10% EPS growth if you included acquisitions. Our thoughts right now is that we think we're in that range. We're probably on the organic growth side at the low end of the range, which should be similar to the profile that we've experienced here in 2016, around 4%. We think that's probably a good proxy at this stage for next year. And then, the EPS number is probably in that – around that midpoint of that range I just mentioned at this stage. The other thing to keep in mind is as you start to look at the different segments for organic growth in particular, our Tools business will probably grow about 7% this year by the time the year is done. Our Security business will be around 1% organic growth, and we'll see mid-single digit declines in Industrial. Keeping in mind Industrial does have that kind of difficult comp that it's been dealing with a major customer. If you exclude that impact, it's probably down about 2% today. I think that's a good framework, frankly, for next year with maybe Tools being a little bit lower from that 7%, but we'll see how positive the impact of FLEXVOLT is. It's still early days, but as Jim mentioned, it's very positive at this stage, so we'll see if that is a little bit higher than our expectation. We previously communicated that we think it will be $200 million roughly of revenue next year. And the one factor we don't know yet is the cannibalization impact. And then, the other two segments, I think you'll see 1% to 2% growth probably in Security and a modest decline most likely Industrial continuing, as we probably work through continued difficult Industrial market. But I think that's a good framework to start with, and we'll see how the year ends. We haven't provided specific input around currency and commodities. But at this point, based on current rates, currency is probably a $20 million to $30 million pressure next year, and commodities is probably a similar amount at this stage. So we don't see that as a major headwind going into 2017, which is why we still think we can achieve reasonable operating leverage.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you very much. Just a little bit more color on FLEXVOLT if you can or if you're willing. Just wondering if you've achieved full channel fill at this point? And anything else you could tell us about kind of promotional costs and how those could influence margins not only in the fourth quarter but maybe into the early part of next year as you continue to push forward?
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah, this is Jim. The channel fill has been fairly comprehensive. It's still in process. So it continues, but it's on track. And as Don said, we'll be in the $100 million range for the four months, September through December, which meets our expectations. And I'd say there's probably more customer demand growing as we fill the channel and they start to see the early signs of their end-user pull. And so, we're expecting a pretty good growth as we go into 2017, as Don mentioned. And as far as the margin elements, I'll have – Don, you can tackle that one.
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah. So as we initially discussed, I think back in July, the second half definitely has a little bit of margin pressure related to the launch of FLEXVOLT, both on the gross margin side and then some of the activities we're doing in SG&A around the digital marketing programs and commercialization activities. That's going to continue most likely into the first quarter. We don't see that as a major pressure point. As you see the business had 17.4% margin in the third quarter, very strong and up 70 basis points year-over-year. And so, we don't see it as a major drag, but it's certainly-- when you look at it sequentially versus Q2, as an example, it's one of reasons why we're at 17.4% versus 18.8% in the second quarter. But as we enter the back half of next year, margins will regulate and we get to more line averages or above, depending on which FLEXVOLT product category.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning, Gents.
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hi, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, so, Don, great color on 2017, and I'm just wondering if you're factoring anything into your sort of 2017 EPS, sort of math regarding any potential dilution from a potential Security portfolio decision. And then just a calculation on that, that would be great. And then on the Industrial – lots of moving parts there. Oil & Gas you've alluded that that starts to weaken in 4Q. Hydraulics you said is stabilizing, and your Apple is forecasting growth in 4Q. So, I'm just wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit of a roadmap on how you see the moving parts for Industrial tracking into 4Q and 2017?
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah, so let me start with thoughts about 2017 as it related to Security. In those comments that I made, we are not factoring in any decision related to Security because obviously there are different things that are being evaluated. However, if you look at the three options we discussed, one is obviously keeping the business, which would have no impact. The second option was to do something with the entire Security business, which would obviously have a significant impact to what I described. And then the third option was an evaluation of our mechanical lock business and determining potential divestiture of that. If that was the choice that we chose, then there would be, what I would say, a modest dilutive impact to that. However, the proceeds of the money we received could partially be used to do a buyback to minimize that dilution. So, our view is we don't think – under that scenario we don't think it would be – it would have a large impact on the numbers that I described. So that gives you a little bit of framework on our thoughts there. On the kind of the Industrial breakdown, you said Apple had growth in the fourth quarter. I think you were referring to Apple the company, not our business, but we're not projecting growth in our business, so that's probably part of your question. But what I said was that we are seeing – we saw slowing in the North American auto business in the third quarter. We expect that to continue as we're starting to see especially with the big four, a little lighter production schedule for the fourth quarter. So we're going to probably continue to see pressure there. The current projections for next year for light vehicle production are still positive, although they're very modest at just over about a 0.5% year-over-year. So, North America right now appears to be a modest growth number for light vehicle production, which we tend to outperform. We'll have to watch that very closely as the year ends. Looking at Oil & Gas, it is weakening and it's weakening primarily because there is a large project in the Dakotas of the U.S. that has been dealing with protesters and other activities that have shutdown a lot of that pipeline construction and that's impacted us modestly in Q3 but we do see that as a larger impact in Q4. And so, those are two factors that we're seeing in Q4 that are creating our view of guidance and why we have not raised our guidance beyond the $0.05 kind of drop through of what we outperformed, or a large part of what we outperformed in Q3.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron of CLSA. Your line is now open.
Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC: Thanks, good morning. Question on the Security business. I see you had a small acquisition here. Can you remind us what's going on exactly? I think you referred to buying some of the franchises in the Electronics Security business. So any color on that is appreciated. Thanks.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah, there's an element in growth in the Security business, which is supplementing our RMR portfolio, our recurring monthly revenue portfolio. And, so we will buy small bolt-on acquisitions, typically in the $20 million to $50 million kind of range. It's almost like CapEx. It's a bit of a steady state but it helps supplement the recurring revenue growth because, as you can imagine, when you have a recurring revenue portfolio and there's attrition in the 7% to 12% range, depending on the type of portfolio that you have to originate all that just to keep the recurring revenue portfolio even, and then you have to originate more to grow the recurring revenue portfolio. So growing the recurring revenue portfolio is assisted by supplementing it with small acquisitions but it's really not a very material amount of money to the overall corporation that we're spending on them.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Your line is now open.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning, guys.
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, Don, you talked a little bit about the FLEXVOLT being part of the sequential step down in margin this quarter, but as it applies to sequentially into 4Q what accounts for maybe a further step down in margin, and I mean you're launching FLEXVOLT around the holidays. It doesn't really seem like much of a holiday item, but how do I think about the kind of the 4Q sequential margin dynamics relative to what we just saw in 3Q?
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah. The fourth quarter normally has a sequential decline because there is a significant mix shift that does happen in Tools & Storage in Q4. Because of the holiday season, you do have a higher level of Black & Decker-branded products that are being solid, a little bit of promotional activities. And that historically has been, depending on the year, it can be anywhere from 40 basis points to 80 basis points of a drop when you look at Q3. If you factor in the FLEXVOLT activities, that most likely would be another 30 basis points to 50 basis points on top of that. So, the other thing that we're seeing is that we are seeing a little bit of modest commodity inflation as we exit the year. It's not dramatically impacting the rates, but that could be a 0.10 point as well with our 10 basis points. That kind of gives you a little bit of granularity around that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the lined line of Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks, good morning, and thanks for all the great detail, as always.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just wanted to dial into FLEXVOLT just a touch more. I know obviously it's very early on in the launch and that launch continues in 4Q, but I think earlier you said that you kind of referenced to the $200 million sales impact for next year without commenting on cannibalization. But as you're starting to see the orders at least coalesce at this point, I was just curious if you had any updated read on what the revenue impact would be in 3Q, 4Q, and if there's any upside. I think you said there was possibly some upside to the 200 next year. And also any sense potentially of that, any cannibalization?
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Okay, well, I'll let Don comment on quarterly revenue splits, but I don't think I'll say too much. But I'll talk about next year and the possibilities related to FLEXVOLT. And again, we don't know about cannibalization, so that is the big unknown. However, we feel like the order momentum is pretty good and the receptivity of the end users is excellent. So we are really paying attention to how much capacity do we have if this does become a much bigger program than $200 million in 2017. And right now we're hovering in the $400 million range for total capacity, and we're working to ensure that if it were even stronger than that that we could deal with the bottlenecks, but I don't imagine we could go too much beyond that. So, I think we're probably ring fencing it in the $200 million to $400 million sort of range.
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah. And as far as this year's third and fourth quarter, we don't really like grind into that detail, but as we said, it's a $100 million for this year, slightly under $100 million. I think you can reasonably assume that the split is pretty close to 50/50. It's not dramatically different than that. It's a little bit more in fourth quarter, a little less in third quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood of Macquarie. Your line is now open.
Michael Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: High, congratulations continuing to drive the outgrowth.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Thank you.
Michael Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I wanted to ask you on the 3% hand tool decline. Just some more color there on how much is explained by the declines in Industrial Tools, what the sequential trends have been there and when you're anniversarying that weakness. And is this primarily on the CRC-Evans business, I'm guessing? Just more data on the Mac Tools growth, as well. Thank you.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah. So when you look at our hand tool business for Tools & Storage, it's – as I mentioned, it's pressured. It was down 3% organically in the quarter. The pressure is coming from what we call the Industrial Tool business, which are the brands of Proto, Facom, our Storage business, which is under Vidmar and Lista, and then the Mac Tool business is in that category; however, they're serving primarily the automotive aftermarket and they continue to demonstrate kind of low to mid-single digit organic growth. And that's been a trend that they've been on for a while. So we're seeing pressure in those tool channels that's been since it started in probably the early part to the mid-part of fourth quarter of last year that pressure continues. It anniversaries, obviously, in the fourth quarter. We're not expecting to see growth in that profile in the fourth quarter, but certainly the amount of retraction should be much smaller. And hopefully we can move beyond that into next year and it doesn't become a pressure point. It's more of can it go beyond flat and how do we gain share and maybe demonstrate some modest growth in that space.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys, good morning.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: How should we think about the price cost spread given you're starting to plan for some inflation next year? Which, I guess, is really a question on being able to raise price here, since I think you indicated earlier that you're planning for, what, $20 million to $30 million of commodity inflation next year? Thanks.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Yeah. So this year we're going to show about a point of positive, and that was in a market that was primarily, a good part of the year was more of a deflation commodity situation, although the amount was not really significant, so we don't -- we were able to -- I get a lot of this price from two different areas. One, we certainly are getting a lot of price benefit to offset the currency pressure that you're seeing primarily in emerging markets. That was by taking those price actions. That's a big part of what that 1% is. And then there's what I would say the normal ongoing activity that we do in all our businesses and have been doing for quite some time, which is around what I typically call surgical or strategic pricing actions, which is really looking at different products, different product categories, looking at the competitive pricing dynamics, look at the value proposition and the differentiation we might have in these categories, and then really setting a pricing that we think is more appropriate for the value that we provide to the consumer or the customer. And we've been doing that, we continue to do that, and that's something that I think even in a modest commodity inflation environment next year -- and it will be modest. Remember, my comments were not – our expectations are that this is not something that's going to be a significant commodity inflation market. I just don't think the demand is there to really stimulate that type of activity. But that being said, these surgical marketing or pricing approaches are things that we will continue to do. And so, although we'll probably see a little bit of price pressure here and there on certain products because of what we experienced with commodities this year, having a modest inflationary environment actually is helpful when you're having some of these surgical price initiatives.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Hello?
Operator: Again, Joshua, your line is now open.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: I guess we answered his question. Just move on the call. Thanks.
Operator: No problem. Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke of Wunderlich. Your line is now open.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Don.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Jim, on the Newell acquisition, would you be picking up additional distribution or is there a lot of overlap in the channel?
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: There is definitely some incremental distribution that we're picking up, particularly in the plumbing and trades and electrical trades, and we really like that kind of distribution. It's very dependable kind of favorable type of both end market and end channel. So, that would be in the, kind of in the (44:47) channel and some of the other – those types of channels outside of the home centers and mass merchants. But then, there's a lot of overlap too. So it's kind of a nice balance. We pick up some incremental distribution, but we also have the ability to consolidate within our existing channels and gain synergies and so on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Saliq Khan of Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.
Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC: Hi, good morning, guys.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Morning.
Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC: Yeah, one quick question for you is: with your increasing presence within the emerging markets, what are you hearing right now from your distributors and the channel partners, both about the state of the economy over there? But also, what it is that you can do to improve the relations that you have with them to be able to better penetrate the market?
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Okay, well, I'll take that one. We have excellent, excellent coverage of the emerging markets. I think the Stanley Black & Decker merger positioned us to be able to really blanket the markets with distribution coverage. And in addition to that, we've organized in a way that enables us to both get intimate local market knowledge and coverage, and at the same time be able to introduce products and make marketing moves across the entire universe of the emerging markets. So an interesting walk around them, Latin America, which is pretty significantly over-indexed for us and has been pretty difficult over the last few years for reasons that relate mostly to political instability and also the commodity bust, and the impact that that had on those markets, and of course, the FX that came along with those problems, the currency pressures. But in any event, what we see in Latin America in general is some pretty positive indications. Nothing robust at this point of time, but I would – if I were betting, I would bet that the Latin American markets are going to be, in general, better in 2017 than they have been in recent years. In the sense that Argentina with Macri and some of his reforms are starting to take root, and then you have the long drawn out Brazilian political drama with the scandals and so forth that have unseated the leader. That all is going to, I think, ultimately result in more stability and more reforms as we go forward. And then some of the traditional, stronger – the ones that have been traditionally stronger in recent years, such as Mexico, will probably continue to chug along at the rate that they have been. Don't see any major dislocation there. And then, as commodities have stabilized, the Western countries in Latin America, like Chile and Peru, seemed to have stabilized as well. So, on balance, I think the Latin American situation is pretty bright for us as we go forward. If we move over to Asia, the non-Chinese developing markets in Asia, in general, are stable to slightly positive. China is a big question mark. We don't have a tremendous amount of volume in China, but the market itself is very questionable. I think right now it's hard to really believe the data that comes out related to GDP. And what we see is Industrial is very weak in China and we see no real reason to become bullish on Industrial in China. So it's quite negative. And sooner or later I think the chickens may come home to roost in terms of the reality in China, would be my guess. And then, we just take some of the other countries like Russia, that's pretty much a crapshoot in terms of what's going to happen there. Comps are very easy right now in terms of as we go forward. But then again, what does the future portend I think the political situation there is very questionable. And then, the same is true as you get into Turkey and some of the other Middle Eastern countries. And so, that's – in India, again, we don't have much in India, but India is a good place to be right now from an economic perspective. So hopefully that's helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. You're line is now open.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Morning.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: I guess, I wanted to ask you about Europe and the 11% organic growth, pretty impressive as you pointed out against the year ago compare. Can you just unpack what's going on there for us and help us understand some of the drivers behind that? And also, maybe just talk about the extent to which expanded distribution is growing that versus same-store sales?
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Sure. Excuse me, I'll take that one. As both Jim and I mentioned in our comments, we're very, very pleased with the organic growth profile that we've seen in Europe. And frankly, this is a trend that's been going on for almost three years now. We've seen really consistent anywhere from mid to high-single digit organic growth. This quarter was 11%, so even better, and low double digits. And, I think when we look at it, it started out as some revenue synergies that came out of the Stanley and Black & Decker merger that we really were leveraging and having a positive impact in that region. Then we started getting deeper into SFS2.0 and some of the commercial excellence efforts, now we're getting into the digital components of that with digital marketing and more E-commerce activities over there. And then, you combine it with the fact that with new technologies, like Brushless as an example in the cordless power tool space, innovation that we brought to the marketplace, we've created an opportunity to fill a lot of white space within certain base of our customers. And so, we've been able to fill that white space and put forth different products. Now, the other item that I did mention was also putting the Stanley FATMAX brand on mid-price point power tools in Europe. And so, that was another opportunity that was leveraging the effect of synergies of the two companies. And Europe is probably the best example, and then maybe emerging markets after that, of a combination of the revenue synergies from the merger and then the great benefits that we're starting to see in the first couple of years from SFS2.0.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: And also, the talent. The talent that we've picked up when we did the merger with Black & Decker. I'd put my European team in Tools up against any team in the company in terms of just their passion, their commitment, their competency, and their ability to perform. So, that's a – human element is part that too.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill of Zelman and Associates. Your line is now open.
Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman and Associates: Hi, good morning.
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Morning.
Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman and Associates: I was hoping if you guys had a chance, on the Security side, I guess maybe particularly electronics just give us an updated view on where you think you are on some of the operational improvements, good margin this quarter and I think a good trajectory. But not sure, Don, if you kind of want to just think through not necessarily to next year but over the next couple of years. How far into the operational improvements are you? And then, if you can maybe split the comments between North America and International that would be helpful.
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Sure. So, I think we're – if you equate it to a baseball game, I think we're probably still in maybe the fourth inning at this point, related to our progress. We're very pleased, as we mentioned in our comments, mine in particular, about the progress that we're seeing in North America. Europe made great progress over the last few years, but now Europe's kind of hitting the threshold of being close to 10% profitability, and then taking it to the next step, which is closer to the low to mid-teens. That's hard to work and it takes more effort and you also have to have a continued top-line organic growth performance to get some leverage effects as well. But I think each region has made great progress. The Europe journey, the improvement has been going on a little bit longer than in North America, but I still see at this point we're probably going to end the year close to 13% profitability for the segment. Probably just under 13%. And at this stage, we still see a path for it to get to close to 15% as we communicated back at our Investor Day in May of 2015. And we're probably two to three years away from achieving that objective because we're continuing to do a lot of heavy lifting and one of the value proposition items that we see in electronics Security is the ability to really differentiate with customer service and that's what the teams have been focused on for the last year or two. But we still see a world of opportunity in that space to make it better and better, which is only going to enhance our productivity as time goes on.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Chan of Baird. Your line is now open.
Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, Jim and Don.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Donald Allan - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Good morning.
Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Morning. Just wanted to ask about the retail sell-through at the Tools & Storage business, maybe excluding the FLEXVOLT launch. Some of the companies that kind of sell to the same customers have kind of noted a slower July and then trends improving as the quarter progressed. Just wondering what you saw in terms of POS and if you have any comments into the first couple of weeks of October? That would be great. Thank you.
James M. Loree - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Sure, well, our POS at large retail has literally been spectacular in the beginning of the year. Close to the 10% kind of zone for a period of time. And then as the year went on -- so let's say beginning sometime in the second quarter started to sequentially get lower, and it never really got really low and it was always positive, but it was definitely trending sequentially lower up until the FLEXVOLT launch. And at that point we've seen it begin to track sequentially higher. And where we stand on weeks of sale in total is the weeks of sale are substantially lower right now than they were last year. And, I think part of that has to do with good sell-through and increasing sell-through, maybe even beating expectations of the retailers. But, I think also there is an element of structural change that's going on with supply chains at some of the major retailers. So hopefully that gives you some color on POS and sell-through.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the call back over to Mr. Greg Waybright for any closing remarks.
Greg Waybright - Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.: Nicole, thank you. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. And obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q2 2016 Stanley Black & Decker, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Nicole and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.
Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter 2016 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, our President and COO; and Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning John, Jim, and Don will review our second quarter 2016 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. And consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 1934 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren. John?
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Greg. Before we get started, it's with both a sense of accomplishment and admittedly some sadness that we're announcing my retirement today as the CEO of Stanley Black & Decker, effective July 31, 2016. I say there is some sadness simply because of how much I've enjoyed leading the company and our world-class management team and employees, since the first quarter of 2004. But, I am pleased to announce that Jim Loree will be succeeding me as Stanley's Chief Executive Officer, and I am extremely confident in the prospects for this organization with Jim at the helm. For those of you who followed our company over the last several years, this transition will not come as a surprise. I, in conjunction with our board of directors, have always viewed the leadership succession plan to be a top priority to ensure consistency and stability throughout the organization, as well as to ensure that we continue to deliver the exceptional shareholder value that our investors have come to expect from this company. And, to that end, Jim is uniquely positioned to deliver on each of those things, given his tenure with the company and his role in leading the transformation that we've executed over the last decade or so. Furthermore, it's important to note that we have as deep and talented a management team today as we've had at any point during my 12 year tenure with the company. There are strong, competent leaders in place across our various businesses and we're not anticipating any major changes to the strategy or to the team as a result of this announcement. I'll be staying on as Chairman of the board through the end of the year, and I'll continue as a special advisor to the company through the end of April next year in order to ensure an orderly transition, and of course, to assist the board, Jim, and the rest of the management team in any way that I can. I'm proud of everything the company has accomplished over the last 12-plus-years, including compounded annual sales growth of 12%, and a total shareholder return of over 300%. And while I've enjoyed my time here immensely, I'm looking forward to the next phase of my career, which will include, among other things, serving on a number of boards as well as continuing my efforts to impact policy in Washington and around the world, to create an environment where manufacturing companies like ours can continue to succeed and to prosper. I'll turn 65 in September. And rather than thinking of this as going out at the top, I think of it more as a long distance relay race where we've built a good lead and I'm passing the baton to a colleague and a management team who are well positioned and fully capable of increasing that lead. And I'm confident that after you listen to this morning's call, you'll share in my belief that our best days still lie ahead of us. So, let's dive into the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Here's some of the highlights during the second quarter. Organic growth was 4%, total growth was 2%. We had robust organic growth in our Tools & Storage business, 8%, that continues an incredible trend with Europe leading the way at 14% growth during the quarter. Security was up 1%, as Europe organic growth – the trend there continues, Europe was up 3% for the quarter. Industrial was off 6% mainly due to single customer volume pressure in the electronics segment of our Engineered Fastening business, and the well expected lower Infrastructure volumes, as Oil & Gas and Hydraulics remained challenged by the weak energy and scrap steel markets, respectively. Our operating margin rate of 15.8% was up 140 basis points versus same quarter a year ago. That is a post-merger record despite significant foreign currency pressure. That was led by Tools & Storage performance which was up 240 basis points to 18.8%. And Security posted a strong sequential increase to 12.6%, while Industrial declined marginally, but to a very respectable rate of 17%. Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.84 was up 19% versus prior year, on strong operational performance along with a lower share count. Our DEWALT FLEXVOLT battery system was unveiled in June, delivering the power of corded and freedom of cordless to professional and consumer end users worldwide. Some of you have seen the products perform and you'll have your own well-informed views. I've participated in several of the major introductions, and the words "game-changing" have been a common reaction from our customers. The product will hit the shelves in October this year, and Jim will provide you some more detail on our vision to create the cordless jobsite. Given these results, we're raising our 2016 guidance to a range of $6.30 to $6.50; that's up 6% to 10% versus 2015, and from our prior guidance of $6.20 to $6.40 and, concurrently, we're reiterating our free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%. Let's look quickly at the sources of growth. Both volume and price contributed to our growth, which was broad-based on a regional basis. During the second quarter, volume was up 3%, we got a positive 1% from price, for 4% organic growth, currency was a 2 percentage point offset for a revenue growth of 2%. All regions contributed positively to the total performance across the company. You see the U.S. up 3%, Europe up 10%, emerging markets flat, rest of the world up 4%, for again, total organic growth of 4% for the quarter and 4% for the first half of the year. Don will show you later that baked into our guidance is an increase in organic growth for the year from a range of 3% to 4%, to an estimate of 4%. There were lots of puts and calls within the emerging market group, volatile markets as you know, but our Latin American group was up 9%, with Mexico up 11% and Argentina up 46%, albeit from a low base. The emerging markets were down in the low-teens, Tools and Security growth was offset by Industrial softness in the Engineered Fastening consumer electronics business. But, all in all, really strong growth in the quarter. Let me turn it over to Jim, who's got an update on our game-changing DEWALT FLEXVOLT program as well as some of the details on the segment.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, John. Before that I just want to thank John for being a trusted colleague and a mentor, and a friend, and also for all that John has done for this company and our stakeholders over the years. He and I have enjoyed an outstanding business partnership for over 12 years, teaming up to lead the company through a transformation from a small cap building products company to a large cap diversified industrial. It is no coincidence that John's arrival in 2004 marked the beginning of a growth renaissance period for Stanley. And I'm honored to be named as our next CEO, succeeding John, with a mission to lead us through the next stage of our journey. The company has never been stronger, with all its well-established global franchises, agile and deep leadership bench, and strong and evolving SFS2.0 operating system. Importantly, I want to highlight our world-class management team. This high-performing team to a person is totally dedicated to the success of this company. They have supported me all the way, through both their words and their actions, and have thus enabled us to effect a smooth leadership transition. The impressive results you've seen quarter-after-quarter from this company are a direct result of this team's experience, commitment, and passion for winning. What better way to highlight the immense opportunities present in this next stage of our evolution than to introduce you to the first output from breakthrough innovation, our SFS2.0 initiative. The patent-protected DEWALT FLEXVOLT system is the most exciting innovation in the power tool industry since Black & Decker unveiled the first cordless tool in the 1960s. It has the potential to revolutionize the jobsite. It allows users to switch from 20 volt to 60 volt to the never before seen 120 volts of cordless power, using the same battery pack regardless of the voltage rating. These battery packs are completely backwards compatible with our existing line of DEWALT 20 Volt tools, and when used in these products, the FLEXVOLT battery combines with our market-leading brushless motors to provide significant runtime and performance advantages. FLEXVOLT will ultimately enable professional users to completely eliminate the cord on the jobsite, achieving the freedom of cordless while maintaining all the power and flexibility of corded tools. And at the same time, none of our existing user base is left behind, as the FLEXVOLT battery packs used on their new 60 volt and 120 volt cordless tools will also enhance the performance of their existing 20 volt products. FLEXVOLT is being commercialized as part of our SFS2.0 commercial excellence initiative with the most global, most digitally-enabled, and most comprehensive marketing campaign in our history. We have already demonstrated the technology in person to over 700 customers around the globe, including major retailers, distributors, and other channel partners. We have also introduced and demonstrated the products to the tool subject matter expert blogger community and have created an enormous social media buzz in anticipation of the product's release to the market in October. We have coordinated our digital marketing campaign with our sports marketing assets and we will be conducting a massive end user demonstration effort as the summer proceeds. This type of breakthrough innovation, coupled with commercial excellence, will provide significant organic growth runway, even as we comp up against several years of top quartile organic growth among peers. In the near-term, we will focus on delivering the end user's long held dream of the cordless jobsite, and over the intermediate to longer-term, we will be moving up the power curve, exploiting the rapidly advancing technology of electrification and opening up new markets and growth opportunities. This tremendous accomplishment within our Tools & Storage business is the first example of the output we expect to deliver from SFS2.0, our enhanced operating system. We are currently taking the same approach to breakthrough innovation in several other businesses across the company, so stay tuned. I encourage all investors to take a deep dive into both FLEXVOLT and SFS2.0, as they are essential to understanding what this company will deliver in the form of continued organic growth and margin expansion. Our Investor Relations team is ready to assist those that are interested in that regard. Now moving on to 2Q. I'll begin with the Tools & Storage business, which continued its forward momentum delivering another high-single-digit organic growth performance coming in at 8% and equally as impressively improving profitability by 240 basis points for a segment profit rate of 18.8%. Total Tools revenue growth was 5% after absorbing a 3 point currency headwind. Organic growth across all regions and SBUs was once again positive. Europe led the way, up 14%; followed by North America, up 7%; and emerging markets up 4%. The gains in Europe are particularly impressive, given the flat to very low-single-digit growth environment in those markets and they highlight our ability to continue gaining share on the strength of our pervasive commercial excellence activities, and new product development initiatives such as our DC brushless motor products, which exemplify the importance of our very strong core or normal course of business innovation. This all important core innovation activity has been a key source of organic growth and a hallmark of our culture for quite some time. Core innovation provides a solid base for above market growth, thus enabling SFS2.0 breakthrough innovations to turbocharge an already strong base. Moving to global SBU results, Power Tools delivered another double-digit quarter, up 10% with consistent strength across Professional and Consumer Tools and Tools & Storage posted 2% growth as construction hand tools were up in high-single-digits, driven by our new line of DEWALT and FatMax measuring lasers offsetting pressure in Proto industrial hand tools. Taking a regional look at the segment, in North America, momentum was good across all major retailers, with high-single-digit performance from the group. POS data remained very strong and in the mid-teens for the quarter. Ending retailer inventories were in line with or below historical norms. And turning to Europe, which posted extraordinary 14% organic growth on the heels of two years of 7% compounded growth, the outperformance was widespread. Every major underlying market grew organically, with most up double-digits including a noteworthy performance by the U.K. team, which delivered the highest growth in the region. France also showed unusually strong growth, driven by share gains in Professional Power Tools. And finally, emerging markets were up 4% organically, with Latin America and Asia leading the way, both up in high-single-digits, more than offsetting continued issues in Middle East and North America which was down. Latin America continued to overcome a generally distressed market environment. Within Latin America, Argentina and Mexico turned in strong country performances with growth in our Tradesman segment and continued penetration of our recently introduced Stanley MPP cordless Power Tools. E-commerce and pricing excellence initiatives also contributed to drive growth in the region. Asia also delivered a notable performance with good organic growth in China, South Korea, and Indonesia. And as I noted earlier, we continue to see pressure within Middle East, North America, however efforts are underway to revitalize the businesses in those markets which continue to be challenged by severely depressed macroeconomic conditions, amidst geopolitical turmoil. So, in summary, Tools & Storage continued its strong momentum this quarter, leveraging SFS2.0 to drive outsized share gains, while preparing for the largest product launch in the company's history. Despite the challenging macro in several regions of the world, we remain highly constructive on the growth and margin prospects for Tools & Storage as we look forward. Shifting over to Security, Security delivered its second consecutive quarter of organic growth and its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement, highlighting the solid progress this business has made. Total revenues increased 1% on 1% organic growth, while the operating margin rate improved 220 basis points year-over-year to finish at a healthy 12.6% for the quarter, its highest second quarter rate since 2013. Europe Security grew 3% organically for the third quarter in a row, marking its seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth, and strong performance in the Nordics and Central Europe drove the top line performance and offset mild pressure in the U.K. and France. Order intake was in line with expectations. The unit continues to successfully manage attrition and stabilize the RMR portfolio. Europe Security profitability continues to improve, as volume leverage productivity and cost actions all contributed to margin growth and rate improvement in the quarter. North American Security also made progress, solid organic growth in healthcare and automatic doors was offset by lower volumes in electronic security or CSS. However, CSS is driving growth in its RMR portfolio with orders and backlog in a healthy position heading into the second half of the year and attrition is in line with targets. North America also realized margin growth and rate improvement as field efficiency initiatives took hold. In total, Security improved on almost every front with order rates, backlog, and attrition at targeted rates across Europe and North America and the team is well positioned and motivated to continue driving forward progress. Moving on to Industrial, Industrial revenue was under some pressure in the quarter as weakness in Engineered Fastening combined with anticipated pressure in Infrastructure resulted in a 6% organic decline. Expense de-leveraging on lower volume, combined with negative FX, drove a corresponding profit decline although segment margin continued to be at impressive, well above company line average levels. And within Engineered Fastening, the negative growth was overwhelmingly driven by significantly lower than expected volume with one major electronics customer. The general industrial business was down modestly in line with expectations, and the automotive segment remains solid, with fastener growth continuing to outpace light vehicle production around the globe. Infrastructure was down 11% organically as a slowdown in offshore oil and gas activity, combined with continued weakness in hydraulics end markets, resulted in year-over-year declines. Encouragingly, we see sufficient project activity in our onshore business to enable positive growth for Oil & Gas in the second half of the year. So while Industrial posted an eye-opening negative organic growth number for the quarter, it was caused largely by a decline in sales to one specific electronic fastening customer, partially driven by changing end user demand and partially driven by our strategic decision to remain disciplined on price. Nonetheless, segment profitability remains strong, although the revenue impact of this situation will be felt for a few quarters until it anniversaries. So, in summary, like all multi-national businesses in today's environment of slowing global growth, an unprecedented geopolitical volatility, and an ever more rapidly increasing pace of technological change, we face ongoing challenges across our businesses in many of the markets we serve. We view these challenges as opportunities. Our continuing goal is to achieve outsized organic growth, supplement it with inorganic growth, expand margins, and do it all with a capital efficient approach. SFS2.0, with its sharp focus on breakthrough innovation, digital excellence, and commercial excellence, will continue to enable us to outperform on the organic growth front. We will soon be back on the acquisition trail, and our pipeline is full with solid opportunities to deploy capital to inorganic growth. Today's announcement of 4% organic growth, 19% earnings per share growth, a record operating margin rate of 15.8%, and $418 million of free cash flow underscores the health and earnings power of the company while highlighting the strength and agility of our management team. I look forward to leading the company in the coming months and years as we tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and continue to drive positive momentum. And with that, I will now turn it over to Don Allan, who will provide a financial update.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Jim. Let's start with free cash flow for the second quarter, which came in at $418 million for a year-over-year improvement of $171 million. As you can see, the primary drivers of the outperformance were stronger earnings of $44 million and continued improvements in working capital, which generated a positive $58 million of cash in the quarter for a meaningful $108 million of year-over-year improvement. Our working capital turns were 8.2 times at the end of Q2, which was a 1.2 times improvement versus the prior year second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, this leaves our free cash flow $256 million ahead of prior year, again with earnings growth and working capital efficiency explaining essentially all of the improvement. As John noted earlier, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at 100% conversion rate. This takes into account the incremental inventory build that we expect to undertake in the second half of the year related to the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system launch. Even with this modest headwind to working capital in the second half of 2016, we still plan to end the year at approximately 9.5 times for working capital turns. Moving to the next slide, I want to take a moment to address the potential impact of the U.K.'s EU referendum vote, or Brexit, on our anticipated business results in 2016 and potentially beyond. As you can see on this page, we are expecting to generate somewhere north of $500 million in pound sterling denominated revenues in the U.K., and more than $1.7 billion in euro denominated revenues across the euro region in 2016. To-date, we have not seen any meaningful reduction in demand within the U.K. and more broadly in Europe. It is likely too early to speculate on the demand side impact of Brexit in both the U.K. and the rest of Europe. What I can tell you at this point is that our plans for the second half of the year continue to contemplate roughly low- to mid-single-digit growth organically in the European region, as we expect our recent share gain momentum to be further augmented by the FLEXVOLT battery system rollout that Jim discussed in detail earlier. As you might expect, we are monitoring this situation very closely and will continue to assess the potential impact as events evolve. We will update all of you accordingly, as a more definitive picture materializes. From a currency perspective, however, we have seen some impact to our operating margin based on the FX movements following the referendum result. At current spot rates for the euro and pound sterling, we see approximately an $8 million additional currency pressure relative to the $140 million of FX headwind we disclosed in our April guidance. The uncertainty created by the U.K.'s decision, both with regards to the mechanics of their exit as well as the future of the European Union as a whole, could result in continued currency related pressure to our operating margin. I'd like to give you an example of that potential impact. If the euro were to go to parity with the U.S. dollar and the pound were to fall to $1.20, the combination of these moves would generate an incremental $12 million of operating margin pressure to earnings in 2016. This is above and beyond the current $8 million of incremental pressure measured at spot rates that I just mentioned. Of course, the longer FX rates hold at current levels, the more muted the impact any future deterioration will have on 2016 results. I believe this provides an adequate range of the potential worst case impact for 2016. On that note, let's move on to page 14, where we provide an updated view on the net FX impact to the company's operating margin across all currencies. As you can see, net FX headwinds have increased by approximately $10 million to $150 million since our April guidance was issued. This movement is primarily driven by the incremental pound and euro pressures I just mentioned as well as further devaluation of the Argentinian peso and Canadian dollar. These negatives are slightly offset by the appreciation in the Brazilian real, which is up about 7% against the dollar since our April guidance was communicated. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone of a statement I made during the April call, where I pointed out that should FX rates again deteriorate in 2016, we have actions and countermeasures at our disposal to maintain our EPS guidance. We continue to have similar plans in place, but as you would expect, the size of the actions we can effectively execute on begins to shrink as the year wears on. As a result, we now have approximately $20 million in contingency plans that can be put into place should they be necessary. One last point on currency: our hedging actions are now primarily focused on exposures in 2017 and beyond. And we will continue our practice of locking in portions of our largest exposures such as the Canadian dollar and the euro to dampen volatility throughout the year. Based on current spot rates and the existing derivative hedges in place for 2017 volumes, we estimate the carryover impact of currency to be approximately $20 million for 2017. Let's turn our attention to the next page and our updated 2016 outlook. As John noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising our EPS outlook to a range of $6.30 to $6.50 from the April guidance range of $6.20 to $6.40. The revised range represents a 6% to 10% year-over-year increase in EPS. At the same time, we are reiterating our free cash flow conversion at approximately 100% of net income. As you can see on the left side of the page, this 10% increase across the range is being driven by an increased organic growth estimate for the full year, moving to 4% from approximately 3% to 4%, which generates $0.07 of additional EPS. In addition, we believe $0.10 of our incremental productivity and cost actions will stick for the full year. Embedded in this amount is modest incremental growth costs related to SFS2.0 initiatives. Specifically, these costs will fund key incremental commercial excellence, and breakthrough innovation activities to help drive above-market growth beyond 2016. These two positive improvements to guidance are partially offset by $0.07 of increased FX headwind and one-time new CEO costs. Finally, note that we are providing some color on EPS for 3Q, with approximately 25% of the full year EPS expected to be delivered in the third quarter. Moving to the right-hand side of the page, you get a better sense of the drivers behind the organic growth increase, as Tools & Storage is now projected to grow high-single-digits for the year on the great momentum we have seen in the first half combined with the impact of the pending FLEXVOLT launch. However, some of these gains are being partially offset by our Industrial segment as we continue to see pressure in the general industrial and electronics businesses, which is now projected to produce low-single-digit declines in 2016. The organic growth guidance for the Security segment remains unchanged, with low-single-digit growth expected for the full year. Finally, we expect the Tools & Storage and Security segments to deliver positive year-over-year improvements to their respective operating margin rates. The Industrial segment's operating margin rate will be lower in 2016 versus 2015, as the impact from lower volume and FX pressure more than offsets the productivity gains and cost actions being taken by the Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure business teams. In summary, the second quarter was another solid performance for the company as a whole. Despite some additional pressures in our Industrial segment, Tools & Storage delivered an outstanding quarter. And the Security businesses continue to make solid progress and take additional positive steps forward. Organic growth for the quarter finished up 4%, and earnings per share were up 19% versus prior year, coming in at $1.84, excellent operating leverage. On the back of this outperformance, we are raising EPS guidance to the range of $6.30 to $6.50, as we expect the improved organic growth outlook and incremental productivity to more than offset certain pressures. In June, we introduced the world to DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which we expect to revolutionize the construction jobsite, delivering the power of corded with the freedom of cordless to millions of professionals around the world. And finally, we announced the retirement of John as CEO. His tenure has been an era that is characterized by transformational growth and exceptional shareholder returns. Among John's many accomplishments as CEO is the impact he had on building our high integrity, agile winning business culture across our entire executive leadership team and, as a result, we are well positioned to deliver outsized growth and margin expansion going forward. And we have a highly energized organization motivated toward achieving these goals. On a personal note, I have appreciated John's mentorship and thank him for the support over the past decade. That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Let's move to Q&A.
Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations: Great. Thanks, Don. Nicole, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys, good morning. John, best of luck to you going forward and, to Jim, congratulations.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: I was wondering if you could provide some detail on what your assumptions are for growth in the various verticals within fastening and for industrial infrastructure in the back half or for the year.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. I'd be happy to do that. So, in the Industrial segment, we were down 6% here in the second quarter. We don't expect the decline to be as severe in the back half of the year, probably low-single-digits, with it being a little larger in the third quarter and smaller in the fourth quarter as the comps get easier, in particular related to the electronics business. When you look at the different pieces, we do feel pretty good about our automotive fastener business in the back half of the year. It's seen a strong performance in the first half, up mid-single-digits as far as organic growth. And then in the back half, we expect that trend to continue as we get over a more difficult comp related to some of the equipment sales that we had in the first half related to the automotive systems business. The electronics business will continue to be a pressure point in the back half, although as the comps will slowly get easier as time goes on. We would expect that to be a rather large negative V in the back half as it has been in the first half and the general industrial business will kind of be a low- to mid-single-digit decline, as well, in the back half.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys. And I guess congratulations to John and Jim both.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thanks.
Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: On the Tools margins, clearly strong execution this quarter. I think a host of things, productivity and likely price cost included. Can you maybe give us a bit of a trend line? I know you have FLEXVOLT launch costs here in the second half and FX, but maybe excluding those out, how should we think about incremental margins or how should we think about the margin from here and maybe the line of sight beyond some of the 2016 launch costs? Just given the outperformance that we saw in this quarter.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, I think obviously the second quarter was an outstanding margin performance and organic growth performance, as Jim mentioned, for Tools & Storage. As we look at the back half, we still see very strong margins. We're certainly not going to see 18.8% at this stage because of some of the reasons that you mentioned. We're also beginning to anniversary the commodity deflation that we've experienced over the last year. That's been a strong benefit for the business and will not be a continued incremental benefit on a go-forward basis. And then FLEXVOLT, as you mentioned, is an area that is an initial pressure point to gross margins as we roll that out. Over time, they will be accretive to gross margins as we get deeper into the launch next year, and then we also have launch costs that are specific to this program that will continue out through the remainder of 2016, which means that the gross margins in the back half of the year will be roughly somewhere between the 15.5% to 16.5% range, most likely because of those dynamics. The ongoing margins, however, from an incremental margin perspective will continue to be healthy and consistent with what we've said in the past, that as we see organic growth, incrementally we would expect 30% to 35% drop through in margins, sometimes affected by specific quarter activities where it might be slightly lower if we're making investments or if there's certain types of mix that occurs. But our trend line over the long term for Tools & Storage is still positive. They will likely end the year close to 17% operating margin, if not slightly over. We'll see how the year progresses. And we would expect that they would continue to improve from that on a go-forward basis.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, John, Jim, congratulations. This is actually Evelyn Chow pinch hitting for Joe. Maybe just focusing on the gross margins for the company as a whole. They were incredibly strong this quarter. In your release you cited a few different factors and you mentioned commodity deflation has helped. Can you provide some more color on the relative contributions of the drivers you cited and the sustainability of this kind of expansion?
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, sure, I'll take it. You want to take it Jim?
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, I'll take it because this is something that we work really hard on at this company. You think about the gross margin performance this quarter in light of the FX pressures that we had, which almost totaled $40 million, it is really remarkable that we've been able to achieve this kind of accretion in the gross margin rate and what it really derives from working on everything that we possibly can to impact the margin rate in a positive way. And that starts with productivity and working hard on four wall cost productivity, working hard on vendor productivity, G&A productivity, our functional transformation initiative starting to pay some dividends, the commercial excellence initiative from SFS2.0, we're driving price realization, price optimization, all these things kind of combined, we are very, very focused on managing mix, focused on managing the lifecycle of new products, or products in general, and introducing new products at higher margins as the more mature products kind of margin has a degrading tendency over time. It's a combination of all those things, and we continue to target gross margin improvements over the medium-term, as well, and I think you'll see that over the coming years as a result of everything I just mentioned.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. Congratulations and best wishes, John and congratulations, Jim.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Rich.
Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I'm going to squeeze in a couple here. Just on the inflection in margin and Security. Just thoughts around if this is a true inflection, any puts and takes as we think about the back half, sustained momentum, comments along those, and then on electronics with the one customer being such a headwind, what's the focus on progress in terms of trying to diversify the customer base? Thank you.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Don, go ahead. Let me just say, Rich, you're talking two different businesses: Security and then you're moving to Fastening. We'll get them both. But the sequential consistent improvement in Security, it's real and it's here to stay. In Europe, the team has really embraced the need to grow organically and they've done it consistently in a very tough market. U.S., the focus has been more on operational excellence, field efficiency, and both teams focusing on what we've asked them to focus on and they're doing a great job on both fronts. But I'll let Don answer your question specifically.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, so, John is absolutely correct that the Security business continues to generate a positive momentum around various initiatives, specific to profitability. We've talked about several of them over the last year or so on different occasions as driving more efficient field productivity, really trying to streamline their SG&A, to achieve certain objectives over the long-term as a percentage of revenue, and they continue to make progress in that regard. And combining that with the fact that they're being much more disciplined around pricing and the new business that they enter into so they ensure the right levels of profitability on new business, have allowed us to continue to increase the profitability. And you just see in the first half, we had roughly 12%, just under 12% profitability in Q1 and then 12.6% in Q2, and we think that's a good indicator of the trend that we'll see in the back half, and for obviously the full year, with hopefully being close to 100 basis points improvement year-over-year in operating margin rate in that business. And the good news is that we're seeing in all three regions. Obviously, emerging markets is relatively small, but in the case of North America and Europe, we're seeing traction in both regions in a significant way, and we see more opportunity for additional upside as we continue this disciplined approach on a go-forward basis. As it relates to specifics to electronics business within Engineered Fastening and Industrial, yeah, I think that's a business that we continue to be very disciplined with, and around pricing, and we're interested in certainly some aspects of that business, but as a result of some of these decisions as well as some of the customer decisions that have been made over the last year, the business has shrunk dramatically and now represents close to $70 million on an annualized basis. And we think, for the long-term, that's probably a reasonable number somewhere between $50 million to $70 million, but we'll see where we go from here but that's kind of how we're viewing the business at this stage.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And also, I'd like to add my congrats to Jim and John. My question is focused around raw materials. If you could just kind of remind us what the changes in raw materials has impacting 2016, if that's changed at all with the move in steel prices, and I know it's obviously very early on right now, but maybe how to start thinking about, with the recent move in steel, how that may or may not impact 2017 and if there's certain hedges or pricing offsets that you think are in your wheelhouse to offset any pressures into next year.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure, Mike. This is Don. I'll take that. We think this year we're probably getting about $40 million to $50 million of benefit from commodity deflation, and a lot of that primarily is in the first half, as we're really starting to anniversary some of those benefits that we started experiencing last summer. And so, in the back half of the year, we don't expect incremental improvement and we might even see a little bit of pressure in certain commodities as you just touched on a couple of them but we don't expect that to be material in the second half of the year. We have mentioned previously that we had locked into a lot of commodity-based contracts with certain key vendors earlier this year for the remainder of 2016. So that will clearly probably create a little bit of pressure in 2017. At this stage, we think it's a manageable number, below $25 million for the full year, but obviously we'll continue to monitor commodity prices as we always do throughout the remainder of 2016, but that's kind of where we are at this stage.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs of Baird. Your line is now open.
Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, good morning, everybody, and I'll add my congratulations to Jim and John as well. I guess just quick, a two-part question on Security. First, in North America, that business has organically been declining for the past few quarters, and I noticed that the tone was a little bit more positive on orders and backlog. So, maybe if you can just talk a little bit about when we can see an inflection in growth in the North American part of Security. And then second, just given your improvement in Europe, could you talk about what the margin differential is now between North America and Europe?
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Jim is going to take that. We've had the good fortune of spending a lot of time with both those businesses, Tim, just very recently, so we're really up to speed. And, Jim, why don't you take it?
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure. The simple one is the second question which is about 400 basis points of difference at this point in time. And as far as the volume in North America, they've been working really hard on getting their field execution up to a level where the orders and the backlog can be installed efficiently and in a timely fashion. And I'd say the one thing that gives us the ability to be at what we think is an inflection point is the fact that the field has made a lot of progress in North America, so we actually haven't had that much of an issue generating the orders, and we have the ability to go out and generate even more orders. However, we've been throttling that a little bit as the field was sort of a bottleneck. And so that's really the answer, is the reason we're more optimistic about our ability to generate modest growth in electronic security in North America is because the field execution is improving, and the field capacity is, therefore, improving. Now, just as a side note, there's several components of North America which are doing just fine, in terms of growth, including the automatic door business and mechanical security, so this is the third leg of the stool, if you will, and once we get that moving in a positive direction, I think we'll be in a similar situation that we are in Europe, where we're generating organic growth on a more consistent basis.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, thanks, and congratulations, John and Jim. Wanted to also ask about Security, and it looked like there were some small bolt-on recurring revenue acquisitions in the quarter. So just wondering if you could give a little more color on that, and if we should interpret this as kind of a sign that you feel comfortable enough that this business is on solid footing that you'll embark on – or you'll re-embark on some inorganic growth initiatives within Security?
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: We actually do feel that the business is on solid enough footing in both North America and in Europe to digest a few small bolt-on acquisitions. And in fact, we are thinking along the lines that these types of bolt-on – RMR acquisitions, basically, is what they are – will supplement the installation business in terms of generating RMR, and that one of the keys to success in electronic security is to get the RMR portfolio, that's recurring monthly revenue for those that are unfamiliar with that term, but to get that portfolio sequentially increasing every quarter in both of those geographies. And the combination of installation growth and attrition management and small bolt-on acquisitions – we almost think of them as if they were CapEx for growth in the Security business. So you'll continue to see small ones. As far as major acquisitions in Security, no, there's nothing on the horizon in the medium-term – short- to medium-term, for that. We're actually enjoying working on operational excellence and execution in the business to – at the customer level in particular, to ensure that while all this consolidation is going on in the industry, we are providing the customers with the absolute best value proposition possible. And we think that we can continue to gain share – we're gaining share already in Europe and I think we can continue to gain share in Europe, and in the North American business I think we can begin to gain some share along the way with that as a strategy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron of CLSA. Your line is now open.
Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC: Hi, good morning.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Good morning.
Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC: John, Jim, congratulations and all the best in your new roles.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Jeremie.
Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC: Have a question on the Tools business. I think you made some pretty positive comments regarding the inventory situation in some of the large distributors and also point-of-sale data, so if you could come back to those comments and maybe provide a little more color here. And also, I'd like to hear how we should think about quantifying the impact of the FLEXVOLT launch going into the end of the year, and the next year. What kind of numbers and benchmarks are you looking at to measure the success of FLEXVOLT? Thanks.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Jeremie, it's John, I'll start and turn it over to Don. In terms of inventories, inventories are in great shape, both from our perspective and our customers'. I think it's important to note that our large customers have done a really, really good job mining data, working with us in a collaborative – with all their suppliers, but certainly us among their largest, in a collaborative manner, to get weeks at retail down to the 8 to 9 range, when historically 10 to 12 was as well as they could do without being out of stock. So the silver lining in the cloud for us is retail inventory – for us and our customers – retail inventories are at about their lowest levels that they've been in years, but despite that sell-off or decline in inventory, we've been able to grow nicely, and from the customers' perspective, in-stock is as good as it's been. Our fill rates are as good as they've ever been. So it's really the power of sharing the data on a collaborative basis, and sell-through remains good. So we see no issues in terms of inventory adjustment going forward. What I'll say on FLEXVOLT so far, and Don will quantify it to the extent he feels comfortable, so far so good. The customers have responded really, really well. We're capacitized to fill a tremendous amount of demand to the extent it exceeds our expectations. But I'm going to let Don quantify that to the extent that he's comfortable doing so.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, John. So...
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You get the hard ones.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I appreciate that. As we mentioned related to breakthrough innovation, just as a reminder to everybody, when we have major programs like this, our expectation is it will generate at least $100 million of revenue over a three year period, and clearly we think FLEXVOLT is going to exceed that, probably exceed it in a very significant way. As we look at 2016, we've had initially very high demand for the product. We expect, as Jim said, for it to hit the stores in late September, early October, and as a result, I indicated previously that I think we'll probably experience here in 2016, as a percentage for the total company, about a half a point of growth when you look at the entire year. And so that would be roughly $50 million to $60 million. That number could creep up as we go throughout the fourth quarter and could become closer to 0.75%, so we'll see how that progresses, but that's kind of the range you should look at initially. As we think about 2017, we would expect this to be probably a multi-hundred million dollar program next year, likely around $200 million, but we'll see as the year progresses and the success of the launch. We think the launch will be very, very successful. What we'd be looking at is the sell-through and how strong the sell-through is in the initial 90 days and how quickly the inventory turns, and we've clearly positioned ourselves through all the things that Jim mentioned around commercial excellence and digital excellence to try to maximize that opportunity.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: Yes. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, gentlemen, to you both. My question was with respect to the European Tools & Storage growth. You talked about new products, you talked about expanded retail distribution. I guess I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the sustainability of that growth and maybe how much runway is left with the retail distribution side of that or just deconstruct the drivers and talk about the sustainability.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, and anybody that had 14% organic growth in Europe and said it was sustainable would not be credible. So I mean, I think that's a very special performance. And we're on the heels of the two years of 7% comps which makes it even more challenging. But having said that, the European Tools team is literally on a rampage, a growth rampage, and the environment is the big unknown over there and the success of FLEXVOLT is also a big unknown. So it's difficult to say – peg a number. But I think the one thing that we can say for certain is that whatever the market is, we will continue to outperform it over there and continue to gain share for the foreseeable future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie. Your line is now open.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. John, I hope you enjoy your retirement, and, Jim, congratulations. My question is on the innovation in Tools. Is the 1% or so price gain that you've been reporting sustainable and part of your internal goals going forward? And is there any potential for bigger innovation in Hand Tools to move the needle on the 2% growth there that is well below the growth you're seeing in Power Tools? Thank you.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Starting with the innovation in Hand Tools, the innovation in Hand Tools is quite robust, actually, and it is really remarkable how much innovation there is in products that are relatively simple – seemingly relatively simple. The reason the organic growth in Hand Tools is a bit lower right now is not because of any lack of innovative growth because there is a fair amount of that, most notably the lasers in this past quarter. The pressure in the Hand Tools business derives largely from the weakness in the industrial channels, in particular, our Proto branded products are relatively – have negative offsetting the positive growth in the other area. And then the first part of the question? Why don't you just repeat the first part of the question?
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Probably can't... (54:23)
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Can you remember what it was?
Operator: One moment.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: 2%
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: I think it was more around... (54:31)
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: It was just Hand Tools, 2%. Could we ramp up organic growth on Hand Tools, which is 2%, which is below Power Tools. And I think you got it.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Okay. I hope so, if not, Mike, obviously you can follow-up with Greg, because I know after your question you didn't have access to speak again.
Operator: All right. And our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.
Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC: Hi, just a quick two-parter, I guess just on the transition. Jim, is your COO role going to be backfilled either immediately or over time? And then just looking for an update with respect to how you guys would phrase the Security strategy now. I think we're about a year past the initial review. It sounds like status quo, but just wanted to hear how you're thinking about it.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: I'll answer the first part of the question and then I'll turn it over to Don who will give his regular answer to that question. The answer is, no backfill for the COO role right away. There may at some point in time as the succession plan for me is developed and so on, it may be filled, it may not be, that all remains to be seen at this point. And then, Don, on the Security portfolio strategy.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, absolutely. So, you're right, Dennis, we made an announcement a little more than a year ago about our evaluation of this portfolio. We, frankly, really began that evaluation in the early parts of this year, with last year more focused on continued improvement of the operational performance across the board and we're starting to see some of the fruit from that labor. And we had a good discussion at this board meeting and we will likely have another one in October, hopefully that will solidify our discussion and we'll be able to announce something post-October. But we've looked at obviously the three options we've discussed previously, which is keeping the entire business, potentially selling or spinning the entire business, or divesting a portion of it and we specifically had mentioned our mechanical lock business as a potential candidate for that. So we continue to evaluate those. I would say that, it's getting very close to the finish line, and I would imagine in the next 90 days to 120 days, we'll have something very clear to say on that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC: Thank you. And it's interesting – firstly, congratulations to both John and congratulations to Jim. Keeping the Security questions going, which is kind of unusual for all these – after all these years, looking at the various components of what makes up the electronic security side of your business, and looking at some of the smaller parts of it, that have been added and you've been showing off at tradeshows such as healthcare, and Sonitrol and tracking, things like that. You're talking still about fairly slow growth, but consistent growth, on the electronics side. Is there going to be a point at which some of these higher-growing areas begin to start affecting the overall growth of electronic security, particularly in North America, or indeed in Europe if they begin to add to that, as you begin to try to start adding more value, and offering more value to your customers out there?
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: The answer is yes, but I'll let Jim give you a little more detail.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: This industry that we're talking about, electronic security, is in very rapid flux right now, as I think most people know. And the IoT, in particular, the cloud, advanced analytics, these types of things are all impacting our industry. And, in fact, our industry is extremely well positioned to exploit some of those technological advances. And we're working very diligently and aggressively on several verticals, including healthcare and retail in particular in the United States, and in Europe we're taking a bit of a different approach where we're working more on specific applications and then trying to market those, generally kind of in the $1 million to $5 million annual revenue range, whereas the healthcare and retail solutions are a little bit higher ticket. The growth from those activities in the higher end verticals, the real key is to create this recurring revenue business model that will provide superior profitability and, therefore, enable us to get paid for the value. That is definitely something that we've been able to accomplish in healthcare, and now, in healthcare, we're really investing in significant growth because the next challenge that one faces in these types of verticals is scaling, and being able to make those significant investments that enable 10%, 20%, 30% growth. And that's challenging in a business that's in kind of a turnaround profitability mode, but we're going ahead and making some of those investments. In fact, healthcare is one area where we're doing it, retail is another one here in the States. Now, the fundamental growth model in traditional electronic security is always very challenging to grow it quickly because of the high recurring revenue content of the total revenue base, which means that – and also the attrition in the recurring revenue portfolio, which goes back to one of the reasons I think these bolt-on RMR acquisitions are a good idea because it takes some of the pressure off of the installation growth and the attachment of RMR to that installation revenue, and it enables more investment in kind of the high-growth areas. So you will see, over time, an improvement in a more consistent – in the growth rate and a more consistent growth rate coming out of electronic security, which is one of the reasons that we like the business because it does have that stable revenue stream once you get it moving in the right direction. And that's what we're really attempting to do right now.
Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC: Is what you're doing in healthcare and in retail, is it portable to other verticals?
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: I would say it's probably 60% to 70% portable. Lots of times there's platforms that and certain technologies like IoT, cloud, analytics that you have those capabilities within the organization, but then there's application-specific activities that have to be tailored to specific applications, whether it's in a hospital or whether we're working on electronic article surveillance in a retail establishment. So that part of it, I'll call it the other 40%, is not portable.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Jeff, said differently, and you know this as well as anyone, in any vertical about 50% of what we do is standardized across every vertical, but about 50% of what we do in a vertical is unique to that vertical, which is why we go to market that way. But to Jim's point, a whole lot of what we're doing is portable and we're looking forward to leveraging those opportunities.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Greg Waybright for any closing remarks.
Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations: Great. Nicole, thank you very much. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning, for your participation on your call and your questions and your comments. And, clearly, please contact me if you have any further questions, and thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2016 Stanley Black & Decker Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kylie and I will be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.
Greg Waybright: Great, thank you, Kylie, and good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker’s first quarter 2016 conference call. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, our President and COO, and Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. And a replay of this morning’s call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning John, Jim, and Don will review our first quarter 2016 results and various other matters followed by Q&A session. And consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It’s therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. With that I’ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John Lundgren: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us, and for those of you who have had a chance to look at our earnings release, it should point out that we remain strongly focused on generating above-market organic growth, meaningful operating leverage, and strong free cash flow conversion. We’ve really got a lot of really good news to report on the quarter, as well as some real excitement looking forward. So I’m going to be very quick through some of the highlights, before turning it over to Jim and Don for more granularity and then of course we’ll get on to the Q&A. Organically, we grew 5% total growth of 2%, the difference being currency. Really robust organic growth in Tools & Storage 8% with significant outperformance in the emerging markets which was nice to see that come back, 9%. Jim will give you a lot more detail on the strong global Tools & Storage performance in just a second. Industrial was down 3%, as we anticipated, and Security was up 1%, as the positive organic growth in Europe continues. It’s a trend that we’ve been very focused on and we’re very pleased to see it carrying on the way it has. Operating margin rate of 13.1% was 20 basis points below last year, the overwhelming majority of that was the impact of $35 million of currency pressure. Security industrial operating margin rates were up 110 basis points and 120 basis points respectively, and Tools & Storage was down slightly in the face of the currency headwinds as most of you are aware the overwhelming majority of our FX does impacts our global Tools & Storage business. That led to diluted earnings per share up 20%, $1.28, up 20% versus prior year, solid operating performance combined with lower share count, lower restructuring costs, which more than offset the currency impact. So on the back of the first quarter performance – outperformancee, we’re raising 2016 outlook for EPS to a range of $6.20 to $6.40, which is up 5% to 8% versus 2015, and up from our $6 to $6.20 range that we most recently provided. Concurrently, we’re reiterating free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income. Let’s turn briefly to the sources of the growth, during the first quarter. Volume was up 4%, price was up 1%, leading to the 5% organic growth that I already touched on. Currency was a 3% offset, so a total revenue growth of 2%. This compares to 1% organic growth, and a 5% currency driven revenue decline in the fourth quarter 2015, so very, very strong sequential quarterly trend. Turning to the regions, you can see that all markets contributed. The U.S. was up 6%, Europe up 3%, total emerging market group was up 3%, which of course was led by global Tools & Storage, a very strong performance, and the rest of the world was up 1%. So all in all, a really solid first quarter growth performance with strength across virtually every business and in virtually every region, but let’s let Jim get into some of the details on our three segments, there’s a lot of really good news this morning.
Jim Loree: Okay, thanks, John. I’ll begin with our Tools & Storage business, which as John indicated started the year off with another strong showing, once again hitting an all cylinders and growing a robust 8% organically in the quarter against a 1Q 2015 comp of 10% growth. The Tools team continued to outperform the market globally as commercial excellence initiatives, supply chain efficiency and a laser focus on innovation and new product development translated into market share gains across product lines and around the world. This is being accomplished against a volatile macroeconomic backdrop, characterized by large and unpredictable swings in foreign currencies, geopolitical unrest and anemic global GDP growth. Total Tools revenue growth was 4%, after absorbing a 4% currency headwind. Currency also impacted operating margin more than offsetting volume leverage, price and modest commodity deflation resulting in a 40 basis point decline and the year-over-year operating margin rate. The consistency of organic growth across the regions and SBUs was particularly impressive with North America leading the way, up 10%, followed closely by very strong emerging markets at 9%, and Europe with a solid 5% growth performance. Regarding the global Tools & Storage SBUs, Power Tools posted 10% organic growth with its underlying product lines: professional, consumer, and accessories, each individually generating 10% growth. The Hand Tools & Storage business delivered a solid performance as well growing 5% organically with NPD and healthy end-markets, fueling 10% growth in construction hand tools. Automotive repair and industrial was a mixed bag with continued robust performance in Mac Tools, a flattish fathom, more than offsetting anticipated, but slightly better than expected negative pressure in North American industrial channels. Skew placement success stories were widespread with our new Porter-Cable cordless Nailer gaining listings in multiple outlets, gains with our mechanics Tools and Mac, high access ratchets and continued momentum within the DEWALT DC brushless and pneumatic products. Within North America, the retail channel posted double-digit gains as strong POS performance was driven by supportive construction and DIY markets, a mild winter, especially compared to 2015 and pervasive new product introductions as well as continued share gains from DC brushless and the made in USA initiative. Targeted conversion efforts and promotional wins led to high single-digit growth in the commercial channel, while a successful Mac tool fair helped to offset aforementioned pressure in the industrial channels, which remained down albeit with sequential improvement in the quarter. Turning to Europe, which was up 5% organically, the story continued with nearly all geographic markets again posting positive performances, share gains coupled with surgical pricing actions delivered above market growth as SFS 2.0 commercial excellence activities continued to take hold. The e-commerce channel was another highlight as innovations in our consumer products group and the implementation of a broader and deeper go-to market approach generated significant year-over-year gains. Last but not least the emerging market team put together an outstanding quarter under the circumstances, posting a 9% organic gain. This progress derived from a combination of innovation and new product launches as part of our mid price point or MPP initiative, coupled with aggressive price recovery actions taken early in the year to combat currency declines where appropriate. Latin America served up a stellar performance in the quarter, achieving mid-teens growth on the back of extensive commercial excellence initiatives in Mexico, Peru, and Argentina, which more than offset ongoing market headwinds in Brazil. High single-digit growth in Asia combined with the LatAm performance more than offset country specific pressures in the Middle East and Africa. All in all, the Tools & Storage business started the year vigorously and remains fixated on maintaining its strong growth momentum. The team is leveraging SFS 2.0 initiatives to continue driving tactical share gains and effecting a digital transformation across the enterprise, and at the same time, they’re preparing for a major new power tool product rollout in the second half as the breakthrough innovation pillar of SFS 2.0 will soon come to life and begin to contribute to our commercial success, stay tuned. Now turning to Security, which continued to progress on multiple fronts in the first quarter. Security posted 1% organic growth, made significant progress on profitability, and improved year-over-year margins by 110 basis points. Within Europe, the business was up 3% organically for the second quarter in a row, achieving its 6th consecutive quarter in positive territory. Higher installation revenues and multiple geographies highlighted by gains in France, the Nordics and Central Europe were the primary growth drivers. Profitability continued to rise as volume leverage, productivity and cost actions all contributed to year-over-year margin rate increases. Solid order rates in the quarter and continued progress on the commercial front positioned us to maintain this momentum. North American Security also made good strides. Operational improvements from field productivity gains, under the Stanley standard field operations initiative, drove the year-over-year profitability increase. While organic revenue declined, it was attributable primarily to lower volumes in the automatic doors business, which has good visibility to rebounding sales in 2Q. The CSS business’ top-line was flat year-over-year, and backlog remained in a healthy position going into 2Q. And overall, Security posted its highest operating profit rate since the first quarter of 2012, highlighting the growing success of turnaround initiatives through improved operating performance. Although work remains to be done, which translates to opportunity, we continue to be pleased with Security’s trends and development. Moving on to industrial, results for the segment were in line with expectations as lower volumes in Engineered Fastening’s industrial and electronics businesses combined with a tough comp in automotive system sales, led to an overall 3% organic sales decline for the quarter. Infrastructure was flat as oil and gas gains stemming from increased onshore pipeline activity, offset continued pressure within hydraulics. Overall, industrial segment profitability improved 120 basis points, as productivity and cost controls particularly within Engineered Fastening more than offset lower volumes. In this regard, the Engineered Fastening business performed well notwithstanding the anticipated top-line pressures. Automotive fastener sales growth remained healthy and outpaced light vehicle production. Productivity gains stemming from an intense focus on cost management and supply chain efficiency through core SFS led to the highest first quarter gross margin rate in five years. The infrastructure business continued to deliver mixed results with oil and gas posting double-digit organic growth while providing good visibility to onshore pipeline projects coming online over the balance of the year and into 2017. Hydraulics on the other hand continued to suffer volume declines due to a persistently difficult steel scrap market and in total both our first quarter results for the company and our ability to guide 2016 upward, was a demonstration of the company’s underlying growth and earnings power. Robust organic growth in Tools & Storage, coupled with profitability improvements in Security and Industrial, leave us well positioned to achieve our upwardly revised 2016 outlook. And before turning it over to Don I want to remind everyone that we’re also continuing to embed SFS 2.0 into the organization to enable sustained above market organic growth and margin expansion along with high asset efficiency. We’re focusing our activities in 5 key areas: Commercial excellence, digital excellence, break through innovation, functional transformation, and core SFS. We have clearly seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in our organic growth and margin expansion and as I said on our January Earnings Call and during my earlier Tools & Storage comments, you will begin to see an exciting and growing impact from break through innovation as the year progresses. You may also see some inorganic activity in the near future, as we have capital to deploy and are actively developing an acquisition pipeline with emphasis on bolt-ons in the tools and industrial segments. These are truly exciting times for our company with outsized capital efficient growth, solid inorganic growth opportunities ahead, and an ever present focus on margin expansion all contributing to the mix. With that I’ll now turn it over to Don Allan who will provide the financial update.
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim, good morning. Let’s begin with a look at our free cash flow for the first quarter which was an outflow of $158 million, an improvement of $85 million from the first quarter of 2015. The primary driver of the year over year improvement was a stronger working capital performance, specifically within inventory and accounts receivable. As our working capital turns were up four turns finishing the quarter at seven turns. Higher income in the current year quarter served to offset the majority of increased capital expenditures as well as some negative cash outflows in the other line. The other line items, which were primarily a reflection of timing of pension plan and miscellaneous accrual payments as compared to the prior year. As a reminder the outflow of cash in the first quarter is normal seasonality where our Tools & Storage inventory levels rise to ensure we’re adequately prepared for the Q2 and Q3 demands of our key customers in the developed market. As John mentioned earlier and as you can see here in the take away we’re reiterating our free cash flow guidance at a conversion rate of approximately 100% of net income. So let’s turn to page 10 as I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwind. By this point all of you are likely very familiar with our currency trends chart which over the last two years has consistently depicted worsening FX headwinds on the back of perpetually strengthening U.S. dollar. For also the first time in what seems like quite a while we actually saw a tempering of the dollar momentum over the quarter followed by an eventual retreat against some of our key foreign currencies. Most notably the Canadian Dollar, the Brazilian Real and the Euro. While on a full year basis we’re still seeing significant currency headwinds weighing on our operating margin of approximately $140 million, this does represent a $40 million improvement from the midpoint of our initial 2016 guidance range, which was $170 million to $190 million. As we established that in late January time frame. As a reminder we assessed our currency headwinds on operating margin at the current spot rate. It’s worth noting that the mix of this $140 million headwind is now comprised of approximately 75% transactional exposure, which pressures our margin rate, and 25% translational exposure, this is a shift from the two thirds one third split we discussed in January. And is driven by the $60 million of carryover currency exposures, which relate to our 2015 hedging activities. While we continue to execute on mitigating actions to offset the $140 million of headwinds it’s important to note that we do anticipate some pressure on planned pricing actions particularly in countries where currencies have rebounded significantly. This will materialize as a slight headwind to organic growth specifically in the second half of 2016. Finally you will notice that on the lower right hand side of the page we have presented our sensitivities for several of our most significant foreign currency exposures. These will be useful guides for you going forward to determine how movements in the FX markets are impacting our 2016 operating margin so for example a 1% increase in the Canadian dollar results in a $2 million to $3 million improvement in the 2016 operating margin on an annual basis. Now let’s turn to the next slide which is an update on our 2016 outlook and guidance. We are raising our 2016 EPS outlook to a range of $6.20 to $6.40 from the prior range of $6 to $6.20. This revised range represents an approximately 5% to 8% increase over 2015. We’re also reiterating our free cash flow as I previously mentioned. The major changes behind the guidance increase are as follows. As you can see we’re now expecting organic growth of 3% to 4%, versus the original estimate of approximately 3%. The primary drivers of the change are an increase in our Tools & Storage growth assumption to mid single digits on the back of a solid first quarter performance, strong POS data and signs of continued strength in resi and non-resi construction markets. However this strength is partially offset by revisions to industrials organic growth outlook, which we now see as relatively flat versus an assumption of up slightly in our initial guidance. This revision is due primarily to lower than anticipated volumes in Engineered Fastening’s Electronics business. As volume expectations for the largest customer in that business continued to decline. Additionally we expect the timing shift around certain oil and gas pipeline projects from the second half of 2016 as they move into the first half of 2017. Finally as I mentioned earlier, there’s also some pricing pressure relative to our initial estimates coming from certain foreign markets that have recently seen significant strengthening in their currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Accordingly we expect all these puts and takes around our organic growth assumptions to result still in a net increase to our EPS of approximately $0.05. The next item which we discussed in length on the previous slide is the approximately $40 million improvement in foreign exchange headwinds, which we expect to translate to an increase of EPS of approximately $0.20 for the full year. Then finally slightly higher than planned marketing costs related to the Tools & Storage product launch that Jim alluded to and discussed briefly a few minutes ago are expected to result in approximately $0.05 reduction to EPS, the majority of these costs will occur in the second half of 2016. These three assumptions changes result in a net increase of $0.20. Turning to the segment outlook to Tools & Storage and industrial segments organic growth outlook, change along the lines I just previously discussed. And Securities organic growth outlook remains low single digit. In terms of profitability, Tools & Storage is the only change from our January guidance, moving to modestly positive year over year, from relatively flat. And the driver of that is the reduction in the FX headwinds primarily. We continue to expect Security’s margin to be modestly positive year over year as operational and field efficiency improvements continue to progress and in the industrials margin to be relatively flat with productivity gains and cost takeouts being able to offset the top line pressures we continue to see. The last point I’d like to make is related to our EPS guidance expectations for the first half of 2016. As you can see we expect first half 2016 operating profits as a percentage of the full year to be slightly above the prior-year period. However, lower planned restructuring as well as lower other net expenses and shares will result in first half EPS being higher as a percentage of the full year than it was in the prior year, specifically first half 2016 EPS as a percentage of the full year will approximate 48% versus 44% in 2015. So let’s move to the summary page. The first quarter was a strong start to the year, with organic growth up 5%, and EPS up 20%. As a result of this strong performance combined with the improved outlooks in the Tools & Storage business, and currency markets, we are raising 2016 guidance for full-year to a range of $6.20 to $6.40 which represents a 5% to 8% increase in the earnings per share versus 2015. As we’ve continued to progress through 2016 our focus remains on the following, driving organic growth across all businesses, and sharing continuous improvement in our operational excellence initiatives, maintaining the momentum behind Security’s margin improvements and as always pushing ourselves to manage our working capital in the most efficient and effective manner possible. That concludes the presentation portion of our call. Now let’s move to Q&A.
Greg Waybright: Thanks, Don. Kylie, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you
Operator: We’ll now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Your line is open.
Jeremie Capron: Thank you, and good morning, gentlemen. Clearly there’s a lot of excitement around new product introductions, I think, Jim, you talked about breakthrough innovation, and we should stay tuned for that hitting in the second half. Can you maybe give us a little more color around that in terms of the scale of those new product launches, and maybe come back to what happened in Q1. Because I think you called out new products as a major reason for the strong performance in Tools & Storage, as well. Thanks.
Jim Loree: Sure. This is Jim. The breakthrough innovation initiative is something that we started really started getting into in the early part of 2014, and the concept behind it is that we do a pretty good job in what we call core innovation, and we did this in both legacy Black & Decker and legacy Stanley, and those are the kind of things that are driving the, you know, the organic – big driver behind the organic growth today and some of the new product introductions that I alluded to in the core innovation area. But those are more things like, in the hand tools business for instance, we introduced a line of FatMax hammers and pry bars and knives and blades, innovative line in one of our large retailers and another large retailer we introduced DEWALT pry bars and pocket knives. And then in professional power tools, compact generation tools DC brushless, some really interesting innovations in the DEWALT Pneumatics line, a Mac impact wrench but you get the idea here. This is sort of the day-to-day innovation that just goes on as a matter of course, but I would say the level of activity in this area, and the freshness of the company’s product lines has never been greater in our recollection. So that goes on, and that drives the kind of growth, the organic growth, along with the commercial excellence initiatives, that you’ve been witnessing now here along with a little help from the U.S. DIY and construction markets. But you can see the growth all over the world. So in Europe which is relatively anemic in terms of its markets we still are growing an average of about 6% to 7% over 2, 2.5 year period. And so there’s something going on there. And it’s really a combination of the core innovation and the commercial excellence. So what is the breakthrough innovation? The breakthrough innovation is a concept where we actually took people out of the mainstream of the core innovation and set them aside, a small group of people, 10 or 15 people in that range, we just said come up with the next major breakthrough innovation for Power Tools. And we gave them a timeframe and we gave them resources, and support. And lo and behold, in a relatively short period of time, they came up with something very, very interesting. What is that? You’ll have to wait and see what that is, but from a scale point of view, we say with the breakthrough innovation – and this is not the only breakthrough innovation team in the company by the way this was just the first one. We have three more in oil and gas. We have one in hydraulics we have – extending one up in engineered fastening but we tell them that whatever you come up with it has to have a scale of at least $100 million of revenue to be interesting to us. So I can’t really get into how big this one could be because frankly we don’t know but we know it’s going to be at least $100 million over time and it could be far, far greater. So that’s – that’s kind of the background and what you have going on now is the commercialization of that. It will begin shortly and you will see it in stores in a relatively short order.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Ken Zener: Good morning, gentlemen.
John Lundgren: Good morning.
Don Allan: Good morning.
Ken Zener: Given the strength you have in, hand tools picking up, could you – in a very strong organic growth that you’re seeing in the U.S., could you kind of talk about how the landscape because since it looks like you’re going to be well over $6 this year. Currency is helping but I mean that was a long-term goal when you did the Black & Decker acquisition. Can you talk about how much that landscape has changed on the Power Tools relative to I don’t want to say it’s third-party competitors but your high margins that you have are obviously a very different business versus 5 years ago. It seems like you’re just gobbling up market share certainly on a dollar basis if not unit basis. Could you just talk about how that’s really structurally changed again given how strong we were this quarter?
Jim Loree: Yes, it’s Jim again. I think what’s really going on here is that the Black & Decker and Stanley integration, the merger of the two companies and the successful integration, was a major home run. I think well beyond anybody’s wildest expectations. I think the cost synergies were just the beginning and we – I think we signed up for $350 million six years ago and we cut off the analysis at about $550 million of cost synergies and there was a huge outperformance. But the thing we never really expected was the revenue synergies that we also beat what we expected to accomplish but they just keep on coming and it has to do with the fact that the cultures gelled so well and got so focused on innovation, commercial excellence, all the kinds of things that I was just talking about, and really put all the BS from the typical integration politics, et cetera behind them, and focused on the customer, focused on the markets. And then the scale that we achieved by putting those two companies together and going to market with Power Tools and Hand Tools, and going to market with all these incredibly strong brands that we have, just gave us tremendous flexibility and we just continued to benefit from that as time goes on.
Don Allan: And I would say a current example of those revenue synergies we touch on here and there is what we’ve been doing in emerging markets where we’ve been rolling out the mid price point products in particularly Power Tools that have the Stanley brand on it. So that’s a great example of continued generation of revenue synergies six years after the merger.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. Specifically just had a question on the security margins as you highlighted a very good first quarter result, best since 2012. Just was curious if you could help out with kind of getting a little more granular in terms of the margin improvement there, off of the revenues down 1%, and perhaps just giving us a sense of perhaps the bigger components of that, also North America versus Europe and how you see that playing out over the next year or two, and perhaps also you can kind of revisit on a more broad basis just the future of the segment overall as you called it out in your Analyst Day as being, the strategic direction being under review, given the solid progress here, how does that affect that? So sorry, a couple of questions but all around the security progress.
John Lundgren: Okay, Mike, this is John, I’ll start. There was I think more than one question there but we’ll try to do the best we can. Let me comment on two things. And then Don will give you a little bit more granularity. As it relates to our assessment of the segment, nothing’s changed. We love this business, and the fact that it continues to grow and margins continue to improve we’ve said on many occasions our single greatest self-help opportunity in terms of margin improvement and earnings growth is restoring security back to its historical levels. We continue that trend and that’s why Jim, expressed the gratification, or encouragement, that that trend’s continued for six consecutive quarters. As you know, margins in Europe in general are lower than the U.S. but the overwhelming majority of the improvement is coming from Europe, albeit from a low base. So we will not forecast margins by sub-segment because, A, it’s very difficult. And B, there’s not much in it for us if we get it right, and a lot of explaining to do if we don’t. But in terms of the assessment of the category itself, we love the business. We review its status with our board every board meeting. That included yesterday and the day before. A year and a half ago, we said in the second half, some time during the second half of 2016, we would be very public in terms of what our plans were. We’re sticking to that and we’re not going to accelerate it. Beyond that, Don, if you want to add a little granularity, please feel free to do so.
Don Allan: Sure. So, when you look at the first quarter performance, Jim mentioned that we are very pleased with the profitability of the segments. And really the improvement that we saw was in all three regions of the world, so the big regions really are North America and Europe where emerging markets is relatively small. And then both – those two large regions we saw really solid improvement year-over-year in the profitability as we continue to execute on the initiatives that we’ve been really discussing almost for two years now of improving field productivity in the electronic security business, in particular in both Europe and in North America. And then in Europe specifically looking at our, SG&A, our selling and general and administrative costs to making sure they’re in line with the revenue of the business as well as the percentage of revenue, we discussed it as a business that probably should be somewhere below 30% of revenue for SG&A and it’s above 30% today so we continue to take actions in those areas to improve the profitability of both businesses, and we’re seeing the benefits of that over the last two or three quarters in particular, as the profitability of the business year-over-year continues to improve. And at this point, based on our guidance for the year, we’re expecting that trend to continue, as we expect modest improvement in profitability of the segment for the full year.
Jim Loree: Mike, and just one other point on the business in general, Jim has talked about it on past calls, but it just shouldn’t go unnoticed. There’s been a lot of organizational changes, where we think – and we’ve been talking about it for a while, but the majority of them have now been in place for about a year, where we think, to use Jim Collins’ often-used term, we think not only we have the right people on the bus, we have them in the right seats on the bus. And it really matters. Everyone knows that, but the fact that we’ve had a stable, capable, tested and proven team, in Europe and in the U.S. supplemented by a couple great new hires in the last six months or so, it’s really, really helped, first of all, stabilize that business, and then ultimately keep both organic growth and margins moving in the direction we want it to.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Brett Linzey: Hi, good morning, this is Brett Linzey on for Jeff. Hey, just want to come back to free cash flow. You guys had a strong working capital quarter and I suspect some of that was inventory drawdown on the industrial side to a line with weaker demand there. But could you just talk about where you guys feel you are relative to that 100% conversion for the year? I mean seemingly there’s a path higher. Is that the case? And is there anything in terms of inventory ahead of this product launch that we should be thinking about?
Don Allan: Sure, this is Don. I’ll take that. As I mentioned, we’re very pleased with the start to the year related to working capital. Part of it was due to the fact that we did have a very strong month of March. And so our inventory levels were brought down in line with that performance which was great to see. And we also were very focused on making sure that we collected the cash throughout the quarter so our accounts receivable was down at the right level, as well. So with our company we’re going to have a cash outflow, as I mentioned, in the first quarter every year, because of the way the Tools & Storage business seasonality impacts the company. But yet we really have to try to minimize that to achieve your objectives for the full year, and I think we’ve done this. This is the best performance we’ve had in Q1 in four years, related to Stanley Black & Decker and so as a result I feel very good about our ability to achieve 100% conversion rate, because we started the year in that regard. Now, your question to potentially additional inventory related to the product launch, yes, we will have some additional inventory. However, based on the current sales plans, as the year progresses, we would expect those inventory levels, vast majority of them, to be absorbed and shipped out to many of our major customers and so we don’t expect that to be a challenge for us as the year ends. But it could be a little bit of additional inventory as we go through the second and the third quarter, which we would normally see anyways in our Tools & Storage business. So at this stage we feel good about our ability to hit our objective of 100%, and we’ll continue to look at that to see how we could potentially outperform that as the year goes on.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Rich Kwas: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Jim Loree: Hi, Rich. Good morning
Don Allan: Good morning.
Rich Kwas: Good I’m going to speak on a couple questions here. John and Jim, just wanted to get your thoughts on the mechanical business in North America so from a growth standpoint that continues to underperform key competitors out there and curious, John your reference to how you got the people in the right spots. Want to get your level of confidence around getting the growth rate up and going there considering the cycles turning in the favor in terms of non-res. And then quick second question Don in terms of the hedging strategies. Thanks for the sensitivity on the various currencies, but last year you went, you got opportunistic when you had a lot of volatility and just curious if we got volatility over the next few months on currencies? Would you take the same approach and just curious around risk as it relates to the updated guidance with currency and your comfort level with that? Thank you.
John Lundgren: Yes, Rich, I’ll take the mechanical piece. I guess in – excuse me – and three bytes, margins are good, growth is below what we had expected to be. To a large extent historically that’s been a product issue where we have been behind our own expectations in some of the market. That being said, our sense is it’s going to be offset by two things. One is the leadership in that business, we believe is quite capable. We have a tested and proven individual who actually came from the DEWALT professional industrial channel. Very, very good person to lead, guide the business and focus on growth as opposed to just margins and things of that nature. So we feel good about it in that perspective. And last but absolutely not least, recall we just really completed and embedded the change to third-party or independent distribution model versus the direct model. And Jim has talked about this often on past calls, years ago we thought that was a distinct competitive advantage, and it was for a time. We made the decision, and I think it was the right one, that what we gain – we lost more than we gained. As a result of that it was a two-year process to, if you will, simply convert our distribution model. That’s behind us it’s beginning to gain traction. So right leader in place, growth-focused executive, and the right distribution model in place, product catching up, gives us cautious optimism that we’ll get that growth back in mechanical because it’s a great opportunity for us.
Jim Loree: And let me just supplement that by saying. So as John described the operational condition of the business is good and getting better and we’re pleased with that. The question that we still have to answer is the one – is the strategic question, and, that we’ll put on hold until we come out in the second half of the year with our Securities portfolio review. So that’s, everything is fair game in security, including mechanical.
Don Allan: Yes and then I’ll touch on your question related to currencies. Clearly we always look at opportunities for hedging when we see shifts in currency and we will continue to do that and we’ve done that again this year. Sensitivities give you an indication of if currencies move in certain directions for the remainder of the year, what the impact could be to our operating margin. And we have thought through it, is there a potential for the $140 million to move back towards $180 million? There’s a scenario where that could play out if the Fed starts talking about potential interest rate increases that could actually result in strengthening of the U.S. dollar and a weakening of some of these currencies. However, we also feel like we’ve built contingency plans to address that scenario if that plays out. So we have certain actions that we would take up to $180 million that we believe would be capable of offsetting that, which is why we felt comfortable making this increase to our guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Tim Wojs: Yes, hey, guys, nice job.
Don Allan: Thank you Tim.
Tim Wojs: I guess just on the Tools business, if we could go back to that for a second. So the full-year guidance is up mid single digits but you’ve got 8% in the first quarter, and then as you go through the year, the comps get a little bit easier in the second half, and you have some new product rollouts. So can you just talk about some of the puts and takes and why maybe we should see decelerating growth in the Tools business this year?
Don Allan: Well I think you might want to think about the first quarter performance and just we’ve mentioned some things about certainly the weather was an additional boost to us in Q1, in particular in North America, as we actually had a mild winter here for the first time in – well a long time for those of us in the northeast. And we benefited a point or two in our Tools & Storage business from that. So if you kind of regulate the growth, saying that’s not going to necessarily repeat itself for the next three quarters, then you’re down to something that’s closer to 6% to 6.5%, roughly. And then we had a fantastic performance in emerging markets in the first quarter, up 9%. We haven’t seen that type of performance in almost 2.5 years. And so we were pleased with that, feel very good about it, but at this stage we’re not necessarily ready to say that’s something that’s going to repeat itself in the next three quarters. We’re clearly focused on trying to maximize that opportunity, but to be able to project that and say for sure that’s going to happen at this stage would probably be a little bit overly optimistic. And those two factors in itself kind of gets you down to a mid single-digit number for the full year, for organic growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David MacGregor: Yes, congrats on a good quarter and all the progress. There’s a lot of data there right now including Bureau of Labor Statistics data just showing a clear shift in the United States of labour from energy and mining into construction. I’m just wondering if you feel this is having a meaningful impact on tool growth and talk about the extent to which you see that as a factor going forward.
Jim Loree: Yes I’ll take it, David. The interest, yes, to quantify it would be very difficult, because it is happening and one of the constraints that we would listen to, some of the homebuilders’ calls as a good example was basically securing enough qualified, capable labor, because so much of it during the financial crisis shifted from construction into energy. As some of that variable labor pool, if I can call it that, shifts back, the answer is absolutely yes. The demand is there, but the qualified capable technically trained or properly trained workers aren’t, it’s going to be a governor on growth. So simply said, yes, it’s having an impact. I think it’s the early stages of that, but that’s clearly helping the North American residential and we think ultimately commercial construction market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Company. Your line is open.
Jeff Kessler: Thank you. You’ve been talking, after the limitation of SFS, you’ve been talking, you mentioned it twice in the first, in your presentation. I’m wondering, and you mentioned that the implication and the actual evidence of that is going to be shown somewhere this year perhaps some time in the second half. Could you be a little more specific as to how we’re going to see SFS come out in the not so much in the numbers, but how it’s going to come out in the operations that you’re showing, which in turn affect the numbers.
Don Allan: Sure, well I talked about the five elements of SFS. We’ll start with the core SFS which is basically the continuation of the SFS that we started in 2006 that got us to 9.2 working capital turns last year and got us customer-facing metrics, we’re very, very strong in relation to competition and make most of our customers very happy. So that core SFS is at the heart of all this and that’s much more of an operations related initiative and it continues to become deeply rooted ten years into its existence. And now what we’re doing with core SFS is we are taking it to another level, largely through digitizing the supply chain, as well as implementing the smart factory across the company. That’s kind of in the early stages, but nonetheless, it is under way. So if we were at nine turns at the end of the year, and we typically generate about 4%, 3% to 4%, productivity, well our cost productivity a year in our factories, and we would expect that to continue on the basis of these investments that we’re making in some of the things that I’m talking about, as well as gradually push that working capital turns number up towards ten and maybe even someday north of ten. So that’s the core SFS. Then there are three elements that are far more growth-oriented, those are the digital excellence, commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation. Talked about breakthrough innovation, I think at length and I think that’s pretty clear. The commercial excellence is really taking some of the continuous improvement concepts that are very familiar to people in business and applying them to the customer-facing processes that drive growth. And so becoming world-class in some of these elements, like sales force effectiveness, like promotion planning, like pricing, pricing excellence, and so on and there’s a number of these areas that when we apply continuous improvement principles to them in multiple facets, they just have an ability to generate tactical share gains, and also margin expansion. So that’s the commercial excellence. And then the digital excellence is one we will also see some really interesting things in the marketplace this year in the second half. They probably won’t be dramatic revenue drivers, but will clearly be – ways to kind of enhance the marketing prowess and depth of penetration in our company, and also just contemporize our value propositions, so that we are again leading the marketplace with technology on the digital front, as well as taking digital and permeating it into the organization for purposes of efficiency and effectiveness. So that’s kind of – those are the various elements. The one I didn’t mention is functional transformation and that’s a very extensive initiative led by our Finance and IT leaders, who are actually taking a clean sheet of paper, after having done 100, almost 100 acquisitions in 12 years, taking a clean sheet of paper and redesigning our processes in Finance, IT, HR, Legal, et cetera, to make sure that they are as efficient as possible. We already believe that they’re quite effective, but we also believe there’s a couple points of G&A that could come out due to increased efficiency when you start with a clean sheet of paper. That’s a long-term initiative. We are not going to see a lot of overnight successes there, but it’s one where we’re making some investments and then over the course of a couple years, we’re really going to start to see that SG&A percent come down as a percent of sales and we’re going to take some of the money that comes out of that and reinvest it in some other growth initiatives.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Mike Dahl: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Say, a question around some of the M&A opportunities that you mentioned at the – in the initial commentary, looking at the bolt-ons in Tools and Industrials. Just curious with all of the market volatility in recent months, what’s your take on how seller expectations have shifted, if at all? What types of sellers are you hearing from? And again if that has changed over the past six months or so, and then just remind us again of kind of what specific areas you think you’re looking to fill some gaps in within Tools. Thanks.
John Lundgren: Yes, sure. This is John. We’re not going to obviously talk specific targets. Never have, never will. And I know you understand and respect that. That being said, I think we’ve been very transparent in terms of where we’re going to grow, where we’re going to acquire. We’re going to continue to consolidate the global Tools & Storage industry, and we really, really like our position and our opportunity to grow our Engineered Fastening business. Having said that, I think importantly our pipeline is quite full and the reason being as you know we’ve been on somewhat of a moratorium, self-imposed for the last 18-plus months. But it doesn’t mean we stop looking at, assessing and in many cases keeping targets warm. So there’s plenty out there in our previously identified areas of strategic focus. In terms of expectations, not a lot has changed. Remember, much of these – many of these are not public companies, number one, but, there are always multiple expectations. But in terms of what’s out there and competition for target, double-edged sword, not too much has changed. Interest rates with obviously very, very low, which would help financial sponsors as they seek to acquire offset by the fact that most financial sponsors and most of the targets that we’re looking at have limited, if any, synergies. So our opportunity to acquire in spaces where we have a great footprint already, arguably the synergies that we could generate would more than offset. I’ll say lack of leverage given our desire insistent tense on maintaining strong tier investment grade rating.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Robert Barry: Hey, guys, good morning.
Don Allan: Good morning.
John Lundgren: Good morning.
Robert Barry: Wanted to actually touch on our follow-up on the strength in emerging market Tools. I think in your comments you referenced some pricing actions related to recouping currency. I was curious, were those materially higher in 1Q? And do you expect them to benefit future periods as well? And if you could also just remind us what the emerging market margins are tracking at in Tools versus in the developed markets. Thanks.
Don Allan: Yes. This is Don. I’ll take your question. Yes, we certainly had a benefit from price in the first quarter, as we communicated early this year back in January. And then we have over the last couple of years as we see these types of movements, we take appropriate price actions where we can to offset that impact at least partially or in some cases close to 100%, and we did do that in the first quarter. And a significant portion of that organic growth we saw was related to price, which is also why, you know, we’re not necessarily thinking this is a business that’s going to grow 9% for the full year, because we are going to see some pricing pressure that I touched on in some of those key markets because of the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus some of those key currencies that just occurred over the last 6 weeks to 8 weeks. So because of that our view is I think prudent, and it’s more reflective of a different pricing market because of the currency shift. You asked about profitability margins in emerging markets for Tools. That’s slightly below line average at this point for our Tools & Storage business, but it’s an area as we continue to ramp up some of the mid-price point initiatives and we continue to grow with the markets and outpace them, most likely 1.5 to 2.5 times GDP growth, that we expect with the leverage opportunity that it will get very close to line average.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is open.
Liam Burke: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. John, on the online strategy you have, especially in North America, are any brands doing particularly better or more geared towards online rather than your traditional distribution channels?
John Lundgren: Yes, I think you almost answered the question, as you asked it. Brands do well online, and with the two different groups or via e-commerce. The Black & Decker brand for DIY users is extremely popular, both DIY Power Tools, outdoor products, et cetera, but a real driver is DEWALT. It’s the brand the pros go to. It’s available, it’s available online, and we’re very thoughtful in terms of the extent to which we promote it, make it available, push it, because prior to the Stanley Black & Decker merger, DEWALT actually, other than via a retailer’s own online opportunity, DEWALT wasn’t offered online. It is now. It’s doing well. But think of our three power brands, Stanley, DEWALT, Black & Decker, their specific end-user groups and to each and every one, they’re all doing encouragingly well. The biggest single dollar percentage, though, would be DEWALT.
Jim Loree: It’s Jim. I’d also just add that very interestingly a couple years ago we did a complete refresh of the Black & Decker brand, and it had really gotten a little bit stale and it had lost a bit of its identity. And when we did the refresh, we tried to bring a millennial sort of focused element to it, and we added some lifestyle elements related to the millennial population, as well as the ECOSMART aspects, which is the sustainability of some of the products and packaging, and so on. And the Black & Decker brand has really made a lot of progress with the millennial population. It is definitely not your father’s Oldsmobile. It’s gone from sort of the mature demographic to the up and coming, so even though it’s not the dollar leader in terms of what we sell in e-commerce, it is, for the medium to long-term, has tremendous potential as the generational shift continues.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman. Your line is open.
Dennis McGill: Hi. Good morning, thank you. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on down on the Security outlook where you’re looking for the organic growth slide, the single-digit. The 3% to 4% in Europe seems to be pretty sustainable and consistent with what you guys have done, I assume that’s sort of baked into the outlook. So from the North American side, how do you think about the potential through the year going from the modest declines so far as you progress through the year and the end channel opportunity in general? Are you optimistic that the non-res market is accelerating? Is it more just self-driven to close the gap with the non-res market? Just curious how you’re thinking about that.
Don Allan: Sure. I think as the year progresses, and you’re right about Europe, I would imagine it would continue on this 3% trajectory we’ve been seeing for the rest of the year. I think North America, we will see a positive performance in our mechanical businesses in the low single-digits. And then our convergent business continues to be focused on a lot of different activities. And as a result, I do think that they’re behind the market pace a little bit, but as the year goes on, that will continue to improve, but we’ll probably see a little bit of pressure in the organic growth throughout the year. And then the last thing I’d mention is we will continue to see emerging market pressure within Security for organic growth. We definitely experienced that in Q1 although it’s a small part of the total business, I do think that will be a bit of a pressure point, as well.
Operator: Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Waybright for closing remarks.
Greg Waybright: Kylie, thanks a lot. We’d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. And obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating on today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Operator: Welcome to the Q4 and Full Year 2015 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Stephanie, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.
Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations: Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Conference Call. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, our President and COO and Don Allan our Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning John, Jim, and Don will review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and our 2016 outlook followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in the most recent 1934 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Today we're going to spend just a few minutes reviewing a solid operational fourth quarter that wrapped up a really strong year before we discuss this year's guidance, and then of course take your questions. First for the year, organic growth was up 6% with Tools & Storage leading the way, up 8%. Security was flat while Industrial delivered 2%. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 14.2% which is a post-merger record for the company. EPS of $5.92 was a 10% improvement versus 2014. Jim's going to provide a lot more detail particularly on the margins and growth by segment when he gets into the segment reviews. Free cash flow came in at $871 million on strong working capital turns of 9.2 times. And in line with our previous commitments, we executed over $1 billion of share repurchase actions in 2015, wrapping up a really strong year in which we overcame numerous challenges not the least of which was foreign currency. Guidance for 2016 is being established with an EPS range of $6 to $6.20 a share or a midpoint EPS growth of approximately 3% versus 2015. Don's going to take you through this in more detail later in the call. Moving to the right on the chart for the quarter, revenue expanded 1% organically with total growth down 5% as the top line impact of foreign currency was negative 6% for the quarter. There was a fiscal calendar phenomenon in the fourth quarter that did have a modest negative impact on organic growth that Don's going to address more in detail when he walks through the quarter, but I think it's an important point. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 14.2% which was in 100 basis point improvement ahead of the fourth quarter 2014. Our margins increased due to continued sharp focus on price realization and some commodity deflation delivering operating leverage despite $50 million from foreign currency pressure in the quarter. EPS with $1.78 was up 30% versus fourth quarter 2014 as the solid operational performance combined with lower tax, share count, and some restructuring less than the prior quarter offset the foreign exchange. Turning to slide five and an overview of the sources of growth for the quarter. As previously mentioned, organic growth remained positive due to the continued strength of Tools & Storage, particularly in the U.S. and the European residential and nonresidential construction markets, and the Stanley Engineered Fastening automotive business, which offset pressure in the Industrial channel, lower emerging market volumes and customer specific volume declines within the Stanley Engineered Fastening electronics business. This growth was offset by foreign exchange headwinds of 6% in the quarter, resulting in total revenue down 5% as previously mentioned. Looking at it geographically, Europe led the way, up 3%, as share gains continued in the region and nearly every market contributed positive growth. The U.S. generated 1% organic growth while solid Construction POS performance has left customer inventories in good shape as we enter 2016. Emerging markets in the rest of the world began to show signs of macro pressure to the top line, contracting 2% and 3% respectively. There was, as always, significant variation among the countries, but China, Russia, and Venezuela showed the largest year-on-year declines. And quickly for the year, organic growth was 6%, 5% volume, 1% price. This growth was offset by 7% currency, netting down to a 1% decline in total revenue, as shown in the box on the left of the chart. We were pleased that geographically the organic growth was shared around the world, spread fairly evenly of course with the U.S. leading the way at plus 8%, Europe plus 4%, emerging markets plus 3%, and the rest of the world plus 3%. Let me turn it over to Jim to get into some more operating detail on our three segments.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Okay. Thanks, John. I'll start with Tools & Storage, which wrapped up a banner year with solid fourth quarter performance despite difficult comps, mixed end markets, and a relentless dollar strengthening. Tools benefited from strong execution momentum in all areas: new products, supply chain, and commercial excellence. As for markets, continued strength in U.S. Construction, DIY, and Consumer was a help. However, emerging market and overall Industrial conditions were more than challenging. European tool end markets continued to be flat to slightly positive, and continuing U.S. dollar strengthening, especially against Latin American currencies, presented familiar but increasingly large headwinds for both revenues and operating margin. Organic growth for the segment was 3% in the quarter, with all regions once again contributing. Europe led the way up 6% followed by North America and emerging markets contributing 3% and 1% respectively. Although revenues were down 3% due to a 6 point currency impact, operating margin was up 1% with a 60 basis point year-over-year improvement in the rate. Execution of price, productivity, and cost control initiatives, along with a little help from lower commodity prices, enabled us to more than offset the onslaught from currency pressure. And across the global product lines, Power Tools posted 5% organic growth with contributions from Professional Power Tools up 7%, Consumer Power Tools up 3%, and Accessories up 2%. Our Hand Tools & Storage business was down 2% as strength within Construction Tools and our Mac mobile distribution business was offset by significantly lower sales within the Industrial channels. Innovation continues to generate solid growth across the business with ongoing contributions from DC brushless power tools as well as new product rollouts such as the DEWALT 20-volt and DEWALT 40-volt Outdoor, Stanley FatMax power tools in Europe, and DEWALT Pneumatics. Within North America retail POS performance was again strong in the quarter, wrapping up a record year which saw positive POS in 50 of 52 weeks, growth across every SBU and as impressively across all major brands – Black & Decker, DEWALT, Stanley, and BOSTITCH. Importantly, retail inventories remain at healthy and appropriate levels consistent with prior year. And in addition, the team continues to drive out-performance in Mac Tools, which closed the quarter with growth in high single digits, delivering its sixth consecutive year and 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. And finally, we continued to enjoy robust growth in e-commerce, this time highlighted by success with our rebranded and very innovative Black & Decker consumer products. Europe continues to perform at multiples above the underlying market, posting 6% organic growth in the quarter for a full year total of 7%. This region has shown remarkably consistent share gains in a relatively flat market, delivering approximately 7% organic growth across much of the past three years. Importantly, the growth in Europe continues to be wide-spread across nearly all regions as consistent share gains validate the success of our innovation and commercial excellence initiatives. The emerging market team once again overcame significant market headwinds generating 1% organic growth in the quarter, with contributions from Argentina, Mexico, and Turkey more than offsetting continued pressures in Russia, China, Brazil, and other parts of South America. And meanwhile the timely global release of the Stanley power tools line for emerging markets continues to gain traction in the large and growing mid-price point segment helping to offset regional economic and geopolitical market turbulence. The fourth quarter caps off an exceptional year by our Tools & Storage team, 8% organic growth for the year against a 6% 2014 comp with an operating margin rate up 110 basis points, executing on all fronts, taking share, improving profitability in the face of a volatile backdrop. And at the same time, the team very methodically and successfully positioned the business for more growth ahead. In that regard, we see continued robust growth for Tools in 2016. Our innovation pipeline is stronger than any time since the merger, and our supply chain and commercial teams are operating at very high fitness levels with the SFS 2.0 firmly embedded in our operating culture. These are exciting times for Tools & Storage and we expect the performance level to continue to be very high as we go forward. Turning to Security, progress continued across our Security business with Europe advancing on all fronts and North America showing steady progress in its transformation efforts. Within Europe, the business was up 3% organically, the fifth consecutive quarter in positive territory. Commercial wins were widespread across most countries as we recognized benefits from investments in our regional sales organizations. Profitability continued to improve sequentially and versus prior year with a fourth quarter operating margin rate approaching 10%. Solid order intake and a healthy backlog both up double digits year-over-year combined with stable attrition rates within our targeted range leave us well positioned to continue forward momentum into 2016. While organic revenues were down within North America due principally to a large installation in last year's fourth quarter, the team posted sequential margin expansion due to improved field productivity within the commercial electronics security business as the benefits from the Stanley standard operational improvement initiative began to take hold. Strong orders, a healthy backlog and a growing RMR portfolio position this business well as we head into 2016. Emerging markets were again a modest drag on Security growth and profitability as weak market conditions in China continued. But overall for this segment, profitability was up 100 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially, a solid indicator that our transformation efforts are taking hold within the organization. Turning to Industrial. Industrial saw a 1% organic decline in the quarter as lower volumes in Engineered Fastenings, Electronics and Industrial businesses more than offset strong global automotive revenue and organic growth in our oil and gas business. Operating profit was up 5% with a 210 basis point improvement in the margin rate as productivity gains and cost controls were able to counteract lower volume. Engineered Fastening's 3% organic decline was attributable to weakening within the Industrial channel and lower sales volume in the electronics space as our largest consumer electronics customer unexpectedly reduced production levels on their recently launched smartphone. This more than offset another quarter in which our automotive revenues outpaced light vehicle production. The business was able to anticipate some of the Industrial market's softness and thus benefited from proactive cost actions taken within the quarter. Infrastructure delivered positive organic growth of 2% as oil and gas grew 17% organically, propelled by increased project activity in the North America onshore market more than offsetting declines in hydraulics, which continues to be impacted by depressed scrap steel prices. All in all, an impressive operational performance was registered by the Industrial teams, expanding profitability and margin rates in the face of a choppy and mostly inhospitable end market environment with the exception of auto production. In summary, for the total company, the fourth quarter represented a solid performance wrapping up a tremendous year which included organic growth of 6%, record operating margins, and record EPS. This performance highlights our team's agility, passion to perform, and ability to be proactive and responsive to market condition, balancing investments for growth and taking out costs when necessary, strengths that will serve us well as we head into 2016. As we consider the 2016 outlook, which Don will share with you in a few minutes, our ability to generate outsized organic growth albeit at a slower pace than in the preceding two years will be enabled by the investments we have made and are making in SFS 2.0, which is our transformational business operating system. In early 2015, we launched the next generation of SFS, creating a more powerful mechanism to enable sustained above-market organic growth and margin expansion with high asset efficiency. The expanded SFS 2.0 is transforming the company by focusing our activities in five key areas: digital excellence, breakthrough innovation, commercial excellence, functional transformation, and core SFS. I would encourage serious long-term investors to develop a deep understanding of SFS 2.0 in that this is not an investor relations marketing jargon but rather a carefully constructed and executed framework that enables our organization to extract maximum value out of our world class franchises. We do this through capital efficient organic growth and continuous margin expansion. You have already seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in the organic growth and margin expansion in Tools & Storage and other parts of the company. In 2016, you will see a growing impact from breakthrough innovation, digital, as well as the other elements of the initiative which is now in its second year and gaining momentum. I would also say that we are once again open for business when it comes to inorganic growth. We look forward to supplementing our organic growth with a disciplined approach to M&A that we have deployed during almost 100 hundred acquisitions over the past 15 years, a period of time when we more than quadrupled our revenues and market cap and outperformed the S&P 500's total shareholder return by five times. With that, I'll turn it over to Don Allan.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Jim. Let's begin with our fourth quarter and full year free cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $697 million, up almost $50 million from the prior year, resulting in $871 million of free cash flow for the full year. This full-year result is approximately $50 million to $75 million lower than we anticipated going into the quarter and is the result of lower than expected fourth quarter volumes in Tools & Storage and Engineered Fastening, which in turn, resulted in lower working capital liquidation. Nonetheless, working capital turns finished the year at 9.2 times, flat to the prior year, but at a level that many industrials would envy. Overall, our cash flow performance remains strong, a 96% conversion rate for the full year and our leveraged metrics are in line with our year-end expectations. One additional comment on free cash flow as it relates to the other line. As you can see, we experienced approximately $120 million variance versus the prior year in the fourth quarter. This variance was planned and is due primarily to discontinued operation activity in the fourth quarter of 2014 combined with the timing of certain derivative settlements and tax payments. So, let's turn to page 11. I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwind. Certainly, it won't be news to anyone that the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against the vast majority of currencies around the world. This strong dollar has resulted in approximately a 50% increase against the Brazilian real since the beginning of 2015. Also, the British pound, and the Australian dollar are at levels we have not seen since the 2008 credit crisis, and the Canadian dollar has not been this weak versus the U.S. dollar for well over a decade. And last but certainly not least, the Argentinean peso, which essentially has been on a constant decline since the government's default back in 2001, accelerated its correction with a 30% cliff devaluation in December, resulting in another meaningful headwind for us in 2016. The effect of all these moves is that we are facing another significant foreign exchange headwind in 2016 which, at current spot rates, results in a year-over-year impact to operating margin between $170 million and $190 million. This impact is a combination of transactional and translational. However, approximately two-thirds of the 2016 headwind will be transactional, pressuring our margins, while approximately one-third will be translational. The transactional amount is substantially higher than prior year, as we feel the impact of the 2015 derivative hedges expiring in 2016, and this is approximately $60 million of our total currency headwinds. This 2016 currency impact is on top of over $300 million in currency headwinds we faced over the past two years, where our teams focused on significant operational actions which more than offset these pressures in 2014 and 2015. However, given the magnitude of these continued headwinds, we will not be able to completely offset currency in 2016 with price and cost actions. That being said, we will offset approximately 50% of this $170 million to $190 million headwind within 2016. And as we have previously discussed, over the long-term, we will continue to identify opportunities to localize production to help mitigate currency as well as improve the efficiency of our global supply chain. So, let's transition to our 2016 outlook on the next page. As John mentioned, we are guiding to an EPS range of $6 to $6.20 or a midpoint EPS growth of approximately 3%. Let's walk through some of the key drivers in our guide. First, we expect organic growth to approximate 3%, which will contribute $0.45 to $0.50 EPS for the year. As Jim discussed, SFS 2.0 will help fuel this growth in 2016 and beyond. We expect our Tools & Storage business to continue to take market share in most regions. Our innovation pipeline is robust and we believe this business can leverage that to grow in the low to mid-single digits in the face of challenging global macroeconomic environment. We expect progress to continue within the Security platform resulting in low single-digit growth, and we also expect Industrial to have low single-digit growth as the Engineered Fastening and Automotive business will continue to demonstrate strong growth, while the remainder of the segment faces pressures across several end markets including oil and gas, scrap steel, general industrial, and electronic. One additional point related to organic growth before I move on to the next topic. It's worth noting that when normalizing for a 53-week activity, which was included in the 2014's fourth quarter, which is a fiscal calendar phenomena that occurs every seven years. If you adjust for that, the total company's organic growth would have actually been 1.5 to 2 points higher or approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015. This is notable when you consider the fact of 1% organic growth and us guiding to 3% organic growth in 2016. We believe, this, along with the strength of certain markets we operate in, namely U.S. construction, along with global automotive production, combined with our focus in SFS 2.0 gives us confidence in our ability to achieve 3% organic growth outlook for 2016. Continuing to the next EPS driver, you will see another $0.45 to $0.50 of earnings improvement from additional cost and productivity initiatives. We have a solid amount of carryover commodity deflation materializing in 2016 and the business teams have worked hard to identify additional cost reduction opportunities which on top of our normal productivity gains will result in a solid contribution to the bottom line. Also, we see an additional increase to EPS of approximately $0.13 from a lower share base due to the carryover benefit of our 2015 share actions as well as opportunistic buybacks particularly if we continue to see depressed share prices. Working against all of these strong operational actions will be the previously-mentioned foreign exchange headwind which results in approximately $0.85 to $0.95 of EPS pressure year-over-year. Because of the severity of this transactional currency headwind and its impact on margins, we expect the company-wide operating margin in 2016 to be relatively flat year-over-year. To put this in perspective, we estimate that the FX headwinds net of benefits we are receiving from lower commodity costs as well as pricing activities will cause us to lose 60 basis points to 75 basis points of margin rate improvement in 2016. Our three-year financial vision presented at the May 2015 Investor Meeting contemplated a 50 basis points to 75 basis points of margin improvement each year, which assumes a stable foreign exchange environment. So, we believe we're continuing to perform in line with that objective, albeit with our improvements offsetting FX rather than resulting in OM rate expansion that we like to see. A few other items to mention related to guidance are: we expect our restructuring charges and tax rate to be relatively flat to the prior year, and then finally, as we look to the first quarter, we expect our first quarter EPS percentage of the full year EPS to be approximately 18.5%, which is very close to the prior two years' average. Moving to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, I've already touched on most of the drivers behind our organic growth so I'll spend a minute on margin rate expectations. We expect Tools & Storage margin to be relatively flat year-over-year and that is primarily the result of the FX dynamic I described earlier netting against the really impressive operating leverage this business continues to achieve. We expect Security margins to continue to improve modestly versus prior year reflecting benefits from further progress in field productivity, our commercial investments, and the realignment of the cost structure of the business to help drive profitable future growth; another good step forward, as anticipated. Industrial margins are expected to be relatively flat, as productivity gains in cost takeouts particularly within the Engineered Fastening business are expected to offset top line pressure I previously discussed related to key portions of this segment. Before moving on to the summary of this morning's call, I would like to discuss the potential for a recessionary environment and make a few comments on what actions we would take if, and I emphasize if, we are faced with deteriorating economic conditions. At this stage, we believe a U.S. recession is low probability in 2016. However, we have established contingency plans to ensure we are adequately prepared. If we were faced with this type of an environment consistent with our behavior in past similar circumstances, we would execute mitigation plans and they would take the form of head count reductions, investment delays, and further discretionary spending reductions. Specifically, if the environment resulted in us experiencing a flat organic revenue performance versus our current view of 3% growth, we would take cost actions to hold EPS relatively close to our guidance range. Clearly, if a more severe environment were to occur, which appears unlikely at this stage, we would focus on protecting our earnings base as much as possible, similar to the approach we took in 2009. Now, moving on to the summary page. We are very pleased with the business' performance in 2015. We witnessed strong operational execution to overcome a host of external challenges including $220 million of foreign exchange headwinds, which delivered ultimately organic growth of 6% at the top end of our targeted range; a record operating margin rate of 14.2%, which was up 90 basis points versus the prior year; and of course, double-digit EPS growth. We are also encouraged with the progress in our Security business, particularly Security Europe, which really made meaningful improvements on all fronts. As we look to 2016, we are focused on positioning the company to manage through another year of turbulent markets and severe foreign exchange headwinds. As such, we remain committed to our core objectives: maintaining our focus on organic growth through both continued innovation and commercial excellence; ensuring progress within the Security segment to maintain the momentum we saw in 2015; of course, executing on additional cost and pricing actions to help partially offset our FX headwinds; and also being prepared to take further actions as conditions warrant; as always, maintaining our perpetual focus on working capital management and improving that as we move forward; and importantly, leveraging the pillars of SFS 2.0; and to continue driving momentum in 2016 and beyond. That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Now, we move to Q&A.
Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations: Don, thanks. Stephanie, we can now open the call to Q&A please.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just one question in line with the rules. Obviously, the Tools & Storage performance in 2015 was exceptional. A big part of that was SFS 2.0 and the innovation pipeline. I'm just wondering how does the NPI look for 2016? And maybe just comment on the share gains in Europe; any categories to call out there?
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure. It's Jim. The innovation pipeline for Tools & Storage is as robust as it has been at any time since the merger. And what we've been focusing on, if you rewind to 2010 when we put the companies together, there was a lithium-ion problem, they were losing share, we inherited that. Fortunately, they had done a fair amount of corrective action that began to manifest itself shortly after the merger and we started regaining share. And then we, after a year or two of that, really came out strong with the DC brushless, a complete redesign of the DC brushless products. And that became the fastest-growing segment of cordless, and we were growing at about 2x and still are growing at a very rapid rate vis-à-vis competition. And then at the same time, there was a lot of, call it, incremental innovation going on in Hand Tools & Storage in revitalization of the Black & Decker brand and product lines, the Consumer Products and accessories as well. So there's been a lot of, I'd call it, broad-based but relatively small-scale innovation in addition to the lithium-ion gains and then the DC brushless gains. So that's all really what's driven the NPI, that's driven some of the growth here in addition to the commercial excellence that you referred to. Now, what's coming is something more on the order of breakthrough innovation, which is the real SFS 2.0. And without getting into the details of exactly what it is, I think if you stay tuned during 2016, you will start to see some pretty interesting innovation that would be more in the category of breakthrough. And in addition to that, we will continue on with the incremental type innovation and the DC brushless and the continuing progress in lithium-ion. So, it really is a step function increase in innovation that is occurring in the Tools business, and you'll start to see the manifestation of that I think in the second half of the year. As far as Europe, there's a number of things going on in Europe relative to the Black & Decker products, the Consumer business, the brushless, which is a big deal over there, and a number of other things. But I'd say Europe is a combination to the NPI plus just the tremendous thrust into commercial excellence, which, as we've described it or as we describe it, involves a multi-pronged attack into the seven pillars, if you will, of customer-facing processes, which include gaining customer insights, driving innovation, driving brand awareness, being excellent at pricing and promotion, deploying the sales force properly, doing channel and partner programs that are very aggressive and successful, and then finally providing outstanding customer sales and post-sales support. And it's a focus on all those various processes. When you put them all together, that's what's really driving the growth in Europe. And I'd say on top of that, you have what I'd call second order revenue synergies from the Black & Decker merger that are even today manifesting themselves in further growth, customer white space, distribution channel white space, those types of things, brand white space are all helping drive the European growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC: Good morning. Hey, in terms of Tools & Storage, the outlook for U.S. construction still positive. Maybe there and just for the broader company that we're getting this offset now from Industrial, can you sort of frame and provide a little more color on the magnitude of the drop-off you saw there in 4Q and what are your expectations for the drag from Industrial in 2016?
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Shannon, this is John. Industrial markets are slowing down. That's the bad news. The good news is, it represents about 20% of our total business, 25% I guess with Industrial Hand Tools within Tools & Storage. But if I can kind of address, I'll say, the elephant in the room, you're very polite or diplomatic about it, but I think I can answer your question quite helpfully. We strive to grow at two times the rate of the market in our Tools & Storage business over the long term. And we've met or exceeded that objective over the past two years, as Jim just described, as the SFS 2.0 growth initiative started to gain traction. And this being said, I don't think it's realistic to plan such outsized growth each and every quarter from any global diversified industrial. So in the fourth quarter, organic growth was lower than we planned, but the shortfall was in areas you'd expect, and a lot of information from Jim and Don, but to try to summarize it, we did have lower industrial channel volumes in Tools & Storage and Stanley Engineered Fastening. That was a full point of organic growth relative to our expectations, and that's globally across the company. Another full point was lower customer-specific volumes and it's been well in the public domain from a large Consumer electronics customer for our Stanley Engineered Fastening business again within the Industrial segment. But that contributed almost a full point of slower organic growth than our expectations. Something that's not directly related to Industrial channels, emerging markets' softness, if you will, contributed about a point. So, relative to the 1% reported, that's about 300 more basis points. And then lastly, Don talked about the fiscal calendar phenomenon, which was another 100 basis points to 200 basis points. So, looking at it all that way, I think it's fairly straightforward. Without question, the biggest headwind being industrial markets in general and those markets in the U.S., in particular, because they've been so strong. Conversely, as Jim just talked about, Tools & Storage in the U.S., up mid- single digits; Europe, up 6%. But that's driven by construction in retail, even e-commerce, which was way up. Automotive is still strong. We grew 6% in the fourth quarter, which is well above the rate of light vehicle production. And Security Europe, our investments are paying off. It was up 3%. So, I think your question is spot on. Our biggest headwind on organic growth, obviously, that has nothing to do with FX, are the industrial markets. They represent 20% to 30% of our business. And if they're flat, we think – the markets are flat, we think that's probably as well as they're going to do. And I think you can do the math from there. So, I hope that helps.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: And if I could just offer a little additional insight on the Industrial. It's an interesting situation, because you have very much a sector-specific series of issues with agriculture, mining, and oil and gas or energy. So there's a capital – a CapEx kind of contraction going on in those industries. And it's sort of spilled over to affect the overall MRO market as well. And then you have industrial markets such as automotive that are more driven by Consumer demand, and those are relatively healthy. So, within Industrial, you have a dichotomy of markets that are flat out on their back, and then you have other healthy markets. And fortunately for us, a good portion of our Industrial exposure happens to be in the automotive. And if that holds up, that will be a very good thing. And we'll just see what – how long it takes for this ag, mining, and energy, those segments to kind of play out and trough out. And then, at that point, I think we'll be back in good stead with Industrial.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Matt A. Bouley - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. This is Matt, on for Mike. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on the Engineered Fastening business. Wanted to get your thoughts on the customer challenges you mentioned just on the electronics side, specifically. So, how you may be addressing that, how you think that dynamic plays out in 2016, and how that is embedded in your organic guidance.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Don will give you exactly how it's embedded in organic guidance, because it's pretty much arithmetic. But as you would expect, it's a large customer. We don't – we just have a policy not to mention customers names on our call. But I think it's quite clear who it is, and that's their choosing, not ours. That being said, strategically, it's to diversify our customer base just as we've done over the years in global Tools & Storage, where there was a point in time where the two largest North American big box retailers represented 40% of our business. Today, they're huge customers but they represent about half that amount. The same thing with Engineered Fastening, and then will turn it over to Don. Less than three years ago, OEM automotive was more than 70% of the business. So, it was a conscious decision to diversify the verticals we serve, particularly with a focus on electronics, to a lesser extent, aerospace. And we've done that and it's been pretty successful. So, we've had tremendous growth and then a step back relative to one customer's end market product sales being down. Simply said, within Consumer electronics, we need to diversify our customer base. We think we have as good a product offering as anyone to accomplish that. Of course, it doesn't happen overnight. And then continue the strategic push, as Jim and the business leaders talked about in May, to serve more verticals. But Don can talk to you about the specifics of the one issue in Consumer electronics as it relates to our guide.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. So, our electronics business within Engineered Fastening, as John mentioned, was down substantially in the fourth quarter. They had about an impact of a full point across the entire company, which equates to about $25 million of revenue. And that was a percentage decline versus prior year of close to 30%, 40% with that particular piece of the Engineered Fastening business. We expect that type of pressure to continue into 2016, and we formulated that into our guidance. And that's clearly one of the pressure points that we are anticipating and it's a headwind against the organic growth of 3%. And so, it's one the reasons why the organic growth is at that number versus maybe original expectation, closer to 4%
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Timothy R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess my question is just on construction. Curious what you're seeing in the market and kind of what you're embedding around non-res and residential construction in 2016.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: I'll take that one. So, we obviously have a view that's positive related to construction overall and we think that is an appropriate perspective for 2016 at this stage. And when you look at point of sale information from some of our major customers, we're seeing rates that – we ended the year with very strong growth rates and what we're seeing and expect that to continue here in 2016. As far as the break between resi and non-res, I think the non-res market continues to show a little bit of life. We watch that closely in a portion of our Security business, in particular, our mechanical lock business is a good indicator of that. That business is demonstrating kind of mid- to high single-digit organic growth over the last year. We expect that type of trend to continue. So, we're not looking for a dramatic increase in that space, but it's a relatively small part of our company, roughly $250 million, 300 million of revenue annualized but it's a good indicator of the non-resi market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Hey, I want to come back to currency more from a strategic standpoint if you can kind of address kind of the question. Looking at what's going on, obviously, there could be a debate on whether this is now just a cyclical phenomenon or a secular phenomenon. And I just wonder where you stand on that. And really the essence of my question is if you believe it's more secular, what does the investment look like to further reposition the footprint of the company geographically to respond to that on a longer-term basis?
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I'll start, Jeff. You used the caveat, if you believe it's secular, and I'm not sure we do. We could have a long debate about it. But even if it – we're going to do the same thing irrespective of cyclical. On cyclical, Jim, Don and I have been doing this a long time. You want to talk about the euro; everybody worries about it being on parity. I've done business when it was at $0.85 and we've seen it approach $1.50. That's fairly cyclical. Irrespective whether it's cyclical or secular, what we can do the most, I think two things. We're not going to double down where the risks are high, but we're also not going to walk away from our investments. We're going to stay positioned particularly in emerging markets and 50% of our revenue is outside the U.S. in those markets which will continue to grow albeit slower from a lower base to be in a position to leverage our share and leverage our volume when and if it turns around. But the biggest thing affecting us and I think Don touched on it, we always talk about both translational and transactional. And as the transactional aspect grows to more than 50% of our foreign exchange headwind, what we're working very hard to do is move production and sourcing locally. We have a goal to produce 50% or more of what we do in countries where we sell it. And if you take that to the next step, obviously, everyone knows you can't build a plant overnight nor would you want to nor would you want to put bricks and mortar down if you believe it's secular. But what we can do is a much better job and we're working hard at it, qualifying local both raw materials and more important critical component suppliers. And if you're working in an emerging market, as I think you're aware, many of our components that are critical to quality are either U.S.-based or U.S.-produced or dollar-denominated. To the extent we can qualify local suppliers, protect our IP but produce those critical components locally to be processed locally, that's going to be a tremendous offset or hedge. Don may want to add something to that.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I think that particular point, what John said is exactly correct. However, the reality is that at this stage in certain parts of the world, Canada and Brazil being the best example, there's not a great deal of suppliers that are available that we can do that with. So, that's something that we have to think about, is there an Asian company that we're currently working with that would – they could create a plant within Brazil and allow us to have a supplier locally, that is transacting locally. Those are all things that take time. These are not necessarily things that happen overnight. In the meantime, we're doing things as much as we can that make economic sense over the short-term and the long-term. But I think we do view this as very much a cyclical shift, and if that view changes over time, then obviously, our view of where we manufacture will have to shift as well. Because if you look at the history of Stanley and of course the history of Black & Decker separately, they're both known for pursuing the lowest cost possible and also maintaining the highest quality. And that's not going to change. So as dynamics shift in the markets around the world and costs shift with it, we have to be flexible and agile and make sure that we're doing the right thing from a supply chain perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Two quick questions; one, John, what are your thoughts about asset prices now for potential acquisitions in terms of what you're seeing out there given some of the broader weakness in the global economies? And then second question, on Industrial margin, I think calling for relatively flat, Don, does that assume – how much of a decline does that assume in electronics? It sounds like you're assuming a pretty steep decline year-over-year within the guide. But I just want to get the puts and takes and the risks to upside or downside to the Industrial outlook for margin. Thanks.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'll take the asset price. They're becoming more reasonable just as is Stanley Black & Decker. As I think Jim could not have been more clear in his pitch, Rich, that we are open for business in terms of growing this company by a thoughtful strategic acquisition that meets both our strategic goals and our financial hurdles as well as fits within our organizational capacity. And I'll simply say, as multiples come down, I think, and valuations come down, there's more out there that could be attractive to us both domestically and outside the U.S. I don't think – there's so many bargains out there as we speak that we need to rush to buy something because it's never going to be at a lower price. But our view is always to buy good companies at a fair price. We've had a hard time meeting or exceeding valuation expectations in the last six months, but we see that – we see it, I think, as you might expect coming more into line, which is that and the fact that we think we have our Security business on the right track, which is why Jim made the point in his piece of the presentation. We are open for business, looking at assets in the three strategic areas that we've previously identified.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: And, Rich, on the Industrial question related to margins, certainly the impact from the electronics business within Engineered Fastening is pressuring margins as we expect significant top line pressure there. We also, within that business, within Engineered Fastening, we have a kind of a general industrial sector that's about at $0.5 billion in revenue on an annualized basis that has been feeling pressure as well similar to the Industrial Tool business within Tools & Storage. For example, in the fourth quarter, that business was down approximately 10%. And we expect that to continue at least into the first half. So those two things are definitely putting pressure on the top line and the margins. Now, offsetting that and going in the opposite direction is what Jim and both John had mentioned about the automotive production business within Engineered Fastening is offsetting that. We expect growth probably in the mid-single digits again within that business in 2016. And we also have cost actions and various other productivity actions we're taking across Engineered Fastening to make sure that the margins are flat and hopefully a little bit better than that as the year goes on. And then the two smaller pieces of Industrial, which is the oil and gas business and the hydraulic tool business, the combination that we call Infrastructure, we expect those to be relatively flat on the top line, maybe down slightly, and then margins flat as well as those markets are pretty slow at this stage. But we think we've gotten through the difficult comps as we go into 2016.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hi, guys. Good morning.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what's assumed for price in the outlook? And specifically, perhaps if you could unpack some of the moving pieces say price to offset currency, price to get paid for all the innovation versus maybe having to share some of the commodity deflation with the bigger customers. Thanks.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Fair question. Fairly complex to say the least.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I'm not sure I can give all that level of granularity for a variety of reasons, but I will give you a little bit of color on this area. We do expect a modest positive in price in 2016, and there's really a makeup within that number. We do see more positive price in emerging market actions. So as we deal with this currency pressure, in particular in Brazil and some of the other Latin countries, but then also in Canada as well, which is obviously not an emerging market, we expect some price increase there. So those are positives. Some of the negatives, we will see a little bit of price pressure in different parts of the mature markets, because we have dealt with some significant commodity deflation; that's been a benefit to us. We don't expect that to be significant, but those are very kind of surgical strategic decisions that our Tools & Storage team is very savvy at managing and working through as part of the overall offering to our customers.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I guess I'll just add to that. I think it is important because the very end of your question was more than fair in terms of getting paid for the innovation. We have a history of, if you will, protecting price or being paid by innovation just for that reason. Specifically, to bring the same product or a minor modest incremental improvement to a customer, even in a flat commodity situation and expect the price increases unrealistic to say the least. Real prices have been declining 2% to 3% a year or 1% to 2% a year for the last 10 years, real prices. So the way to protect price, I think it's probably more important in understanding why Don has confidence that overall we'll see some modest price, is to bring in some cases meaningful incremental but meaningful and in other cases, to Jim's point, breakthrough innovation to the customers. If no one else has it, you can charge whatever – you can value price and charge what you believe is appropriate for it. So it's far easier to bring a product improvement at a 5% or 6% higher price point, that way you cover your inflation, your labor inflation, or anything else that there happens to be there, the incremental cost of that improvement and you and the customer both win. Because the customer can take his retail price up, you can take your wholesale price up, and thereby protecting margins, and everybody wins and it's a fair trade.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open.
John Coyle - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys. It's John Coyle filling in for Steve. Can you maybe talk about the pace of activity over the course of the quarter? Did you see a deceleration as we got later into the year? And then maybe any thoughts on what you see now thus far in January?
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, this is Don. I would say that we didn't see anything that was really indicative of significant market trends. When it comes to our retail business in Tools & Storage, there's a lot of ebbs and flows in the quarter that are really dependent on when customers want products, refilling orders after the holiday season. So from a general market trend, we didn't see anything dramatic within the kind of consumer side of Tools & Storage. On the Industrial side, it was pretty much a consistent trend throughout the quarter, other than electronics. Obviously, electronics shifted to the negative dramatically in the month of November, and that held into December and is holding into the first quarter. So we're not necessarily taking anything as far as market trends in the fourth quarter as a big indicator to the first quarter and beyond, beyond some of the things that we've already discussed such as electronics and general industrial. But you know, I think the only thing that really shifted within the quarter would have been the electronics business with Engineered Fastening.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah and the other thing I'll add to that that I think most of us are aware of, as it relates to our retail customers and the retail business in general, one of the reasons Don said that between 18% and 19% of our earnings take place in the first quarter. January is always a very slow month. As I know you understand, and most people on the call do, our largest customers' fiscal years end in January. It's post-holiday season. They have a very appropriate objective of reducing or minimizing inventories as the year closes. So simply said, whatever happens in January, we don't ever think of it as a good predictor or indicator of how the year is going to start. We need pretty much a full first quarter, particularly on the retail side for that reason to get a flavor for where we are and where we're going. Importantly, Jim pointed out, I think, most important. POS was good in the fourth quarter, so inventories are in a good place. So nothing to suggest dire straits, but it's very early days.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie Securities Group. Your line is open.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Can you talk about the progress you made in North America Security margins related to the vertical markets' learning curve? And where are you maybe just give us an update on the evaluation of the overall Security portfolio within Stanley? Thanks.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Okay. I'll answer the second question first, and nothing's changed since we communicated in May of last year at our investor meeting that we would be doing an evaluation that would take about a year. And that we would during that period of time we were going to evaluate the operational performance as well as the strategic issues and opportunities related to the Security business and then we would come out with some sort of a position in the middle of 2016. And that continues to hold. As far as the North American Security business, I mean, I think we're finding that in the verticals, the healthcare vertical is doing absolutely fabulously. It's achieved mid-double digit margins, mid-teens. And the issue with that now is how to grow it faster. So we'll be making some investments to grow it faster, and it could be a substantial contributor to organic growth. The retail vertical I think is still kind of in the early days in terms of trying to figure out exactly where the value proposition could be and how big we can make that, how profitable it can be. And so I'd say we're probably in about the third or fourth inning with the retail. But I would expect by mid to late 2016, we would make a lot of progress on that front as well. I think the other verticals – and those are the two verticals that we're going to be emphasizing this year, and really get them right, get the healthcare one growing, get the retail strategy fully engaged. And then at that point, we'll decide do we want to add another vertical to our main area of focus.
Operator: Our final question comes from Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Your line is open.
Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC: Thanks. Good morning. And congrats on a very solid year. I wanted to ask you, Don, about the free cash flow. I mean, it's coming somewhat below initial expectations a year ago. And I wanted to understand what exactly drove the shortfall here. I suspect that forex trends were a significant contributing factor here, and so I'm wondering if we should expect even more of a headwind on cash flow in 2016 given the transactional effects that you called out earlier. Thanks.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. Yeah, I mean, as I mentioned in my comments, the free cash flow for 2015 came in a little bit lighter than we anticipated. And it was primarily due to less working capital liquidation as a result of the lower organic growth that we saw in the fourth quarter. And it's interesting, the timing of how it played out is usually what happens in our Tools & Storage business in particular is that we have high levels of revenue in October and November preparing for the holiday season as well as doing kind of refill orders after Black Friday. And then we collect a lot of that by the end of December. Because we saw a different trend occur in that particular business and obviously a lower organic growth number than our expectation, the result was that we didn't get the working capital turn that we were anticipating. We were anticipating turns of 9.5 times to 9.7 times. It came in at 9.2 times which are actually fantastic. And at this stage, working capital turn improvement becomes harder and harder. The other dynamic is as we grow organically and you saw the significant organic growth we had in 2015, you have to improve your working capital turns even more to get a cash flow benefit. So even with if we had achieved an improvement to 9.5 times to 9.7 times, we still would have had a slight negative within our cash flow statement for working capital. We would have had to get it much closer to 10 times to see a positive. And that's just the reality of what we're going to deal with going forward that we won't see large working capital benefits in the cash flow statement, and we want to continue to improve working capital and get it over 10 turns over the next few years. And hopefully when we – as we do that, the amount of impact to cash flow will be modest. It likely will be modestly negative. As a result, our cash flow on a go forward basis will still be very strong. As I said for 2016, I expect the conversion rate to be about 100% which would mean it's going to be somewhere between $900 million to $925 million for 2016. We always look to improve our working capital more than beyond our goals and expectations, so obviously we'll be driving to try to outperform that. But right now based on where we are with our working capital turns, we can't expect large cash flow benefits from that area and really the cash flow is going to come from the earnings performance and operational performance.

Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2015 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Stephanie and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor & Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.
Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations: Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third quarter 2015 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad applications. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim, and Don will review our third quarter 2015 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's, therefore, possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 1934 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, thanks, Greg. Good morning, everybody. We are fortunate to be in a position to report another healthy operational quarter featuring strong organic growth as well as margin expansion. You saw in the press release, organic growth was 6% offset by currency which was a negative 8%, and as a consequence, net sales were down 2%, as the foreign exchange headwinds we've talked about on past calls continue at historically high levels. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of organic growth, at or above 6% for the company on a combined basis, with impressive growth once again, from the Tools & Storage business, 9%. Jim will give you a lot more segment detail in just a minute. Our operating margin rate expanded to a post-merger record of 14.8%, which is 70 basis points ahead of third quarter 2014. And we attribute this to volume, with sharp cost focus, price realization in both developed and emerging markets and commodity deflation that, together, delivered robust operating leverage, despite $70 million in foreign currency pressure during the quarter. And we opportunistically repurchased about $200 million worth of shares within the quarter, capitalizing on the recent U.S. equity market declines. So the combination of organic growth and the margin expansion led the third quarter fully diluted EPS of $1.55, which is up 1% versus prior year, as the strong operational performance more than offset tax and restructuring headwinds. Specifically, the third quarter tax rate that Don will talk about, of 24.5% with 540 basis points higher than prior year, while restructuring charges in the quarter were approximately $14 million higher than the third quarter of 2014. So the restructuring charges were about a $0.07 (3:47) EPS headwind during the quarter. As a consequence of our third quarter performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're increasing 2015's full year GAAP EPS guidance range to $5.80 to $5.95, and that's up from our prior guidance of $5.70 to $5.90. So, up 8% to 11% versus the prior year. Not surprisingly, I'm just really pleased with our organization's demonstrable agility in delivering both organic growth and operating leverage in such a dynamic operating environment. Organic growth remained strong, but diving just a little bit deeper into the sources of our growth, it was broad-based. Volume grew 5% and was aided by 100 basis points of price realization, from a combination of efforts to combat the currency headwinds in many of our markets overseas, and the implementation of surgical pricing actions domestically, resulting in a total of 6% organic growth for the quarter. As already mentioned the foreign exchange headwinds remained severe and they detracted 8 percentage points from our performance during the quarter. All geographies grew mid-single digits, with the U.S. leading the pack and Europe growing well above market rates. Our emerging market group in the rest of the world also posted solid growth despite doing no business in Venezuela and softness in Russia, China, and Australia. Interestingly, Japan grew 8% driven by strong STANLEY Engineered Fastening performance in the automotive markets. Let's take a closer look at the segments and Jim is going to walk you through that in a lot more detail.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Okay. Thank you, John. I'll start with Tools & Storage. It was another banner quarter for the team in this strong momentum business. Revenue was up 2%, while operating margin grew 8%. We once again set a post-merger record with a 16.7% operating margin rate, demonstrating impressive leverage. Gains resulted from volume related incrementals, modestly positive price, variable cost productivity, continued tight SG&A cost management and some benefit from input price reductions, the combination of which more than offset severe currency headwinds. Organic growth remained strong, up 9%, overcoming a 9% comp in a noteworthy fifth quarter in a row at or above that 9% growth level. All regions contributed with strong performances as North America was up 11%, Europe was up 7% and emerging markets up 6%. Organic strength was prevalent across the global product lines with professional power tools up 9%, consumer power tools up 12%, accessories up 9%, and hand tools and storage up 8%. All categories benefited from strong customer level and new product commercial execution. Encouragingly, this overall performance shows that the Tools & Storage growth in innovation machine can continue to be successful in the face of tougher comps. The combination of the launch of our DEWALT Outdoor line as well as other enhanced products in conjunction with a more normal weather pattern this year resulted in the successful outdoor season that was up double digits for the quarter as well as year-to-date. POS was again robust across the channels, with major big-box customers in the U.S. continuing their recent strength. Aggregate weeks on-hand at retail is in a good place in line with historical levels. The U.S. hardware, lumber stores, STAFDA and online channels were again very strong as construction markets benefited from growth in end-user demand and our own commercial execution took that a step further. Mac Tools growth continued at impressive levels continuing to outpace the healthy North American automotive aftermarket on the strength of new product and a growing franchisee base. Not surprisingly, we did experience softness in our U.S. industrial markets, which was directly attributable to the slowdown in Oil & Gas and mining end markets. Europe continued with its impressive organic growth and commercial excellence, averaging 7% growth over the last 10 quarters in a flattish market. The share gains in the quarter have been broad with almost all markets showing a positive performance. The stream of new innovative products, adding new points of distribution and leveraging our stable of iconic brands is a winning model that continues to reinforce our position as the world leader in Tools & Storage. Emerging market organic growth was again encouraging at 6% as double-digit performance in Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia more than offset steep declines in Russia and a weak performance in China. The mid-price point product rollout, led by STANLEY Branded Power Tools, continued to be timely and effective as end users tend to be more value-oriented in economies under economic duress. And clearly the scale, maturity and depth of our emerging market team, in conjunction with this important initiative, continues to bolster our organic growth and overall developing market performance in a more than challenging and volatile environment. I would like to take just a moment to recognize our Global Tools & Storage management team in both the developed and developing markets. The results speak for themselves. Organic growth averaging 10% over the last five quarters, margins up by 130 basis points year-to-date and at record levels despite about 150 points of FX pressure expected for the year, SFS 2.0 is clearly enabling strong customer execution, outsized organic growth, margin expansion and over 9 working capital turns. And some people have the perception that we are simply riding the U.S. construction and DIY wave, and we are to an extent. However, only about 40% of the Global Tools business benefits from that. What we're clearly seeing is the manifestation of a performance culture grounded in SFS, second and third order benefits from the Stanley Black & Decker merger and the potential of the world's leading Tools & Storage franchise. What is exciting is that there is even more opportunity ahead as the team takes SFS 2.0 to the next level, which we will begin to see in 2016. Now, moving to Security. This was clearly a quarter of advancement for Security, demonstrating the operational progress that we are looking for as we pursue our multi-year plan to transform the business. Execution within Europe was outstanding and both the North American electronics and mechanical locks businesses took encouraging steps forward. Europe, again, had a long list of accomplishments, including 4% organic growth, another double-digit order rate performance, attrition rates within their target zone, and operating margin which improved versus prior year for the fourth consecutive quarter and is now in the high single digits. Commercial execution exhibited good breadth with organic growth achieved in all major geographic markets and signs that we are beginning to move the market share needle into positive territory. In recent quarters, our European management team has demonstrated the winning spirit that comes with consistently delivering organic growth and profitability commitments, while winning in the marketplace. The U.S. mechanical lock business also showed progress with 4% organic growth and improving profitability. Our management team remains focused on specification writing, revitalizing product lines through innovation and driving commercial excellence. North American electronics security had a mixed quarter with more positives than negatives. On the plus side, there was sequential margin expansion, operational stability and financial predictability. And on the other side of the ledger, inorganic revenue decline. While we continue to improve field operational performance, increase order rates and grow a healthy backlog, the opportunity to deliver growth and margin expansion is there in coming quarters. And Security is relatively a small emerging market domain, significant softness in China cut into overall segment organic growth and profitability, once again muting some of the gains across the other businesses. Now, turning to Industrial. Industrial delivered another steady performance from Engineered Fastening and weathered market-related declines within Infrastructure. And that result was a 7% decrease in revenue as flat organic growth was more than offset by 7 points negative currency. Margins were up modestly, as volume leverage in Engineered Fastening, tight cost controls and pricing, more than offset the negative impact of foreign exchange and organic declines in the Infrastructure businesses. Engineered Fastening posted 3% organic growth led by double-digit performance in automotive, once again, outpacing global light vehicle production which was relatively flat in the quarter. Additionally, we saw a solid growth within electronics. This growth offset lower North America Industrial sales tied to weakening market conditions. All in all, it was an impressive quarter of organic growth and margin expansion for Engineered Fastening, despite the translational currency headwinds experienced within the business. Infrastructure, which includes Oil & Gas and Hydraulics, was down 10%, in line with our expectations. Oil & Gas was down 7% as signs of life in the onshore North American market were not enough to offset continued declines and global onshore and offshore pipeline activity. Growth in Hydraulics was down 17%, as volume in our demolition shares is correlated to pricing levels in the scrap steel market. In summary, it was a solid operational performance by the Industrial teams, holding organic growth flat and expanding the operating margin rate despite soft infrastructure and global industrial markets as well as a significant currency drag. So, as we assess this quarter's performance in the aggregate, it represents another strong quarter for the overall company with 6% organic growth and record operating margin levels that expanded 70 basis points despite approximately 150 basis points of currency headwinds. We are now on track to grow EPS 8% to 11% in 2015 despite friction from external obstacles including the strong dollar and dynamic end markets. We are also in good shape for 2016. Our balance sheet is solid and at current exchange rates, our FX headwinds will begin to decrease and we have a series of growth and margin enhancing initiatives, both underway and planned. We also have a solid M&A pipeline and expect to resume our inorganic growth activities in a measured but meaningful way in the near future. We look forward to finishing 2015 at our upgraded EPS guidance levels and entering 2016 with a viable roadmap for revenue, cash flow and EPS growth. We thank you and I'll now turn it over to Don Allan.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Jim. I'd like to begin with our third quarter and year-to-date free cash flow performance. For the third quarter, free cash flow was $171 million, which was down modestly from last year's results. This brings the year-to-date performance to $174 million. The lower year-to-date results compared to the prior year is mainly explained by higher inventory levels needed in the summer and the fall of 2015, which were required to service the increased levels of organic growth we are experiencing, primarily within the Tools & Storage business. The core SFS principles require agility to respond when business conditions change, such as the strong organic growth we have experienced recently. SFS has enabled us to reach working capital and asset efficiency levels that are considered world-class compared to our industrial and security peers, while being agile to changing market conditions to ensure we meet our customers' needs. We expect that by the end of 2015, we will deliver approximately a 0.5 working capital turn improvement versus the prior year and achieve turns within the range of 9.5 to 9.7 times, which will demonstrate another step closer towards achieving our goal of 10 working capital turns. However, given our strong organic growth performance in 2015 of 6%, the 0.5 working capital turn improvement will not translate into cash flow benefit for the full year of 2015 but, instead, will result in a modest cash outflow. This is one of the benefits of great strong organic growth as it begins to become a bit of a pressure to your cash flow. One other item of note related to cash flow, the improvement of approximately 3 turns from 6.4 turns in Q3 to the end of the year is heavily influenced by the normal Tools & Storage seasonality. For those of you who have followed our business for many years know that this fourth quarter Tools & Storage seasonality dynamic is a regular occurrence given the timing of sales and shipments as they occur within the quarter. This outstanding working capital results, combined with capital expenditure control and our improved earnings outlook will result in the company delivering free cash flow approaching $1 billion in 2015. As John mentioned, during the quarter we also executed opportunistic share repurchases of $200 million. This brings our cumulative total share actions to the equivalent of $1.2 billion in the last 12 months. As we have reviewed during our Investor Day in May, you should expect us to return over time to a capital allocation of approximately 50% of our free cash flow being deployed through M&A, and the other 50% through our shareholders via dividends and the occasional opportunistic share repurchase. Let's move to the next page in our updated 2015 outlook. As indicated by John earlier and Jim, we are increasing the 2015 EPS range to $5.80 to $5.95 versus the previous range of $5.70 to $5.90. We are able to raise our outlook primarily due to strong business performance across several areas of the company, driven by commodity deflation and cost control. In particular, we are starting to see stronger than initially expected benefits from steel, resin and other base metals that manifest themselves in our income statement's result. However, these benefits are partially offset by foreign exchange headwind that is now expected to be at the high end of our previous $200 million to $220 million range, when you use current rates. Most of that impact is related to the weakening of the Brazilian real over the last two or three months. The net result of these changes is $0.07 to $0.08 increase to our midpoint outlook range that I just provided. Moving to the right side of the page and a little bit more detail on the segments. First, let's start with Tools & Storage. We continue to expect high single-digit organic revenue growth within Tools & Storage. This is slightly better than compared to our July outlook. We also expect solid operating margin rate expansion year-over-year in this segment due to volume leverage, cost actions, price, and commodity deflation I just mentioned, which will more than offset the impact of currency. Security remains on track with the forecast we provided in last quarter's guidance. Margins for the full year are expected to be generally consistent with the prior year on relatively flat organic revenue. Industrial will continue to benefit from the momentum in our Engineered Fastening Electronics and Automotive businesses, which will be modestly offset by slow growth and/or pressure in some of the general industrial markets, and infrastructure that Jim touched on. However, this still has us on a path for low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the year with a solid operating margin performance. In summary, our revised EPS guidance range demonstrates a strong year-to-date performance across much of the company, which means we are now on track for 8% to 11% EPS growth, despite currency headwinds of appropriately $220 million or $1.10 of EPS. Before leaving this page, I would like to make a few comments regarding 2016. While it is premature to get into a lot of detail for 2016, the current exchange rates will result in approximately $100 million headwind. This is related to continued devaluations of various currencies, including the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar, as well as the impact of our 2015 transactional foreign exchange hedges rolling off next year. Similar to what we did in 2015, we are proactively identifying cost reductions, aggressively pursuing commodity deflation, and other pricing opportunities to partially mitigate this impact and will position us to demonstrate continued operating leverage in 2016, as well as reasonable earnings growth. So let's summarize the presentation portion of our call today. We delivered a very strong third quarter performance and here are some of the highlights. We are very pleased with another quarter of strong organic growth, our fifth in a row at or above 6%. The proactive tight cost controls and surgical price actions across the entire company enabled excellent third quarter operating leverage in the face of $70 million of currency headwinds. The third item is progress continues with Security's multiyear transformation, with sequential improvement across most of the operations, and we were very pleased with the result. We were also able to execute additional share repurchases in the third quarter, as I mentioned, bringing the total share count actions we have taken since the start of the fourth quarter of 2014 to $1.2 billion. As we communicated during our Investor Day in May, our focus in 2015 and beyond will be on leveraging our world-class franchises and brands, strong free cash flow generation and continued shareholder friendly capital allocation. This continues to manifest itself and are focused on accelerating organic growth through SFS 2.0, while supplementing that growth with acquisitions, advancing securities multi-year transformation to achieve consistent low-single digit organic growth and 15% profitability by 2018. Also continuing our disciplined approach to cost and pricing actions to ensure we have annual operating leverage as we grow. And finally, an ongoing focus on working capital turns. We believe this approach will help position our company to continue our strong performance trend and achieve our long-term financial objectives. Thank you. And that concludes the presentation portion of our call. Now let's move to Q&A.
Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations: Great. Thanks, Don. Stephanie, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer-session. Our first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to squeeze in two questions here. But Jim or John, could you comment on price as you start to look at 2016 with the deflationary environment? A lot of companies are starting to struggle in terms of pushing through price, like to get your views on that. And then in terms of the near term on Industrial, how do you feel about the landscape right now? There are some pressures in the environment. Have you baked in some cushion around Industrial and the landscape peers as we move out the next few months? Thanks.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Don is going to give you the view on price going forward, to the extent we're going to talk about it for 2016. And then Jim, I think, can give you a little deeper dive on Industrial and our thoughts.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, Rich. On pricing, I think it's a couple of dynamics. One is, certainly, we've been able to achieve positive pricing benefits because of some of the negative foreign exchange impact we've had in emerging markets in particular, and even a little bit in our European regions as well. So, as we import our products into those particular regions and we are impacted negatively by foreign currency, we obviously try to recoup as much of that as possible through pricing actions in the local market. With us having a continued headwind going into 2016, we will continue to be prudent about our approach in that area and go after specific price actions where it makes sense, given the different dynamics in those markets. So we do think there will be ability to gain some price in emerging markets as a result of that pressure from foreign currency. In more developed markets like the United States, or even Europe where we're manufacturing product and selling it within the region, pricing will continue to be an area that we stay very focused on. We've been heavily focused on specific surgical pricing actions in the last year-and-a-half to two years in those developed markets. We don't see any reason for that to change. I think the commodity deflation impact will be an area that we have to watch closely. It impacts certain types of products and it doesn't impact other products quite as much. And as I said, being surgical allows you to evaluate those types of decisions.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Jim, talk about the three pieces. Obviously, Rich, you're aware that STANLEY Engineered Fastening is the overwhelming majority of our Industrial segment. But they really are responding to some very different market dynamics.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yes. I think, when you talk about Industrial, it always boils down to the sub-segments both geographically and also just sub-segments within industrial categories. And I think what we see right now in the North American market is a dichotomy between some of the more difficult end markets, such as oil and gas, mining and ag in particular, and then we see continued, I won't call it buoyancy, but maybe continued perseverance in the automotive market. So while automotive kind of chugs on, I think that's driven largely by the kind of the resurgence in consumer and also the ageing fleet. So automotive is very important to Engineered Fastening, about 40% of its revenues or so. And as long as automotive is healthy, that particular part of the business is going to be fairly healthy. And then, of course, electronics is the other big part of Engineered Fastening, another big part, and that continues to be strong as well. And then the general kind of MRO-related industrial, it's a function of kind of the accumulation of the sub-segments. And that is a little bit on the weak side right now in North America. You can see it from some of the results of the distributors that have actually come out; so a mixed bag in North America. We don't see it going negative at this point. It's flattish and maybe slightly up or slightly down, but kind of hovering around the flattish. And then Europe, Europe has been challenged in that flattish kind of a way for a long time, and we see a little bit of negative drag in Europe but nothing catastrophic at this point. I think the weak euro as much as the strong dollar has hurt exports in the U.S. The weak euro tends to have the potential to maybe boost the industrial in Europe a little bit. So I think on balance we do see some pressure in industrial. We have factored that into our thought process, but we don't see recessionary conditions, although industrial production is relatively weak in the aggregate right now.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: The only thing I'd add, Rich, and we'll move on, when Jim talked about the North American markets in our sub-segments, he mentioned obviously oil and gas, mining, ag, and the relatively depressed prices in the scrap steel market has had an impact on our hydraulics business. Of course, demolition, as you know, is a very large part of that. So we've got those headwinds in a couple of our smaller businesses, but a modestly healthy environment in Engineered Fastening, both domestically and abroad. I mentioned a bright spot in Japan for us, which was quite encouraging, and the business is doing quite well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. The question I had was just regarding getting a little bit more granularity with the adjustments to the full-year guidance. If you kind of take the midpoint of the prior FX headwind to where you are expecting today, it doesn't seem like it's that much more, maybe $10 million, $15 million, or $10 million from the midpoint. So just want to understand versus three months ago, what were the biggest drivers of those? And then conversely in terms of the upside stronger business performance combined with better commodity deflation, if you think of like $10 million incremental headwind to get to the guidance range, we're talking about maybe another $25 million of positive roughly speaking. So if that math is right, $25 million, $30 million of incremental positive, how does that break down between the stronger business performance and the commodity deflation? And more specifically, where within the business are you seeing that better performance and what's the bigger weight?
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Rank has its privileges and I'm going to let Don try to tackle that one. There are a lot of moving pieces, Mike. But I think Don can kind of tie a little bit of a bow on it for you.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. Your math is actually pretty close, so as you think about us raising our midpoint by about $0.07 or $0.08 of EPS, yeah, we probably have about $10 million of new FX pressure. As I said, we're at the higher end of that range; that's about $0.05 of EPS. And then you have about $25 million or so of positive impact from commodity deflation and other indirect cost controls. And the net of those two items gets you basically to $0.07 and $0.08.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Your line is open.
Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus a little bit on the Tools & Storage segment. Margins were very strong. I understand the good volume leverage here, but looks like we're coming in at the high end of that range that you've talked about in the past as being sort of the cyclical high margins that we could expect from this business. Any change in your view here given that at this point you still have 150 points of forex pressure in those margins? Should we envision margins continuing to trend up into next year as long as volumes go up? And the other question, a follow-up on this, is I understand you have very strong share gains across regions. I just wanted to get a better sense of what do you see in terms of the underlying demand trends in North America in particular.
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Sure. This is Jim. When we think about margins and margins through the cycle, we don't necessarily let the cycle drive the margins, per se. We tend to be much more proactive about it. So at the down part of the cycle, we're taking out cost at a very healthy pace. And as we enjoy the ride up the cycle, we don't back off in terms of some of the things that we do to maintain the upward pressure, everything we can do to maintain the upward pressure on margins. So I think the potential for what you're calling the peak cycle margin rate is quite high. And I think evidence of that is if this whole FX headwind hadn't occurred, we would be at record-margins for the company and the Tool business. So the things that we do are things like continuous productivity, 3% to 4% cost productivity. Every year we have a very, very surgical and data-driven pricing program in this company, which goes across all the businesses, including the Tool business, where we constantly are improving our subject matter expertise and our analytics in pricing and looking at price/volume tradeoffs and making sure that we're optimizing our margins and our overall margin in that regard. And then we have design-to-value which is a more programmatic approach to driving cost out of products. In the design cycle we have a simplification and complexity reduction program, which again drives cost out of the products and we have mix management. We are doing everything that we know how to do to drive margins up. And where that limit is, we don't know, but we constantly try to drive them up. So I think that's kind of the way we think about it. As far as the share picture in various geographies in the Tool business, I have to say that I don't think there is any region in the world, except with the possible exception of China, where we are not gaining share. And this business has implemented a commercial excellence initiative, which has taken the strength of Stanley and Black & Decker's scale, its brands, its products, its innovation, and it is driving that across all geographies in a very aggressive way and it's been very successful and we expect it to continue to do so.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And Jeremie, it's John. Just to add to that, both in terms of our drive for margins and share gain, more from a qualitative perspective, but I think it's demonstrable. In the past two months we've been named category-specific Vendor of the Year by our two largest customers. Never before, at least in our history, I've been here 11 years and Jim and Don 15 years, have we achieved such coveted and prestigious recognition from our two largest customers in the same year. And I think if nothing else, or just anecdotally, that's a tribute to the strength of our brand, the strength of the programs, and the commercial execution that Jim was talking about. And obviously, those kinds of things are leading to share gain and we're pleased with that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. John, you briefly just mentioned China and I just have a question overall thinking about kind of the dynamics in the EMs and Tools & Storage specifically. A very strong performance as you characterized with strong Latin America offsetting weaker Russia and China. It's being difficult for Latin America to continue to carry that ball with what's going on in Brazil, et cetera. Just wondering if you could kind of give us a little bit more granular lay of the land on how you expect...
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes...
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC: ...those things to play out.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Sure, Jeff. Very fair. To give you some numbers because it – boy, they're all over the place, but Latin America, what we call our Latin American group organically grew 13%. Brazil, which is the largest by far market, we grew 4% organically. But obviously, we're suffering some huge currency headwinds that Don talked about. But we have smaller countries, Venezuela, as I say where we've done zero business essentially for about the last six quarters. We had good performance in Mexico, good performance in Colombia; Brazil as I say, up low-single digits, which gave us low-double digit growth in Latin America. Country-specific, they represent a small percentage of our volume, but Russia was down 30%, China was down 28%. We think that's not inconsistent with the markets in general. The silver lining in the clouds for us particularly in China is the expansion of our mid-price-point product offerings, locally produced by a subsidiary that we control. We think that in and of itself is going to help us a lot, but we we're working off some high comps. The bad news is we're down 25% to 30% in both Russia and China. The good news is those are very small markets and a small base. So $2 million, $3 million, $4 million of improvement will bring us back to where we were. What we're doing about it? I think the simplest way to describe it, we aren't withdrawing, we aren't cutting back, we've stopped adding feet on the street and variable cost resources at the pace we were adding them, but we haven't cut anything, and we're reallocating resources within our emerging market group, Asia, and to a lesser extent Latin America, because we just think those are still huge economies, 45% or 46% of our business is still outside the U.S., that includes Europe, of course, and we're not going to withdraw our support for those markets. So, a long answer to a simple question, but I think the huge volatility in certain countries gives you a flavor for how we're approaching it. It's much more a question we're reallocating resources as opposed to cutting them, because we're in these bit markets for the long haul.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on the Security segment. You've got kind of diverging trends here. On one hand the previous problem area in terms of Europe is improving and seeing accelerating organic growth, and now it seems like you're seeing some deceleration in North America and emerging markets, I guess, on the electronics side in particular. So just curious, as you look out to – obviously, you've outlined a path to what you need to see from this overall business over the next year. How are these trends playing into that? Are you more or less positive on the positioning of the business as you see it today versus how you were thinking about it three months or six months ago?
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Fair question. Don will give you a little detail, but I guess from top of the house, I can say we feel as good or better about these businesses as we have in the past. You talked about Europe; they're delivering on their commitments, which pleases us and pleases the folks there. And we think we have the right people in the right chairs. And we think we understand what the issues are within North American Security. Don has been spending a lot of time with that team. So let me have him give you a little more granularity.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. Thanks, John. So, what John said is exactly correct. And, yeah, we're really pleased, and Jim went through it in a lot of detail in his presentation around the European performance, how it continues to improve, demonstrating a short stretch of time here of consistent organic growth, sequential improvement in operating margin rate. All the things that we talked about a year ago that we wanted to accomplish for that business; we're seeing them really get traction in all those areas. In North America, I wouldn't say that we feel like we're losing traction or slowing down. We definitely know that we had a little bit of a, kind of a blip on the radar in the second quarter of this year because of a large installation that completed itself. It didn't repeat, as you can see, in the third quarter because the third quarter bounced back to our expectations. They're actually slightly better than our expectations around profitability. And we continue to deal with an evolving and changing environment related to our vertical selling solutions, specifically targeting two verticals, retail and healthcare, as an area to really concentrate and help the business grow. The positive in North America that I see is that the backlog continues to grow and the order rates are double-digits and these are trends that we've seen now for two quarters or three quarters, which is positioning us well for next year to demonstrate some organic growth in North America in electronic security and mechanical security, for that matter. The last piece is China. I mean, overall, emerging markets is relatively small for the Security business. And outside of China, it's doing relatively well. But in China, because of the economic circumstances, market conditions, we've definitely seen some of the retrenching revenue declines that John mentioned in China a few minutes ago of double-digit declines, and that's been significant. We think that's more market related. It's not a big part of the business. Like everyone else, I think we all think China will begin to gradually get back on track at some point in the next two quarters to three quarters probably. So we're not overly concerned about that. So our focus now is continued execution improvement in Europe; continued execution improvement in North America, and really hunker down in the emerging markets, get through this period of time in China and then begin to demonstrate growth as we come out of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.
Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Good job again in a tough environment.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I just had a bigger picture question on Tools. What inning do you think we're in around some of the adoption of some of the new technology development that's been going on, whether it's brushless or just improved battery performance? And I guess would you characterize this as maybe a technology step function that's similar to what lithium-ion was a few years ago or several years ago?
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I would say, Tim, it's a really good question, and I would say no. Lithium-ion, if you think about it relative to NiCad, it was a better mousetrap, more power, longer run times, better for the environment, and the only issue was cost. And like any technological breakthrough, when you can get the cost in line, it's going to displace its predecessor. What we're seeing now and I don't think is a step function, I think to answer your question, which is a very fair one, and it's only one person's opinion that you're getting. That being said, the leverage for us is going to come from what I think we do best. We weren't the inventors of brushless. We obviously didn't invent, and we were a slow follower on the application of lithium-ion and things of that nature. Where I believe we've excelled, and I give tremendous credit to our global Tools & Storage team, both in the product development perspective, commercial execution, et cetera, is just the application of all of those technologies. The application of brushless, lithium-ion, the way we've been able to get more power, more run time combined with the DEWALT brand, good programs to support it, those are all, I would argue, incremental as opposed to step functions. And that's where our success has come the last two years or three years. Is there more on the horizon? I think, yeah. I think we can see we're cautiously optimistic about what our team has in the pipeline in terms of further advancements of those existing technologies, but I don't see anything in the application of those technologies, but I don't see another lithium-ion, if you will, breakthrough per se in the foreseeable future. But that doesn't mean we're not going to push those hard and get more than our fair share of the market growth by applying the technologies.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us some color in terms of the North America vertical products in Security, just what the life cycle on the margins look like relative to your more typical products there? If you could just differentiate maybe on the installs, would we expect lighter, is that what we're seeing now and does that become more of a tailwind as you get more to recurring with the vertical products?
James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. I'll take that one, Mike. You know the verticals that we're really concentrating on right now are retail and healthcare. And, as you know, the idea of a vertical selling solutions is to really create a solution that offers much more than just security to our customers. Security is certainly a core component of the solution, but are there other things that we can do, such as in retail where we provide certain information and database on traffic flow in and out of the stores, correlating that with POS, et cetera. In healthcare, we're looking at helping productivity within the healthcare environment, the nurses and doctors, and offering solutions in that area to help the customers reduce cost or save money. And so, the model is really to bring forth those types of solutions that give more value, and does that translate into more beyond the installation into certain types of recurring revenue streams. And, that's really the intention of it. At this stage, it's still early development around that. But as we get deeper into these verticals and particularly the two that I just mentioned, I do believe that certain recurring revenue streams will evolve from those types of solutions. So, I think that's something you continue to watch and monitor. It's an area of focus as part of our strategy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Robert F. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys. Good morning.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
Robert F. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Just a quick housekeeping first. I wanted to clarify those growth rates John was giving earlier on the emerging markets, if that was for just Tools or the total company. But then, my question was really on SG&A, 21.5% of sales, very good performance. It actually looks like a record, at least, in recent history. Just wanted to unpack a little more what's driving that, how much is structural and how should we be modeling SG&A going forward? Thank you.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'll clarify the first one. The numbers that I gave, the growth rates or lack thereof in some of the emerging markets, were total company. That being said, with the exception of certain Asian markets, that is overwhelmingly Global Tools & Storage. As Don mentioned, Singapore, China, some, we got meaningful Security business, 20% of our total in those markets. But they were total company numbers which were overwhelmingly Tools & Storage. But Don, you want to talk about...
Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: SG&A. Sure. Yeah. So the performance, very pleased with the SG&A as a percentage of revenue in Q3 at 21.5% or in that category. But for the year, we do expect us to be somewhere around 22.3%, 22.4% for the total year. We do have some additional costs that do creep into the systems for lack of better word, in the fourth quarter related to some of the promotional activities we do and in-store activities around the holidays that will likely make that number creep up a little bit in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. But we are definitely seeing another step-change in this particular area in 2015. So, in 2014, we were close to 23% as a percentage of revenue, and when we end the year, we'll be somewhere between 22.2% and 22.4% by the time we close out the year. So, that's a significant improvement. Part of that is what we've been doing for the last two years around indirect cost focus and how do we become more efficient, how do we drive more benefits and productivity in the use of those particular dollars. And then also, we've had a little bit of benefit, although it's not huge, from consolidating our CDIY and IAR businesses into the new business called Tools & Storage. So those things together have really helped leverage that objective. And I do think we're at a point now where we can continue to drive that down further. As you know, we talked about – I specifically talked about it in Investor Day, that we think we can get this number down even further through functional transformation, as well as taking some of those savings that we achieved and reinvest in things of digital excellence, commercial excellence, breakthrough innovation, et cetera. But the net result is really to drive our operating margins to 16%, and a lot of that's going to come from what we're trying to do in SG&A along the way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is open.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good morning.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: The Black & Decker brand has been fairly successful in your mid-price point overseas. But how is the Black & Decker brand being positioned domestically?
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, the Black & Decker brand domestically – I've got to bifurcate, Liam, but just from the perspective of Tools, it's overwhelmingly domestically a DIY brand, and it's performing really, really well. You'll find it in the home centers, but you'll also find it in big boxes like Target, like Walmart and places like that, where it's very, very well perceived. A large outlook for the Black & Decker brand, which I'm sure you're aware of, but I need to be careful to distinguish, it's in the home products, both in the U.S. and in Europe. The overwhelming majority of those products are licensed, as I'm sure you know, and we obviously receive a royalty for the use of that brand on products designed for use in the home and primarily in the kitchen secondarily. So, it's important to bifurcate. But in both cases, it's DIY non-professional, but premium quality for folks who are doing it not for a living, but folks who are serious about the product they purchase.
Operator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on a great quarter.
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: I guess the question on engineered fasteners and then just the automotive business in particular. And I realize you're not talking about 2016 yet, but automotive is a business where maybe there is a little more forward visibility because of the platforms. And I'm just wondering about your content per vehicle and how you expect that to grow in 2016, if you can talk about that?
John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, our strategy is always to grow our content for vehicle. And as you know, we're selling solutions. We're selling the equipment or the systems as well as the consumables that go with it. I am not going to get ahead of myself or ourselves or the business particularly as it relates to anything proprietary with our customers. But our strategy is always to increase the content per vehicle, and that in and of itself, is a great source of growth. And it's why we've been able to grow in some cases 2 times and 3 times the rate of light vehicle production. And what's playing to our strength there, and I know you understand our business very well, what's playing to our strength there is the lighter that the vehicles become, particularly aluminum, it plays to our strength when you can't well protect for obvious technical reasons, that advantages systems such as ours, so we're looking to grow that content, and that absolutely is the source of growth, all things being equal, above and beyond the growth of light vehicle production.
Operator: And that does conclude the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Greg Waybright for closing remarks.
Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations: Stephanie, thank you. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call, and obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect. And, everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Welcome to the Q2 2015 Stanley Black & Decker Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amanda, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.
Greg Waybright: Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter 2015 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review our second quarter 2015 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we’re going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John Lundgren: Hey. Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. This is an encouraging quarter to say the least, as everything from organic growth, the margin, earnings and capital allocation demonstrated that innovation is robust, SFS 2.0. is gaining traction and our management team and our 50,000 associates around the world are demonstrating agility and executing really well in a volatile environment and as a consequence they are overcoming numerous challenges that are well beyond their control. So let’s get to it, second quarter organic growth of 8%, offset by currency of negative 8%, so essentially flat revenue. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of organic growth at or above 6% with Tools and Storage leading the way up with 11% organic growth. We as a company achieved and delivered growth across all three segments. The Black & Decker merger closed in the first quarter of 2010, more than five years ago and our operating margin in 2Q ‘15 expanded to a post-merger record of 14.4%, plus 70 basis points versus second quarter 2014. Volume with sharp cost focus and price realization delivered robust operating leverage despite a $50 million foreign currency pressure. There are lots of puts and takes with respect to FX and Don will provide a lot more detail around this in our estimate for the year, which still includes $200 million to $220 million of foreign exchange headwind that we have every intention of overcoming. Second quarter diluted EPS was a $1.54, up 11% versus prior year, overwhelmingly, on strong operational performance. And on June 23rd, we announced the dividend increase of 6% from -- to $0.55 a share from $0.52, that maintains our compelling dividend payout and as well as, an unrivaled history on the New York Stock Exchange in terms of continuity of dividend payment and increasing the dividend. As a consequence of a great first half and actions we are taking up for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our 2015 full year GAAP EPS guidance range to $5.70 to $5.90 from $5.65 to $5.85, so the range is now up 6% to 10% versus 2014 and that’s despite a $1 to $1.10 per share foreign currency earnings pressure. Let’s take a look at our sources of growth, which in fact were very similar in terms of both source and geography for the first quarter of 2015. Volume was up 7%. We got 1% from price, leading to the 8% organic growth that I referred to previously. No impact from acquisitions, offset by 8% price, so you see flat revenue for the year -- for the first half of the year, as well as for the second quarter. All geographies showed some strength, with the U.S. leading the way at 11%, strong growth in Europe [Technical Difficulty] despite relatively stagnant market condition, emerging markets as a total were up 4% despite some areas of weakness, specifically Russia and China that Jim will talk to you about in a minute, and the rest of the world was up 7%. So the very, very strong second quarter back to back up 8% organic growth, so enough from the total there is lots of really good news and strong momentum within each of our three segments. So let me turn it over to Jim to take closer look.
Jim Loree: Okay. Thanks, John. I'll start with Tools and Storage, which continues to be a great story. Revenue was up 4% while operating margin grew 9%, we said our post-merger record with a 64.4% rate, once again demonstrating impressive operating leverage, gains resulted from volume leverage, modestly positive price, operational productivity and continued tight SG&A cost management, which more than offset another quarter of severe currency headwinds. Organic growth remained in double-digit territory, this time 11% averaging a noteworthy 10% over the last four quarters. All regions contributed with strong performances as North America was up 14%, Europe 7% and emerging markets accelerated to 5% growth. Across the global product lines, organic strength was broad-based, with Professional Power Tools up 14%, Consumer Power Tools up 15%, Accessories up 12% and Hand Tools & Storage up 5%. The categories benefited from strong customer level execution and new product introductions as the Tools and Storage innovation machine not only remains robust but continues to gain momentum. Contributing to growth within the quarter was an outdoor season, which is tracking to a more normal pattern. Against this backdrop we released the stream of new products in the category, including the DeWALT outdoor, which delivers a full line of products with the performance and runtime demanded by long care professionals that includes a compelling new [indiscernible] line which competes favorably with many gas power tools. This is a great example of DC brushless technology and advances in lithium-ion that have opened up segments that historically have not been served by cordless. POS was again robust to get across the channels with major big-box customers in the U.S. continuing their strength, aggregate weeks on hand, are in a good place remaining at or below prior year levels. We also believe sell-through in the hardware, lumber store and staff channels was very strong as both resi and non-resi markets -- construction markets benefited from good growth in end user demand. The e-commerce channel continues to grow an importance, particularly for the DIY end-user. This is true for both big-box and independent retailers. Not surprisingly Industrial markets in the U.S. remained somewhat weaker than we saw in 2014, but we are still positive. For the ninth consecutive quarter, we are able to highlight Europe at an impressive growth story for Tools. The business is averaged 7% organic growth over this time period in a relatively flat market. Our team continues to control their destiny by leveraging our broad stable of leading brands, launching new innovative products across categories and adding new points of distribution. European Tools represents a prime example of commercial excellence and action as we define it in SFS 2.0. Growth within Tools emerging markets accelerated in the quarter as a double-digit performance in Latin America and solid growth in India, Turkey, the Middle East and Africa was enough to overcome a steep market related decline in Russia and a weak performance in China. The mid-price point product rollout led by our Stanley Power Tool line continues to proceed successfully and this important initiative provided support for emerging market growth amidst volatile underlying market conditions. And looking at the markets, our estimate is that the U.S. is growing about 5% to 7%. In constant currency, the European market is slightly positive and the emerging markets are growing about 2% to 3%. On a global basis, this takes our total market growth in 2Q at about 3% to 4%, which when compared with our 11% organic performance implies continued share again. Many ask us whether or not the high levels of growth can continue as the comps get tougher and global GDP trends slightly lower. Our response has been consistent. Organic growth in the double digits against this backdrop will be difficult to sustain, however, in the environment we are operating in. This business has the ability to deliver growth within our 4% to 6% targeted levels on an ongoing basis. We have leading brands, global scale and organization that continue to raise its own high standards for innovation, as well for commercial and supply chain excellence. And clearly we are well on the way to creating the organic growth culture and vision when we integrated Stanley and Black & Decker. SFS 2.O is the new catalyst, which will continue to drive momentum. Now moving to security. We continue to make progress on most underlying businesses in security, although this quarter it was two steps forward and one back. Execution in both Europe and the North America Mechanical Locking businesses was very encouraging. However, North American convergent, we are continuing to deal with growing pains related to an increasingly complex business mix, specifically installing jobs efficiently. It was truly a watershed quarter for Europe, where the list of the compliments, including 3% organic growth and double-digit order rates, attrition within target ranges and the successful sale of Spain and Italy, with nominal but positive cash proceeds. Our European management team is executing well and delivering their turnaround commitments. North American Mechanical Lock business also showed excellent progress with 4% organic growth and improving profitability. The business looks to finally be emerging from the challenges of the distribution model change era and is now focused on revitalizing its performance through innovation and commercial excellence. The biggest challenge of the quarter was in our North American Electronics business, where continued gains in vertical markets were achieved at the expense of core growth as the team struggled with the efficient installation of some of the larger, more complex vertical market jobs. These challenges are well understood and being addressed by our new and capable management team. Softness in Asia also cut into security 2Q organic growth and profitability. So, overall, we made some very good operational progress in the quarter with some isolated and manageable issues. We continued to be confident in a positive trajectory for security and remain committed to our assessment of its strategic fit by the second half of 2016. Now turning to Industrial. Industrial had a solid quarter, led by another steady performance from Engineered Fastening and Resilient Infrastructure business, the latter of which is battling significant market headwinds in oil and gas and hydraulics. The net result was a 4% decrease in revenue as 4% organic growth was more than offset by an 8 point negative currency headwind. Margins rebounded sequentially to 19.1% and expanded 140 basis points versus 2014, while operating margin grew by $3 million or 3%. Volume leverage across Engineered Fastening and Oil and Gas, combined with tight cost controls and pricing, more than offset the negative profit impact of foreign exchange. Engineered Fastening delivered a 4% organic performance, led by high single-digit automotive growth, once again outpacing light vehicle production, which was relatively flat. Additionally, we saw solid growth within Electronics. This was offset lower North American Industrial sales tied to a slowing market. So it was an impressive quarter of organic growth and margin expansion despite the translational currency headwinds experienced within the business. Infrastructure which include oil and gas and hydraulics, was up 3%, quite an accomplishment considering the market exposures of these businesses. Oil and gas benefited from a large international equipment sale, which contributed to 11% organic growth for the quarter. We still expect this business to decline organically for the full year, but this quarter's results are a great example of the team’s willingness to drive forward in the face of market headwinds. Growth was moderated by a 13% decline within the hydraulics business, which services demolition markets that are highly correlated to the vagaries of the scrap steel market. All in all, it was a solid operational performance in industrial with organic growth and margin expansion despite soft markets and significant currency headwinds. But as you look at this quarter's performance in the aggregate for the company, it represents another strong quarter with 8% organic growth, record operating margin levels that expanded 70 basis points in the face of 80 basis points of year-over-year currency headwinds. Our management team continues to execute at a high level, overcoming numerous external obstacles, including the strong dollar and dynamic end markets to produce exceptional results. With that, I'll turn it over to Don Allan.
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim. Good morning. I’d like to start by spending a little bit time on our second quarter and year-to-date free cash flow performance. For the second quarter, free cash flow was $247 million, which brings us to a relatively neutral performance on a year-to-date basis. The quarterly and the year-to-date declines versus the prior year are explained by carrying higher amounts of inventory compared to last year to service the increased levels of organic growth we are experiencing, primarily within Tools & Storage business. We do, however, continue to realize benefits from applying our core SFS process and principles. And for the second quarter, we achieved seven working capital turns, which was two times of a turn expansion versus the prior year. We are confident that we will deliver a continued improvement in 2015 towards our vision of 10 plus working capital turns for the company. We will continue to monitor the working capital levels closely to ensure they are adequate to support our higher growth expectations for the full year. The core SFS principles require agility to respond when business conditions change such as the strong organic growth we've experienced in the last four quarters. SFS has enabled us to reach working capital on asset efficiency levels that are considered world-class compared to our Industrial and Security peers, but at the same time allowing us to be agile in changing market conditions to ensure we meet our customers’ needs. I’d also like to spend a little bit of time and give you a quick update on our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we executed cash repurchases of approximately $100 million. Taking into account all the actions to date, this brings the cumulative total share actions to the equivalent of approximately $1 billion, which fully achieves our plan announced back in the fourth quarter of 2013. As we reviewed during our Investor Day in May, you should expect us to return over time to a capital allocation of approximately 50% of our free cash flow being deployed to M&A and the remaining 50% back to our shareholders via dividend or the occasional optimistic share repurchase. So let’s move to page 10 and spend a little bit of time on the 2015 outlook. As indicated by John earlier, we are increasing the 2015 EPS guidance range to $5.70 to $5.90 versus the previous range of $5.65 to $5.85. This is due to stronger organic growth as well as additional indirect cost savings, which will be partially reduced by slower margin improvement trajectory within Security. So let’s walk through a little bit of the detailed around these assumptions to provide a level of information that leads to a $0.05 increase to the midpoint of our prior outlook guidance range. First, we expect organic growth to be approximately 6% versus our prior expectations of approximately 5%. This change recognizes the strong organic growth momentum that continues with our Tools & Storage business. Additionally, we are increasing our expectation modestly within Engineered Fastening due to the solid first half trends within that business. These improve growth expectations, combined with all of our other businesses tracking to their planned organic growth rates results in an overall improved performance for 2015. This overall improved growth performance contributes an incremental $0.15 EPS impact over and above the EPS benefit that was included in our guidance last quarter. The next item I’d like to touch on is the work we’ve been doing on our indirect cost savings programs across the company that continue to yield benefit throughout 2015. This should contribute approximately an additional $0.05 of EPS benefit versus our last quarter's guidance as well. So the total of those two items contribute $0.20 in positive momentum versus our April guidance. Finally, we now expect a slower trajectory of margin improvement within Security, due primarily to the North American electronics project mix matter that was described by Jim earlier. This represents a headwind of approximately $0.15 of EPS for 2015 versus our April guidance assumptions. All the other planning assumptions within guidance, including FX, tax rate, shares and restructuring costs remain the same. But I would like to spend a little time discussing FX, but there has been various movements in currency over the past few months. However, based on the present spot rates this week, our current estimate of 2015 versus the prior year is still within our April range of $200 million to $220 million. Significant movements in the British pound, the euro, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real over the past few months have netted to a relatively neutral impact versus that April estimate. A few other key items of note relative to our annual EPS guidance that you should be aware of. The first item is restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2015, will approximate 30% of the full year expectation of $50 million. There is some timing shift from the second quarter into the third quarter for several key actions. The second item is related to the third quarter as well. I have a few comments that I want you to understand related the timing for the back half of the year. First, we obviously expect higher planned restructuring charges in the third quarter versus our April estimate, as well as a higher tax rate in that quarter as well. Combining that with the significant currency headwind, this will result in the third quarter EPS of approximately 24% to 25% of the full year EPS estimate. Another factor to consider when you look at the third quarter is the operating margin rate. It will be relatively flat versus the prior year, as we experienced the largest quarterly impact of currency headwinds during this quarter, which is estimated at this point to be approximately $75 million. Let’s turn to segments on the right side of the page. We expect high single-digit organic revenue growth, solid operating margin expansion year-over-year in the Tools & Storage segment, due to the volume leverage, cost actions, price and other significant positive actions that Jim touched on earlier in his commentary, which will more than offset the significant currency headwind we are experiencing in that business. Organic growth is expected to decelerate slightly in the back half on more difficult comparables but still will be at very healthy levels. Moving to our Security segment, we still expect to have modest organic growth for the full year. The organic growth in Security North America will compliment an improving performance in Security Europe, which continued its good momentum in the second quarter as you heard from Jim. This growth will be partially offset by declines within the China markets, as we continue to see some pressure in that part of the business. Profitability will be relatively flat versus the prior year as Security Europe will deliver solid year-over-year profit growth and North America mechanical will have healthy volume leverage. However, these improvements are being offset by negative North America electronics project mix as well as lower volumes within China. As Jim stated earlier on the call and we have stated previously several times, the multi-year growth in margin rates recovery trajectory of this business will not necessarily be linear. And we will have occasional timing dynamics to work through resulting from the ongoing transformational activities. Now moving to Industrial, we still expect solid mid-single-digit organic growth as Engineered Fastening strengths will be able to move -- to more than offset the declines in our infrastructure business. We also expect margins to be flat to up versus prior year as volume leverage generated by Engineered Fastening and cost controls will more than offset the deleveraging impact of both of our infrastructure businesses due to the sluggish market conditions that were touched upon by Jim. In summary, our revised EPS guidance range demonstrates the impact of our organic growth strength, combined with indirect cost savings, which are more than offsetting the slower margin improvement trajectory within Security. Therefore, we will achieve solid operating margin leverage and a robust organic growth even with significant currency headwinds, which means, we expect earnings will expand 6% to 10% on an overall revenue decline of approximately 1% in 2015. The last thing to touch on this page is related to our free cash outlook for the year, which we still anticipate be at least a $1 billion. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are monitoring the relatively higher levels of working capital experienced in first half of the year to ensure our working capital is adequate to service the higher organic growth expectations for the full year. This dynamic could put modest pressure on our free cash estimates for 2015. So let’s summarize the presentation portion of our call today. We delivered a very strong first half for the year and here are some of the highlights. We are very pleased with another quarter of strong organic growth, our fourth in a row, at or above 6%. The proactive tight cost controls, surgical price actions across the company enabled excellent second quarter operating leverage in the face of $50 million currency headwinds. Progress continues with Security’s multiyear transformation with favorable results in the European electronic and North America mechanical businesses. And then finally, our share count actions we have taken since the start of the fourth quarter of 2014 have effectively satisfied the approximately $1 billion of share reduction plans that we announced in November of 2013. As we communicated during our Investor Day in May, our focus in 2015 and beyond will be leveraging our world-class franchises and brands, strong free cash flow generation and continued shareholder friendly capital allocation. This continues to manifest itself through our focus on accelerating organic growth through SFS 2.0, advancing our Security multiyear transformation, so the portfolio review of this business is fit by the second half of 2016. Continue our disciplined approach to cost and pricing actions to ensure operating leverage is achieved. And ongoing focus on working capital towards our 10 plus returns goal and finally resuming M&A activity likely in the second half of 2015, with a focus on Tools & Storage and our Engineered Fastening franchises. We believe this approach will help position our company to deliver on the 2018 financial objectives we communicated back in May. That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Now let’s go to Q&A.
Greg Waybright: Great. Thanks. Thanks Don. Amanda, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Tim Wojs: Yeah. Hey guys. Great job.
John Lundgren: Thanks Tim.
Tim Wojs: I guess just starting I guess my question’s more in the Tools & Storage business. Could you just talk about maybe what you are seeing from a DIY and Professional Power Tools end customer standpoint? And you’re starting to see I guess on the professional side -- are you starting to see employment come back in construction? Is that really a multiyear trend that will really benefit growth as we think about the next couple of years?
John Lundgren: Yes. Hey, Tim, this is John. It’s a complex answer and that it varies a lot by geography. And I think that’s the only point I want to leave you with. The trends in the US are good. As demonstrated by the numbers that Jim walked you through, we’re seeing more end users, we’re seeing both online purchases, purchases through the two step channel, professional purchases through the big box, all good. You see or large customer’s numbers, at the same time we do. They are nicely 5% to 7%, and of course we’re above double that rate. So we are gaining share. Now that being said, and that’s 50% as you know, or 52% of our revenue is in North America. Europe is relatively flat. So our organic growth in Europe is representing growth of 2, 3, 4 times the rate of the market. It certainly hit bottom. We don’t see it getting any worse. But in Europe, it’s far from robust. And the rest of the world, I think Jim talked about it pretty nicely. There are certain emerging markets, China and Russia way down, China relatively flat, the rest of the world doing okay. But in the North American market, we are cautiously optimistic that the signs are positive. They could be better, but they are certainly more positive than they have been. That shows up in our customer’s numbers and it certainly shows up in our numbers. So that’s helping us maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. The phenomenal performance in tools and storages forces me to a question on security. So North American conversion, can you just elaborate a little bit more on what’s going on there? Is there an issue of not pricing properly for complexity? Or is there an issue of just kind of experience and competency on bigger jobs and kind of a learning curve? Any additional color there would be helpful.
Jim Loree: It’s Jim. I think the issue is more of a learning curve issue. It’s also a little bit of an organizational issue in terms of how exactly, how we’re organized and the types of people we have experience, the level of experience that we have with people installing these very complex jobs, because we’re getting into highly engineered solutions with Internet of things and software. And it’s much more complex than the typical historical access control and intrusion type systems that we used to have. So there is a learning curve there and there is also a bit of a talent kind of training and development issue. Now pricing, I think we’re gaining experience on pricing. We are creating a lot of value with many of these solutions and some of the verticals we are doing a really job capturing the price, the value in the form of price and then some of the other verticals. We need to improve it as well. So I think we will see continued progress in terms of the moving up the learning curve, but it’s not an overnight kind of a process.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.
David MacGregor: Yes. Congratulations on a great quarter as well. In security, you talked last quarter about seeing an increased order rate and then that came through strongly this quarter and now you’re talking about seeing the ordering rate in Europe continuing to grow. I guess the question is really just, what’s the rate of growth you’re seeing in those orders? Does that order growth have a long tail or do those orders come through much more immediately?
Jim Loree: The order growth definitely has a long tail. It typically averages about six months in terms of its tail and the backlog is growing in North America and in Europe, it is growing as well, I would say growing even more in North America. The European folks are doing a better job efficiently installing the backlog. North American folks have a growing backlog and have the opportunity to install at a faster rate, but are experiencing some learning curve issues as we just discussed. So it’s all encouraging from an order rate perspective and we just need to do a better job in North America on the installation side.
John Lundgren: Yes, David. This is John. Just to add on because it ties into a Jeff’s question earlier and I think Jeff, you are on the right track and Jim I think explained very well what it is. Within that long tail, you have a mix of obviously size of projects as well as margins. And in appropriate world, we installed a higher margin projects first, which is not always an option, obviously given contractual commitments and customer needs. But it’s one of the more difficult businesses when we just look at open orders or backlog to forecast that on a quarterly basis because the sixth plus months of time to get these things install. So Jeff’s earlier question and yours are right on. I think Jim described it is as accurately as we are able to. And we continue to learn more about it everyday and we’re getting better everyday at both prioritization, pricing, cost estimating, and it’s all part of a learning curve to which Jim spoke.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Robert Barry: Hey, guys. Good morning.
John Lundgren: Good morning.
Robert Barry: I wondered if you could comment on the benefit to industrial revenue and margin in the quarter from the large oil and gas equipment sale. And then more broadly, what is your outlook for the oil and gas or infrastructure business? Thank you.
Don Allan: Sure. This is Don. I will take that one. We did -- as Jim mentioned, we did have a large order in the second quarter associated with equipment, which does happen occasionally in this business and particularly in the Far East. We do get an occasional situation whether the large pipeline being constructed and we are just primarily selling equipment and then training them on how to use the equipment effectively in the construction process. Those things range from occurrence from anywhere from 6 to 12 months occasion they happen, but they are very sporadic. And we don’t end to plan for those types of sales. And I think it’s just happened to occur in the month of June, which we’re all very pleased to see. As far as our outlook of oil and gas, I mean which continues to be similar to what we’ve been saying for the last almost year now where the level of activity of construction of pipeline is really on the onshore really not existing at this stage. There continues to be a lot of activity within the industry about the potential kind of ramp up of activity in 2016. We have not seen specific quotes within that nature of the stage that would give us a high level of confidence, but then we’ve also seen a downturn lately in the oil prices as well. So there is still volatility in this space, but ultimately we do feel that we are going to see some type of ramp up in activity in the next 12 to 18 months of pipeline construction, because there is a great deal of pent-up volume that needs to be dealt with and have to take to the stage.
John Lundgren: We are also seeing on the oil and gas onshore. It’s the onshore business that looks like it might get some legs next year, because we are doing a lot of prep work with specifications right now. Our concern is and the reason Don is very circumspect about it is, because there is a good chance that these types of projects will get delayed if the oil prices don’t recover. And again, the gas prices are also a factor here because the onshore market is about 70% gas. The offshore market, which is another big piece of our business, doesn’t look to be too favorable anytime soon. So it’s kind of a mixed bag and we expect probably double-digit declines in the oil and gas for the next couple of quarters, and then we will see what happens when the comps get easier and the activity picks up.
Jim Loree: The other thing I would want to just go back on the first part of the question just to make sure people don’t get a view that this order was a huge impact to the second quarter. The impact at margin, the profit for EPS was less than $0.02 of EPS in the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Your line is open.
Grace Lee: So this is Grace Lee sitting in for Jeremie Capron. Congratulations on a good quarter. We hear quite a broad-based trend in automotives end market. Could you give us a more color around engineered fastening? In which market do you see the strongest growth? And also how would you envision the growth trajectory going forward?
Jim Loree: Well, when you say which market, I mean, we generally…
Grace Lee: Geographically.
Jim Loree: Yes, geographically, okay. So Asia was -- we’re generally outpacing light vehicle production wherever we are operating geographically. I will say that I think the North American and European markets were a little stronger than the Asian markets in this particular quarter, but it’s all over the map in terms of quarterly -- quarter-to-quarter. So it’s -- I would say that it’s -- our growth is not -- is less market related and more just penetration of platform, lot of platforms as we go here, but we do consider, although overall production was about flat for the global light vehicle. So it wasn’t a particularly strong quarter at all for the market.
John Lundgren: And our long-term view of that business answering the second half your question is that we think it’s a business that fits into our long-term organic growth vision of 4% to 6%. And it’s demonstrated a good track record to be within that range. And as it adopts more of the commercial excellence activities and innovation activities, that’s 2.0, we think that will only assist in that ability to continue that on a long-term basis.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Deepa Raghavan: Good morning. This is Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. Two questions. Two parts to it. Oil and gas business, I know you mentioned 11% organic growth spike -- from one-time spike, but could you share with us what the revenue growth for the total industrials would have been on an organic basis ex this spike? And also what the margin number might have been ex this one-time item? I am just trying to squarer up these strong margins you printed this quarter with the forecast. Second one.
Don Allan: I will make it very clear. It was $7 million of revenue and $3.5 million of operation margin.
John Lundgren: Which translates to less than $0.02 a share due to the large relatively large for oil and gas, it’s less than a $300 million business. So when you get a $7 million order shipped in the quarter, that’s large on a very small base on our $2 billion plus industrial segment base or $1.7 billion engineered fastening base. However, if you want to look at it within oil and gas, it was large; within the segment, it was tiny.
Don Allan: And then just for analytical purposes, we understand why you’re trying to get to a run rate, but please don’t think of it as a one-time item because it’s part of the ongoing discussion.
John Lundgren: As we said many times as it relates to oil and gas, it’s one of our few businesses, infrastructure in general, and oil and gas in particular where it’s a long cycle business with large lumpy orders, unlike our Global Tools and Storage business and even a security business the way we install and recognize revenue. You get large orders and depending on when they are fulfilled in a quarter has tremendous variations. So it’s one of our few businesses where quarter-to-quarter the numbers can vary dramatically due simply to timing.
Jim Loree: And as I said earlier an answer to the first question, we’ve seen this roughly every six to nine months. We have sometimes as large order like this, so it’s not a one-time item. Maybe one time in a specific quarter, but when you look at a year, you can have one to two of these and even occasionally three that happen every year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Liam Burke: Yes. Thank you. In the tools and storage business, you talked partially about the construction. Outside the construction, both on the industrial and on MAC tools, how those markets have been for you?
John Lundgren: Well, the markets have generally been good in terms of MAC tools and markets. As you looked at some of the numbers that come out, they’ve been very good. The statistics very recently published in the last 10 years in the U.S., which is overwhelmingly where MAC tools is of course. Car ownership, the average age of cars on the road has gone from slightly under nine to slightly over 11 years, which means cars have been built better, but it also means they’re on the road longer and so there is a generally healthy environment for automotive repair and automotive aftermarket. That’s clearly helping MAC. What’s also helping MAC is just the benefit of it been part of our Global Tools & Storage business with a great product development, product introduction, good sales rhythm, good forecasting. A lot of the newer cars of course require a lot of diagnostics and something where we’re relatively underdeveloped compared to some of the competition. But in general, Liam, those markets are healthy. And we benefited from that, but we clearly believe we are growing faster than those end markets, which implies share gain of course.
Jim Loree: On the industrial side, clearly, there is a big differentiation within industrial markets by segment. And so the oil and gas issues within industrial marketplace are weighing on growth. We got ag laying on growth and mining as well and hydraulics. So, mixed bag in industry, I would say the MRO channel is little weaker than it has been, maybe inventories are little higher, we’re not sure about that, but it feels that way. We don’t have great data on the MRO channel. It seems like there might -- won’t call it a correction, but sort of an inventory build maybe going on there. So in general, the industrial markets are a little weaker than they have been over the last year or so.
Operator: And next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open.
Stephen Kim: Yes. Thanks very much guys. Strong quarter. I guess a couple of questions, but let me just ask one. Essentially, this quarter in terms of guidance, you are talking about your year coming in about $0.20 better, due to the, frankly, organic growth and then I guess $0.15 headwind due to the security issues that have been discussed. I guess I'm curious as to what happened in the quarter. If you could give us a sense for how much better the organic growth in terms of cents in that same basis, $0.20 and that was the $0.15. If you could give us a sense for what happened in the quarter in those two buckets? How much better was the organic growth in terms of cents and how much worse was the security, relative to your expectations going-in in the quarter? Thanks.
Don Allan: I’ll take that. This is Don. I think our organic growth was about two points better in the second quarter versus beginning of the quarter expectation and most of that was driven as you might imagine in Tools & Storage, a little bit an Engineered Fastening. Our EPS level, how does it play out $0.20 versus $0.15? I mean, the way, my view would be, security was about $0.03 to $0.05 off expectation in the second quarter and you can do the math the rest of the way. But clearly, Tools and Storage outperformance, depending on how you look at our outperformance of the company, we look at the vast majority of that $0.10 as an operational outperformance and a lot of that’s being driven by Tools & Storage. There is some plusses and minuses below operating margin but the bulk of that is next to zero. And really what you’re looking at is a $0.05 to $0.08 operational outperformance, but if you factor that $0.03 to $0.05 in, then Tools & storage was somewhere around $0.08 to $0.10, or $0.12 outperformance.
John Lundgren: Tools & Storage plus industrial.
Don Allan: Plus industrial. Thank you, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Mike Sang: Hey. Good morning guys. It’s Mike Sang for Nigel. A few comments on how the quarter phased? I mean, we’re getting conflicting data points with oil and gas over dipping and [indiscernible] is volatile and I think even construction has been a little bit lumpy. So if you could talk about growth ex in June and how that’s trending to July that would be great? I’m just trying to get a feel for back half of this facility? Thanks.
Don Allan: This is Don. I’ll take that one. We -- actually when you look at the second quarter, we saw a pretty balance level of growth across the quarter, especially in Tools -- actually in all our business. As we look at all our businesses, we saw relatively healthy growth in all our businesses in each point of month across the quarter. And so we didn't see an accelerating trend or a decelerating trend in the month of June. Our guidance is reflective. Obviously, we feel good with what we’ve experienced in the first half of the year and the momentum as we exited the first half of the year, which allowed us to increase our organic growth assumption of 5% to 6%. So, we’re clearly seeing trends that make us feel at least, reasonably good about the market. We will be the first one to admit. There is a lot of conflicting data and information out there across the construction and industrial phase as to what might happen in the back half of the year. And as a result, we’ve evaluated that combined with a very healthy organic growth performance in the first half. I think we’ve put forth a very balanced view of the full year.
John Lundgren: And just to add briefly do that. I think as Jim pointed out in his piece of the presentation, our largest business obviously is within GT&S, Global Tools & Storage. It’s where we have the best data. Inventories are at or slightly below normal levels that bodes well for the future. That’s partially offset by relatively weak industrial markets compared to what we’d like to see. But simply said, a very smooth quarter and a very good position in terms of inventories at the customer level, which has led to our guiding the second half of the year the way we have versus importantly, if you look at the details, some very, very steep and difficult comps, but keep that in mind as you look forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.
Mike Wood: Hi. Congratulations on the organic growth.
John Lundgren: Thank you.
Mike Wood: My question was on the Security business. You return to the organic growth in Europe. Can you give us some color in terms of what the margin range is now, the improvement in Europe? And is that -- is your decision on what action you’re going to take in security, dependent upon the execution of the business or the valuation kind of how that parses out within family? Thank you.
Don Allan: As far as, Europe goes, as Jim mentioned in a nice level of detail that the business continues to progress forward. It’s turned the corner in the sense of organic growth over the last two or three quarters. We’re starting to demonstrate modest level of 3% in the second quarter, which we're pleased with. The profitability continues to improve. It’s still in the range of mid to high-single digits and as it exit this year, it will certainly be at the high single-digit level as it continues to progress in the back half of the year through its transformation. So, we really -- and that’s really what we’ve communicated in the past, so it’s consistently performing with our expectation. As far as, our view as to our decision associated with the fit in the portfolio, it will be a combination of factors to evaluate. And certainly, the one that, probably, drives the most, a largest part of decision will be valuation and if the valuation improves based on a certain outcome that we make related to that decision. And ultimately, we believe we’re here to drive shareholder value over the long-term and if we think whatever decision we make is going to achieve that result that will be a big driver of decision. Certainly, evaluating how its performing is a factor but I don't think it’s the primary one.
John Lundgren: Yeah. Let me -- this is John. Let me just add to that. I certainly agree with everything Don said. But as we’ve had a lot of focus again on the 15% of our business that’s performing slightly below our line average specifically. So, I think, Jim pointed out European security and North American conversion. We’re focused on improving the performance. But I think it's fairly important just to note that while it’s -- that subsegment of that segment are performing at a level slightly below our [OM] [ph] average. They’re performing right in the middle of fair way, relative to their peers. This is not a broken business. It’s the business that’s performing not as well as it has in the past. There is some industry trends, as well as some internal executional issues that Jim spoke about I think in great detail. I guess, I just -- we need to be on record. This is not a broken business. It’s a good business. It's been better and it will be better going forward. And our assessment of it will be based on both the trends that as Don said, we’re here to create shareholder value. That’s ultimately going to be the driver this time next year as we zero in on it fit in our portfolio relative to elsewhere.
Operator: Thank you. And I’ll now turn the call back over to Greg for closing remarks.
Greg Waybright: Amanda, thanks. We’d like to thank everyone again calling in this morning and for your participation in the call and obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q1 2015 Stanley Black & Decker Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is John and I’ll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I’ll now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. You may begin.
Gregory Waybright: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's first quarter 2015 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review our fourth quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we’re going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John Lundgren: Thanks, Greg, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We’ve got a strong quarter and I think a lot of encouraging news that we’re very much looking forward to sharing with you and then taking your questions. During the quarter, revenue expanded 8% organically. Total growth was 1% as the topline impact of foreign currency was negative 7% in the quarter. Our Tools, Storage and Engineered Fastening businesses all continued strong momentum. They both grew in the double digits organically and Security built up the momentum from the fourth quarter and posted 2% organic growth as North America and emerging markets as well as Europe grew organically within the quarter. I won’t dwell on those numbers because Jim is going to dive into much more detail on the segments in just a minute. Both gross and operating margin rates expanded in the first quarter, 50 basis points in gross margin and 120 basis points in operating margins. They increased due to higher volume, along with sharp cost focus and price realization delivering operating leverage, despite $50 million of foreign currency pressure just within the quarter. Earnings per share were $1.07, the same number versus flat in the first quarter of 2014 as the strong business performance most notably in Tools and Storage, offset higher plant restructuring and tax rate. Due in part to our strong fourth quarter cash flow in conjunction with our previously communicated equity derivatives, we executed repurchase actions that reduced the share count by approximately eight million shares in the first quarter. This was a meaningful acceleration versus our prior plan.  We are also reiterating full year 2015 guidance for earnings in the range of $5.65 to $5.85 on a GAAP basis. That’s inclusive of $0.25 a share in restructuring charges. It represents a 5% to 9% year over year EPS growth, despite $60 to $70 million of incremental foreign exchange pressure since our last report and it’s now expected to total between $200 million and $220 million in 2015. We are also reiterating free cash flow outlook of at least $1 billion. Don is going to walk you through the moving pieces and our assumptions around them with respect to the share repurchase, currency impact and cash flow in just a few minutes.  Moving to the next slide and looking where the growth came from. The momentum continues in the developed markets and that’s been led by the US. As they say, another solid quarter of organic growth, but with currency headwinds almost two times what we experienced during the fourth quarter of 2014. The organic growth of 8% came on the heels of 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Over the last eight quarters, our organic growth has averaged 5%, right in the midpoint of our targeted 4% to 6% range.  Strong volume growth, particularly in the US, but we also had solid growth in every other region of the country as you can see in the box on the right. Pricing was again positive in the quarter, as actions to combat currency primarily in the emerging markets, but also surgical pricing actions across the remainder of our businesses are contributing to the organic growth. Currency headwinds did intensify as we moved through the quarter. They ramped up toward the end of the quarter and they did dampen the organic performance by 7% as I previously said as the dollar strengthened against almost every currency in countries where we do business. Don is going to give you a very granular look at that in his portion of the presentation.  Just quickly on a regional basis, demand in the US remains very healthy, particularly in retail, both strong sell-in and sell-through in the industrial channel, as well as within our security business. Europe has been a very pleasant surprise as we continue to show strong share gains, most notably in Tools and Storage, as well as our industrial business. As you can see, total organic growth is 6%, with these markets tracking flat to slightly up, maybe in low single digits. Finally, the Emerging markets were aided by strong shipments in our Engineered Fastening, Automotive and Electronics businesses, while certain markets, most notably Russia, remain under a lot of pressure.  Let’s move it over to Jim and he can give you a lot of detail on the segments. 
James Loree: Thank you, John. I think this first quarter performance on the heels of a very strong showing in 2014 is indicative, not only of how far we have come in pursuit of exceptional value creation, but also how much potential there is ahead of us. The title of our opening slide this morning is, Accelerating Organic Growth and Margin Expansion. That is a topic we are very excited about here as a company. A record 8% organic growth is notable considering that the US is one of the only major world economies with legs. European economic growth is still spotty at best and emerging markets in the aggregate are weak and getting slightly weaker.  120 basis point operating margin expansion speaks clearly to the underlying operational strength and volume leverage potential of the company, especially reviewed in the context of overcoming well over 100 basis points of year-over-year currency headwinds. Our ability to upgrade total year organic growth guidance to 5% and hold EPS guidance in the 5% to 9% growth range despite total FX headwinds of between $1 to $1.10 a share, means that the underlying organic EPS growth of the company for 2015 is expected to be somewhere between 25% and 30%. Our global tools franchise is on a tear, gaining share and hitting on virtually all cylinders. Our large, highly profitable Engineered Fastening business, has fully digested the successful Infastech acquisition and is growing at rates well above market. Security is now generating positive, albeit modest organic growth and is tracking to previously communicated improvement benchmarks and thus offers more in the way of future value creation upside than downside.  Overall we emerged from Q1 2015 with strong operating momentum and conviction that despite one of the tougher operating environments in recollections, we can continue to perform well. In a few minutes I will conclude my section with some commentary on how we plan to keep the growth and operating margin expansion momentum going, but first I will provide some color on segment level performance, starting with Tools and Storage, which offered up another outstanding quarter.  Total Tools and Storage revenue was up 3% and operating margins grew 21% to 15.7%, demonstrating impressive operating leverage. Gains resulted from volume leverage, modestly positive price, operations productivity and tight SG&A cost management, which more than offset the severe currency headwinds. Organic growth was again in double digit territory, this time 10%. North America was up 15%, Europe once again delivered outsized growth, in this case up 9% organically. Emerging markets were flat as 9% growth in Latin America was wiped out by a steep greater than 50% decline in Russia and minus 8% in Asia, as softness in China prevailed. The mid-price point product rollout continues to proceed well and this important initiative provided support for the emerging market organic revenues and prevented them from contraction in the quarter.  Across Global Tools and Storage, organic strength was broad-based once again, with Professional Power Tools up 13%, Consumer Power Tools up 10%, Accessories up 13% and Hand Tools and Storage up 7%. All categories benefited from strong new product introduction momentum and customer level execution. POS and major box customers in the US was robust despite less than ideal weather conditions and aggregate weeks in hand decrease during the quarter. We believe sell-through in the hardware lumber store and staff channels was also very strong as both resi and non-resi construction markets benefited from good growth in end user demand. Industrial markets in the US were somewhat weaker than we saw in 2014, but still positive. Our best guess is that the total US tool market was up about 5% including power tools, which we believe was up a slightly higher rate, maybe 7%. The European market, as measured in local currency, continued to be soft, perhaps up a point or two. In the developed markets, we believe we continued our share gain momentum during the quarter.  As Tools and Storage, which was previously known as CDIY and IAR recently combined, continues to rack up gains now in its combined form, the question we often get is what exactly is management doing to drive the performance? The simple answer is we are taking a great asset, feeding the new product innovation machine and coupling it with outstanding commercial and supply chain execution. By combining Stanley and Black and Decker five years ago, we created the world’s leading tool company with power tools, hand tools, storage and accessories as well as a broad array of leading brands, global scale and the only tool company in the world with meaningful presence across all four major channels, construction, DIY, industrial and automotive repair.  We executed the integration well, extracting over $500 million of cost synergies and greatly exceeding our original targets for both cost and revenue synergies. Most importantly, we fused these companies together by creating a winning culture with both an innovation growth orientation and operational discipline enabled by the Stanley fulfillment system. What we are experiencing today in terms of performance is the manifestation of all the above. It was a great idea on paper. In practice, it is exceeding our expectations. We look forward to delving more deeply into this story as well as offering insight into how we plan to keep the growth going with those of you who are interested at our upcoming Analyst Day on May 15.  Now moving to security, it was a modestly successful in line quarter for security, which registered 2% organic growth and 110 basis points of operating margin rate accretion while facing an overall 6% revenue decline as FX took its toll. Nonetheless, operating margin was up 4%. North America and emerging markets revenue was up 2% organically and Europe was up 1% on the same basis. Notably, the European team delivered the first organic growth quarter for this unit since Niscayah was acquired in 2011. This came on the heels of a flat organic growth performance in 4Q 2014.  During several 2014 investor conference calls, we foreshadowed that the next marker in the European turn around would be shifting from negative organic growth to modestly positive growth, something we expected to occur sometime in 2015. Having first wrestled the European attrition to rates within our targets range of 10% to 12% during the first half of 2014, as of 1Q 2015, we have stabilized the value of our recurring revenue portfolio and are now in a position to achieve positive overall European security organic growth and a prospective basis. The benefit of revenue stabilization was clear in the quarter as the team delivered its internal operating margin commitment, a $4 million increase over prior year. Late last week, I visited with them in London and I can say that they’re fully grounded in what they have to do to continue the positive trend and they have both the substance and the strength of conviction to back it up. I will look for continued progress on that front.  The other really positive turnaround news in security was the commercial lock business in North America with delivered 4% organic growth, their first positive growth quarters since fully converting to the independent distribution model in early 2013. And also on a positive note, Automatic Doors continued along its strong growth trajectory.  In summary now, two full quarters into the leadership adjustment in both Europe and North America, the early returns are promising. Both units are poised to deliver improving organic revenue and operating margin results while continuing their recent track record of predictability. And as I mentioned last quarter, we expect the overall security recovery to be slow and steady during the next several quarters, but we do expect it to continue to gain momentum as 2015 progress.  Now turning to industrial. Industrial had a mixed quarter, with an outstanding performance from Engineered Fastening, the largest part of it, offset by market related issues in oil and gas. The net result was a 2% decrease in revenue with 6% organic growth. But oil and gas deleveraging and FX pressures decreased operating margins by $12 million or 14%, bringing the rate down 210 basis points to a still respectable 15.3%. Engineered Fastening achieved a very strong 12% organic growth, including a plus 20% performance in the automotive sector, aided by strong equipment and fastener growth. This was in contrast to global light vehicle production, which was up 1%. With about two thirds of their business overseas, FX wiped out 10 points of Engineered Fastening revenue growth. So their total revenue was up only 2%. Nonetheless, they achieved both absolute margin growth and rate accretion. Infrastructure, which includes oil and gas and hydraulic, was down 15%. Oil and gas, approximately 2% of total company revenues, was down 23% organically as the market related contraction in pipeline activity depressed the topline. All in all, a solid operational performance by the Engineered Fastening team mitigated, but could not completely offset the OM pressure from both the market related issues in oil and gas and currency.  There were a lot of moving parts to our total company first quarter story, but the punch line is 8% organic growth with 120 basis points of OM expansion, while overcoming well over 100 basis points of year over year currency headwinds. Clearly this management team is executing in a high level despite numerous external obstacles, with the biggest being the strong dollar. We have confidence in our total year outlook that we will continue to overcome these obstacles and deliver. However, a natural question from the investment community is, what’s next? We plan to answer that question for both the total company and for its individual parts on May 15 during our Investor Day at our Tools and Storage headquarters in Towson, Maryland. An important part of the story will be a deep dive into the Stanley fulfillment system 2.0, otherwise known as SFS 2.0. This is an initiative which we have been quietly working on for over a year. It is the next chapter in the evolution of SFS, which many of you know is a key element of our culture and has been for over eight years. SFS has enabled us to achieve a high level of customer facing supply chain execution and working capital efficiency, as well as generating well over a billion dollars of free cash flow since its inception. SFS 2.0 is the next generation of that business system, which focuses on fueling additional organics growth and margin expansion in the coming years.  It is an exciting set of initiatives which provides us with a clear path to differentiated out performance, leveraging off the base that we have already created. The initiatives are listed on this slide. It starts with core SFS, which is simply a continuation of what we have been doing for years, supplemented by four new elements; Digital Excellent, Breakthrough Innovation, Commercial Excellence and Functional Transformation. We will provide greater insight into these elements as well as business strategies, portfolio strategy and acquisition criteria as well as capital allocation and financial objectives at the upcoming May Investor Day. With that, I'll turn it over to Don Allan, our CFO for his comments.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. I’m going to start by spending a little time on our first quarter free cash flow performance, which was an outflow of $243 million. This was relatively consistent with prior year and typical of normal seasonality that we see in our company where our inventory levels rise, especially in the Tools and Storage business to ensure we’re adequately prepared for Q2 and Q3 demands of key customers, in particular in a mature or developed market. However, the incremental investment we made in Tools and Storage inventory during the first quarter of this year was modestly higher than normal as we managed through the west coast port strike and we prepared for strong organics growth to re-occur in the second quarter of this year.  The core SFS principle Jim just mentioned require agility to respond when business conditions change, such as strong organic growth such as we have experienced over the last three quarters. SFS has enabled us to reach working capital and asset efficiency levels that are considered world class compared to other industrial and security peers. SFS continues to assist us on our journey to 10 times working capital turns. But we want to ensure that we are agile in changing market conditions, just like we saw over the last few quarters.  Due to our confidence in our ability to generate at least $1 billion of free cash flow during 2015, as John mentioned, we were able to accelerate our share repurchase activity relating to our repurchase program that we announced at the end of 2013. By using a mixture of cash repurchases and equity derivatives, we took actions to lower the share count by roughly 8 million shares within the first quarter and 9.6 million shares since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. This brings our cumulative total share actions to the equivalent of approximately $900 million for the program that we announced in the fourth quarter of 2013.  Moving to page 11, as John touched on and as all of us are well aware, another significant weakening of currencies versus the US dollar occurred during February and March of this year. Given this shift, I would like to spend a few minute updating you on our 2015 foreign current impact. For us, it resulted in significant incremental currency pressure, most notably from movements in the Brazilian Real, many other Latin American currencies and several other currencies that moved in concert with the Euro. The result of these fluctuations has created a total negative annual impact of $200 million to $220 million versus 2014, which in an incremental headwind of $60 million to $70 million versus what we communicated during our earnings call in January. As a remainder, these amounts are net of our derivative hedging activities.  The incremental currency headwinds of $60 million to $70 million have been broad based and in fact out top exposures in the Brazilian Real, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Argentinian Peso, represent only approximately $30 million of this incremental impact, with two thirds of that $30 million impact due specifically to the Brazilian Real. This demonstrates the positive impact of our Euro and Canadian dollar hedging program in 2015. As you may recall, I spoke of increased hedges on the Euro and Canadian dollar in January and while those currencies moved negatively during the first quarter, much of that impact was mitigated by these hedges. The remaining portion of the $60 million to $70 million incremental headwind from currency is caused by exposures in approximately 20 countries around the world, which clearly demonstrates the broad based nature of this currency movement. As we have reviewed during past calls, we attempt to mitigate these currency impacts in our P&L beyond what we do in hedging activities through a multi-stepped approach. The first is pursuing customer pricing increases where large transactional FX headwinds emerge due to importing of US dollar-based products or components specifically into countries such as Canada, Brazil and even parts of Europe.  The second area of focus is we focus on improving our cost base thought he pursuit of likely commodity deflation in this environment, which we have been seeing in the last three to six months as well as we evaluate pulling forward certain specific cost rationalization projects for selected businesses and function to ensure that we try to offset this impact. And then the last area which we can never lose sight of is the long term pursuit of increasing our localized production and component supply in certain key emerging markets around the world to minimize this impact. So in summary on this page, we continue to activity manage a difficult currency environment with a proactive approach that has enabled us to manage near time volatility, but at the same time balancing the requirement of continuing to invest for future growth.  Let’s move to page 12 and talk about 2015 EPS outlook. As indicated by John and Jim’s comments earlier, we are reiterating 2015 guidance as $5.65 to $5.85 EPS and free cash flow of at least $1 billion as the strong organic growth performance in Tools and Storage, combined with an acceleration of our share repurchase actions, has allowed us to offset the incremental currency headwinds that I just described. Let’s walk through these assumptions which led to a neutral impact on our guidance in all more detail.  First, we expect organic growth to be approximately 5% versus our prior expectation of 3% to 4%. This change recognizes the strong organic growth momentum that emerged in the second half of 2014 with our Tools and Storage business, which we expect to continue for the coming months. Additionally, as we saw in the first quarter, our two other segments are generally on track to their planned organic growth rates and we expect this trend to continue for the reminder of the year. This overall improved organic growth performance contributes an incremental $0.25 of EPS impact for the full year of 2015, which is over and above the $0.45 to $0.55 EPS benefit we described in our initial guidance back in January.  The second item is our ability to accelerate our share count action in the first quarter of 2015 given our confidence in cash flow outlook that I described earlier. Specifically, we executed cash repurchases and equity derivatives that reduced our share count by approximately 8 million shares. Our prior assumption was that much of these actions were to occur during the second half of 2015. We did increase our debt levels modestly to execute this plan, and combined with normal first quarter seasonality of cash outflow, this increase in debt will be a temporary phenomenon. The results of these share count actions are a benefit of approximately $0.10 of EPS over and above the initial range we provided in January of $0.09 to $0.12 of EPS.  Then finally, as I just covered in a fair amount of detail, we expect to $200 million to $220 million of currency pressure given the strengthening of the US dollar over the past 90 days, versus our prior expectation of $140 million to $150 million. This will generate an incremental $0.30 to $0.35 of EPS headwind for 2015. Also keep in mind that our other planning assumptions, including tax rates and restructuring costs remain the same for the full year.  There’s three other items that are important to take note of related to guidance as you start to think about the different quarters and how they stage for the full year. The first item though is related to revenue and the adverse currency impact is now expected to be approximately 7% versus our prior assumption of approximately 4% to 5% for the full year. This will result in total revenues being down approximately 2% on the full year. Second item is restructuring charges in the first half of 2015 will approximate 80% of our full year expected restructuring charges of $50 million.  Then finally I remind everyone to recognize the seasonality of revenues and profitability that happens in our company every year in the first half. We expect that our operating margin as a percentage of the full year to be relatively consistent with 2014 when you evaluate first half versus second half. However, higher planned restructuring charges and the higher tax rate in the first half of 2015 will result in first half EPS approximating 43% of the full year EPS, which is modestly lower than the 2014 first half as a percentage of the full year and clearly due to the dynamics of restructuring and tax.  Now let’s turn to segments, which are presented on the right side of the page and in our reporting structure. We expect mid to single high digit organic growth in the Tools and Storage business, as well as solid operating margin rate expansion year over year. The operating margin expansion is expected to be due to volume leverage, cost actions and price which more than offset the negative currency impact. Organic growth within this segment is expected to remain strong in the first half and show lower levels of growth in the back half as we begin to experience more difficult comparables. Our security segment will have a modest organic revenue growth for the full year, with the margin rate increasing versus the prior year. The organic growth in security in North America and emerging markets will compliment an improving performance in security Europe, which started the year with good momentum as you heard from Jim earlier.  Profitability in security will continue to improve versus prior year, from volume leverage and cost actions, which again will allow us to more than offset the foreign currency impact. We expect solid year over year profit improvement as we continue progressing forward with our security Europe multiyear recovery plan. Then finally for industrial, we expect solid mid-single digit organic growth as Engineered Fastening strengths will be able to offset the expected declines in our oil and gas business. However, due to the now increased importance of oil and gas as a percentage of this particular segment, we do expect margins to be relatively flat versus the prior year as volume leverage generated by Engineered Fastening will be offset by the deleveraging impact of oil and gas due to the sluggish market conditions in that particular business. This assumption change more about the impact of recasting our reporting segments than it is a change in business assumptions since January.  In summary, the strength of our Tools and Storage organic growth, combined with accelerated share count actions, offsets the higher foreign currency impact I just described. Therefore we still expect to achieve solid operating leverage and healthy organic growth even with the incremental currency headwinds, which means we expect earnings will expand 5% to 9% on an overall revenue decline of 2% in 2015. Additionally, we believe we will continue to demonstrate strong free cash flow as it would be at least $1 billion.  To summarize the presentation portion of our call today, we believe we delivered a very strong start to the year and here are some of the highlights. We are very pleased with the strong robust organic growth story in the first quarter of 8%. Focused on the tight cost control and surgical price actions across our entire company, which enabled an excellent Q1 operating leverage in the face of $50 million of currency headwinds. Security took another positive step forward on its multi-year transformation, with 2% organic growth and year over year profit growth. Then finally, because of our confidence in our free cash flow outlook, we were able to accelerate our share repurchase program, which means we’ve really completed $900 million of our program since the fourth quarter of last year in the program that we announced back in the end of 2013.  Our operational focus in 2015 will continue to be on improving near term returns and the relative performance of our company through organic growth initiatives, the security margin improvement and stability and continued growth organically, cost and pricing actions and of course our ongoing working capitals focus. We believe this approach was very successful in2014 and again here in the first quarter and we will continue this focus for the remainder of 2015 and beyond as it does position our company to deliver on the long-term financial objectives that we have established.  That concludes the presentation portion of our call. Now let’s move to Q&A.
Gregory Waybright: Great. Thanks Don. John, we can now open the call to Q&A, please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you very much, gentlemen. You made a very busy day a little easier here today. I have one question really on your cost actions and kind of thinking about the holistic nature of them. And really the nature of my question is, these offsetting actions you are taking, would you view them all as structural and permanent? Or should we expect some of this to come back the other way as perhaps the FX pressures hopefully wane at some point in the future? If you could give us a little context around that, I think it would be very helpful. Thank you.
John Lundgren: Yeah, absolutely. So we embarked on this journey of cost actions in a more significant way about a year and half to two years ago and one of our main objectives was to take actions that were permanent in nature and not temporary that would result in some type of snapback of costs in the future. We’ve been targeting areas such as indirect spend, which is basically all costs that are non-people related and putting forth policy changes, structural changes, procurement changes, etc., that are driving a lot of those benefits. And they’re permanent changes that we expect to be maintained over the long term.  The other thing that we’ve done is we’ve taken specific headcount restructuring actions related to the combination of our CDIY and IAR business for Tools and Storage. We’ve taken some corporate headcount actions, as well as some of our other businesses that are more surgical in nature that will allow us to really continue to focus on productivity and driving a more efficient P&L Because of this approach and these different types of actions, it really gives us confidence that it’s not of the nature that we are just pushing down costs on a temporary basis and we will experience some snapback in the future.
Operator: And our next question is from Rick Kwas from Wells Fargo.
Rich Kwas: Good morning, gentlemen. In terms of the competitive environment with regards to currency, any changes you've noticed here in the US with competitive actions from foreign-based entities? And then quick follow up, hedging activity for 2016, Don, does this leave you in a position where you're going to still get hit in 2016 unless you put incremental hedges in? How should we think about that as we look forward here? Thank you. 
Donald Allan: Yeah I’ll take the latter one first. As I mentioned, we’ve done a lot of hedging activities specifically around the Euro and the Canadian dollar. The benefit we are getting for that here in 2015 or the neutralization I guess of currency is about $70 million. And so that would be an impact that we would see in 2016. We’ll also have a modest carry over impact by some of the recent currency movements we’ve seen. So we think going into next year, there is about $100 million headwind for currency that some of which we are focused on how we deal with through hedging activities, but we are also focused on what cost actions we can take as we go into 2016 to offset that impact as well. Similar to what we’ve done over the last two years, we are going to take a very similar approach to that as we embark into 2016 as well. And Jim maybe you want to answer the comment on …
James Loree: On the competitive environment in the US and whether there have been any changes related to the FX dislocation that’s occurred. Most of our, in fact all of our major competitors have global footprints that are relatively similar. Our major European based competitor has a little bit more European footprint in terms of supply chains and our major Japanese competitor has a little bit more in Japan. But we all have a lot in China, Mexico and other low cost areas around the world. So there really isn’t a major structural change to the cost competitors that is created by the dislocation. I think we are all responding -- all competitors are responding as you might expect, which is in the emerging markets where we are shipping into those markets from dollar stable kinds of -- or dollar, like Chinese or dollar denominated supply chains, there is a fair amount of price appreciation going on to partially offset the currency impact and then the US is always brutally competitive and continues to be brutally competitive.
Operator: Our next question is from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.
David MacGregor: Yes. Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter and all the progress. I guess the CDIY, your incremental margins were substantially larger than I'd expected and obviously there's an awful lot going on in that segment right now. But I guess the question is just how much of this is from the combination of the IAR business and are these contribution margins expected to sustain through the rest of the year?
John Lundgren: David, very fair question. There are cost benefits to the combination of the IAR business. They’re quite small relative to the volume leverage particularly the advantage of a prolific new product development process that really was founded or grounded in our CDIY business. It’s now incorporating IAR. So roughly three quarters, two thirds of the benefit and ability to maintain margins is due to the volume leverage new products and incremental margins and only a small portion would be due to the -- there are some cost benefits, but that is truly the icing on the cake rather than the driver for putting these two businesses together. 
James Loree: But as far as the impact in the quarter or in the past couple of quarters, it’s been nil. This is just getting going, so the impact that John just described is yet to come.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Robert Barry: Good morning. Congrats on a very solid quarter. Wanted to just talk a little more about the organic growth outlook. You raised it by 1 to 2 points and wanted to clarify how much of that is stronger end markets versus better momentum on your own initiatives and to the extent that it's the markets, where are you seeing any incremental strength or weakness?
John Lundgren: Yeah, I’ll take a shot at that and I’ll certainly ask Jim or Don to chime in. It is overwhelmingly share gains in our case. 50% of our revenue roughly is in the US. Those markets are slightly stronger than we’d anticipate. But you saw our Global Tools and Storage business up 12% in the quarter. So there’s significant share gain there. Europe as I said in my piece of the presentation, globally the markets are up 2% at best. Some estimates are flat and we are up six 6%. So again, it’s easily 3X the market growth rate. Now Tools and Storage business is up more than that. So again share gains. I think the wild card is in the emerging markets, which collectively represent about 20% of our revenue. They’re up but at a much lower rate as Jim mentioned in his piece of the presentation. Certain markets like China and Russia are down, but in total the emerging markets are growing at low single digits and so are we. So simply said, the overwhelming majority of what you’ve seen in our numbers is share gain and again it’s focused in our Global Tools and Storage business and our Engineered Fastening business. 
Operator: Our next question is from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley
Mike Sang: Hey, good morning guys. It's actually Mike Sang in for Nigel. I didn't see capital deployment guidance and I apologize if you talked about it, but you didn't change your free cash guidance, but to the extent you do better on free cash this year, how should we think about where you'll spend that incremental upside?
Donald Allan: This is Don. We didn’t specifically give guidance related to capital deployment. What we have said about this year though is our primary objective was to complete our program of up to $1 billion of share repurchase and you could argue that we’ve pretty much done that with $900 million of it completed at this point in time. We also said that we have opened up our -- reopened our funnel of BD opportunities over the last six months or so and we are evaluating different things and we may have some types of small acquisition later in the year of modest size. But that’s really about what the plan is at this stage and we feel good about where we are. If we outperform our cash flow, we’ll have to evaluate the timing of that and would make sense based on what’s happening in BD as well as what our stock is trading at that point in time.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse
Mike Dahl: Hi, thanks and quite a nice quarter again. Some pretty challenges conditions with the FX side. I wanted to go back to one of the prior comments on walking around the regions. John, I think you've been clear that some of these European comps, a lot of it's been driven by some tremendous share growth and new product innovation. What's the expectation as far as -- I know you mentioned that you think it'll moderate, but has the continued strength caused you to push out your expectation for how long you can keep a four or five point premium to the market growth on that side of the business?
John Lundgren: Sure. I'm going to have Jim walk you through that, but remember we‘ve got a stated objective of growing at 2x the rate of the market and we’ve been doing a pretty good job in our Global Tools and Storage business. But Jim, I know you want to shade more light on that.
James Loree: It's a great question because the comps are -- we are comping against two years organics growth in the tool business that’s averaging about 7% per quarter. When you look at the market growth and you look at that you say how long can this go on? It's very fair question, but I would say that the team in European tools in particular, but also in Engineered Fastening, those two management teams are really, really growth oriented teams. And the ability to gain share is not constrained necessary by structural conditions. If they keep executing at that level, then I think that it will be in that 4% to 6% range for a while. And the other thing about Europe is that even though the markets haven’t picked up, the optimism in Europe is palpably higher. If you talk to business people in Europe, there’s a lot of hope I guess is the best phrase or word I can think of, but not necessarily with our people. But when you just talk to people in general in Europe, there’s a sentiment, a more positive sentiment than we’ve seen in a long, long time. That may actually help with the market and may over time push the market up a few points and certainly that would be helpful as well. But the reality of tough difficult comps is a real one and it's one where we don’t necessarily push our expectations to organic growth much higher than say 4% to 6 %. I think achieving that 2x market growth is something that we can continue to do for a while.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital
Jeff Kessler: Not to steal the thunder from Investor Day, but could you go over -- be a little bit more specific as to the four parts of SFS 2 and how they impacted the first quarter, how you expect them to impact the year? What are -- specifically what are they going to do? And number two, put some numbers to that to flesh it out.
James Loree: Sure. That’s kind of like Investor Day, but I'll give you a quick snapshot.
Jeff Kessler: Yeah. That's all I want.
James Loree:  The four initiatives, Digital Excellence, Breakthrough Innovations, Commercial Excellence, and Functional Transformation, we’ll start with functional transformation is an approach that we are taking to reduce the cost of our staff functions if you will, so increase their efficiency while maintaining their effectiveness, which is very high. The functional transformation will yield benefits over a multi-year period, but really at the moment we are investing in this. There’s an actual expense related to it in the quarter and we’ll get into that at the investor day. The other three are intended to drive growth and they all require some investment, but the functional transformation is a way to fund that investment without affecting our day to day operations in a negative way.  Digital Excellence, we are doing a fair amount of work in that area to prioritize where we’re going to make our investments. So there’s not really any revenue impact from that at this point in time. There are some expenses associated with that. I think the one that has the most near term impact is Commercial Excellence because commercial excellence includes several different elements. One of those element is pricing effectiveness and you probably have noticed over the last year or so that we have been averaging about a point in price as a company and that is about a point higher than we have been doing historically. I would say virtually a large portion of that differential impact is associated with the Commercial Excellence initiative. There are many other parts to it. I think I used the term Commercial Excellence several times when I was discussing the CDIY or the Global Tool Business and they have really taken Commercial Excellence and each element of it and deployed it within that business to achieve some of their differentiated performance and share gains. They can do even more with Commercial Excellence and the rest of the company can really do a lot more with that. So that’s what we expect to see in the future. And the final one, it's important to differentiate between what I’ll call incremental innovation or day to day innovation, which I think we and our competitors all do reasonably well. We have things like, a good example do that would be the DC brushless innovation that we’ve done recently and the share gain that we’ve achieved through that.  The Breakthrough Innovation is basically taking, going beyond Incremental Innovation and really looking for those breakthroughs that can change the whole competitive framework of the industry and give us a competitive advantage. So we have studied competes in the best pockets of breakthrough innovation in the world, primarily in the US. And we have deployed some of the practices that you’ll see in the valley and so forth. And we are doing some experimentation with that and we are hopeful that we can create some breakthrough innovations. In the meantime we are going full speed ahead with our normal incremental innovation and the incremental innovation is really what’s driving the share gain and one of the things that’s driving the share gain on the tools business today. That’s a quick snapshot. There’s plenty more to come on May 15.
John Lundgren: Jeff. Just let me tie that up in a bow without -- and Jim there I think did a very nice job of not stealing our own thunder for Investor Day because we’ve got a lot of communicate. We want communicate it very coherently and systematically all in the same place. But SFS or SFS 1.0 if you like was focused on operational excellence. We think we’ve done a very, very good job and working capital turns have doubled as a result of that. Eliminate ways to eliminate complexity, unless it adds a benefit that the customer is willing to pay for and so forth. You’ve heard us talk about it a lot. We think we’ve gotten it down. We’ve been at it about eight years and we think it truly, truly is imbedded in the DNA of this company. What Jim described is an effort -- in terms of when will the benefits come, we are paying as we go and I think Jim described that perfectly in terms of we’re investing in getting a little bit of benefit.  The future benefits will come well down the road just like they have with SFS. But importantly, it is all designed to embed a growth culture, first establish an embedded growth culture within the company. If we look at all our long-term objectives, we’ve done a really good job meeting or exceeding all of them with the exception of organic growth, where over the years we’ve been at 3% to 4%, which is then about the industry average, about our competitors average, peer group average. Of late, we’ve stepped that up due to some phenomenal results from the incremental growth platforms and programs that Jim described. Long-term we are looking to drive that up and just embed it into our culture and have it become equally as important in our DNA as we think running our operations effectively and efficiently has become.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeremie Capron from CLSA.
Jeremie Capron: Thanks and good morning. I wanted to follow up on your commentary on pricing. You had a full point of price gains in the quarter, and you sounded pretty dismissive in terms of any deterioration in the pricing environment globally, yet we're seeing a peeled down train in commodity prices. My question really is how sustainable do you think your price gains are for the remainder of the year and what sort of dynamics are you seeing in terms of your price cost. It looks like a nice tailwind here.
Donald Allan: Sure. I’ll take that one. Yeah, we were very pleased as John mentioned with our price performance in Q1. We’ve talked about price as a company on and off over the last decade several times, but in the last year, year and half, we’ve really put a significant emphasis on gaining price in different ways across many of our businesses. It’s not always just about list price. It’s about other types of activities that happen with your customers and really trying to drive the maximum value associated with the product or the service that you’re providing to your customer. That emphasis has not changed. There has been a new dynamic as you mentioned in the last six months or so where commodities have moved in a certain direction it’s been a benefit to companies like us.  The reality for us is the number is not overly significant. We touched on it briefly back in January. It’s roughly $50 million of benefits for us on an annualized basis. At this point in time, we continue to evaluate that as we go into next year and see what other opportunities we have. But it’s not really large enough to drive a significant pricing discussion across an $11 billion enterprise like our company. If that dynamic ever changes, then we could potentially have the circumstances that you described and we have gone through those cycles. But we have put significant routines and processes in place around pricing to really deal with these types of dynamics and make sure that we understand the levels of profitability that we are achieving on key products, especially what we call our A products and services that we provide and I don’t expect that focus to change. I actually expect it to accelerate and become more mature overtime.
Operator: And our next question is from Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Please go ahead.
Liam Burke: Thank you. Your growth domestically on Tools and Storage was pretty strong. You have brought back manufacturing to the US. Has that program helped drive organic sales growth and do you plan on adding more capacity in the US?
John Lundgren: Yeah, Liam I’ll take it. The answer is absolutely yes. Yes and yes. Simply said, we knew -- it’s turned to be not a terrific hedge in terms of production costs, because when we first brought this production back we had total delivered product cost. Obviously we took a lot of product off the water in time and improved our working capital turns. We had costs within flat to 5% and we are driving that down towards cost neutral relative to some of the low cost countries. It’s probably not at parity now given the strength of the dollar. That means, but we knew it was a good thing to do in terms of supply chain, satisfying our customers, keeping fill rates above 98%. We underestimated the positive impact customer reaction, particularly in the industrial distribution channel and what we call the two step channel of the, quite frankly the loyalty. It created the incredibly positive reaction from professional contractors and folks working in manufacturing facilities around the country.  So we are very pleased with not only our ability to get the facilities up and running, we’re very pleased with -- we’re delighted by the customer reaction. As a consequence, we’re looking at two other opportunities near term in the US and again, it’s not going to be a step function ship, but it will be a gradual shift to expand two existing US facilities to produce more of our core products sold primarily in the US in those markets. More to come on that when it happens. We can’t get ahead of ourselves in terms of our own workforce then our planning and various negotiations are currently in process. But there is more to come. As I say it will not be gigantic, but it will be incremental or an evolution versus the revolution, but based on the results to date, we’ve got a lot of good reasons, qualitatively and quantitatively to do some more of this in the next 6 to 18 months.
Operator: Our next question is from next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Go ahead Michael with your question.
John Lundgren: Mike, are you on mute? 
Gregory Waybright: Move to the next one.
Operator: We have a question from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill: Good morning. Thank you. I just want to go back to an earlier question on the margin performance in the first quarter and the new tools and storage business. If you look year over year, that incremental margin being over 70%, and I think you talked to for the full year some of the drivers that are plus or minus. But was just hoping maybe you can talk to specific in the quarter, what the drivers were there and then how you think some of those drivers progress as you move through the year.
John Lundgren: Sure, we can touch on that. As we touched on obviously, we saw significant operating leverage through the organic growth. We also are seeing really solid benefits from SG&A actions that I mentioned around indirect costs. We’ve seen some good pricing initiatives that drop all the way to the bottom line. It’s a combination of all those factors. Of course there’s also a little bit of commodity deflation occurring as well that’s beneficial to this particular business. Combining that with the fact that I mentioned at the beginning, which is organic growth, you have a high level of activity happening in our plants that occur because of higher organic growth in Q1 and expected higher organic growth in Q2 well above what we experienced in the first half or the first quarter of last year. So there’s certainly a leverage effect that’s even greater than you would normally see because of organic growth numbers that are basically double digit.
Operator: And I will now turn it back over to Greg Waybright for closing remarks.
Gregory Waybright: John, thank you. We’d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation in the call. And obviously, please contact me if you’ve any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Q4 and Fiscal Year 2014 Stanley Black & Decker Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is John. I’ll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I’ll now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. You may begin.
Gregory Waybright: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's fourth quarter 2014 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our Web site as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review our fourth quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we’re going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I’ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. We’ve got a great deal to talk about this morning. So I’m going to run very quickly through the highlights. So Jim Loree and Don Allan can get into more detail and then we can jump right into the Q&A. Looking at fourth quarter highlights, revenue expanded 7% organically led by CDIY was up 11% and strong performance in industrial up 5%. But it's also noticeable that Security expanded in the quarter with mid single-digit organic growth in North American emerging markets and flat performance in Europe. Operating margin for the quarter was 13.7% which was up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Volume, sharp cost focus and pricing benefits were partially offset by the currency headwinds. The currency issues that you’ve heard a lot about intensified in the fourth quarter, as we absorbed a headwind of approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter, which was $10 million worse than we expected. And that brought the total for the year to approximately $85 million of foreign exchange headwinds, a combination of translational and transactional. The Security turnaround continues and we were encouraged that the European operating margin rate improved sequentially and versus prior year by approximately 110 basis points. Our fourth quarter capped an encouraging year. So I'll just take a minute and look at the results for the total year, revenues up 5% organically with CDIY delivering 7%, Industrial 5%, and Security flat. Earnings per share grew 14% on an adjusted basis and now have converged with our GAAP earnings per share. Free cash flow was a record almost $1 billion as the team delivered over one full working capital turn improvement up to the level of 9.2 working capital turns for the total Company. And our cash flow return on investment improved 390 basis points to 13% as our record cash flow coupled with our decapitalization plan improved this metric. It’s probably important to note, Don can cover it more detail if need be, 340 of the 390 basis points of that improvement was operational where about 50 basis points of the improvement was due to the FX devaluation impact on equity. So arguably one small benefit of the foreign exchange headwind that we’ve been facing. And finally, we’re initiating GAAP EPS guidance of $5.65 to $5.85 per share, 5% to 9% growth, absorbing foreign exchange headwinds currently estimated at $140 million for 2015 versus the $85 million I discussed in 2014. But it also includes free cash flow estimate of at least $1 billion and Don is going to cover that in more detail when we get to the outlook. So moving on, let's take a look at where the growth came from in the fourth quarter and for the year. We achieved strong volume growth across developed and emerging markets. Europe remains strong, particularly strong across CDIY and Industrial performed well. Pricing actions within emerging markets and surgical pricing actions across the remainder of our businesses are contributing to organic growth. But with this being said, currency headwinds intensified as we move through the quarter and as a consequence dampened our organic growth performance by about four percentage points as the dollar strengthened against most currencies. And again, Don has got some more granularity on that, so I’ll not delve on it at this point in our presentation. From a regional perspective, demand in the U.S was healthy in both retail and industrial. Importantly, in retail we had strong sell-in as well as strong sell-through in our retail channels. Jim will discuss that and where we stand in terms of inventories as we kick off 2015. Europe showed some exceptional share gains. Most noticeably in CDIY, but also in industrial both within IAR and the automotive end markets, as those markets are likely tracking flat to slightly up at best. And Jim is going to talk more about the drivers of that performance. Emerging markets were heavily influenced by strong shipments in our Engineered Fastening Electronics business in Asia, but also experienced good solid growth in our tools business in Latin America. So when we put it all together for the full-year, our volume -- organic volume growth and performance outpaced GDP in each and every region where we do business. And that's a testament to the organic growth initiatives that we’ve discussed on previous calls. Let me turn it over to Jim Loree to get into some more detail on the segments and some of the programs that are driving those results.
James M. Loree: Okay. Thank you, John. Along those lines we’ve made a very determined effort over the past two years to ramp up organic growth and importantly translated into operating leverage. So it's fulfilling to close out 2014 with a record 7% organic growth quarter, our highest full year OM rates since the Stanley Black & Decker merger and record full-year EPS and cash flow. We also, as John mentioned, achieved 9.2 working capital turns, a first for us, which contributed to a 130% cash conversion ratio for the year. And it's especially encouraging that all this was accomplished in the face of $85 million or about little more than $0.40 a share of unplanned currency headwinds amidst a slowing global growth environment outside the U.S. It's clear that our operating management team is executing at a high level and it’s charged up and more than prepared to continue to drive results in a challenging environment. For the business level commentary, I’ll start with CDIY, which served up another outstanding quarter. Organic growth was 11% against the 6% comp in 4Q ’13. All major geographies contributed, with North America up 14%, Europe once again overcoming challenging end markets, up 7% organically, and emerging markets up 7%. Total revenue was also up 7% and operating margin grew 18% demonstrating impressive operating leverage. Gains resulted from cost leveraged, modestly positive price, operations productivity, and tight SG&A cost management, which more than offset severe currency headwinds. Across the global CDIY product lines, organic strength was once again broad-based with professional power tools up an exceptional 20% and Tools and Storage up 10%, Fastening & Accessories 7% and Consumer products up 2%. CDIY new product development momentum in concert with a business wide commitment to commercial excellence and continued exploitation of the revenue synergies from the merger are driving both revenue and profit growth. The DeWalt DC brushless line powered by electronically commutated motors is off to a very strong start. This fast growing category in which we enjoy a substantial lead already represents 20% of the cordless market. And putting the Company’s leading array of brands to work across categories also continues to further enhance our strong customer partnerships as well as produce favorable POS results. Examples abound, such as DeWalt storage, adhesives and hand tools, Stanley FatMax power tools and Bostitch hand and power tools, which are all producing meaningful gains. CDIY’s robust supply chain capabilities developed through many years of continuous improvement via the Stanley fulfillment system have continued to support its commercial successes and also enabled CDIY to achieve 10 working capital turns for the first time. While global growth has been decelerating in most areas outside the U.S., underlying U.S tool demand remains solid as DIY fundamentals are strong and new construction markets are moving in the right direction albeit with some choppiness. So North America once again enjoyed the benefits of combining excellent commercial execution in a market with solid fundamentals, the result being 14% organic growth at a positive share trend. Now shifting over to Europe, where the markets remain weak, but the performance continues to be impressive. Here our team acknowledges the reality -- market realities and understands that strong growth is only possible with their commercial engine hitting on all cylinders. We call it commercial excellence. That is what they’ve accomplished over the past seven quarters, accumulating a 7% organic growth track record during that time. And their success has derived from robust new product commercialization, brand leverage, growing customer partnerships and excellent sales in channel execution. The other CDIY growth story for the quarter was emerging markets, up 7% organically. Notable in the face of high volatility and continued downward revision to GDP estimates, most recently in Argentina, Brazil, and Russia. Nonetheless, Latin America was up 9% organically and the Middle East Africa region was also very strong, a combination more than offsetting weakness in Russia, Turkey, and China. Our major NPD initiative into mid price point tools across all these developing markets is coming at a time when end-user said to be more cost conscious with their purchases. The program is less tracking to plan and is expected to contribute greater than $50 million of incremental revenue in 2015 as it continues to gain momentum. And as we look ahead for CDIY, we anticipate continued strong performance. The winning formula of organizational agility, global scale, robust NPD, great brands and tight control of costs should more than compensate for lackluster markets in Europe and some of the emerging regions as well as a strengthening dollar environment. In this regard, with our CDIY and IAR businesses, both operating from positions of strength, after an expensive evaluation we recently took the action to combine these two businesses into one global tools and storage unit with revenues totaling about $7 billion. While there are meaningful cost savings associated with this consolidation, the overwhelming rationale for this move is to harness the extraordinary go to market potential of our total tools franchise.  This unified approach will enable us to capture the benefits and competitive advantages of being the world's largest branded tool company. We are the only player with major positions in each of power tools, hand tools, accessories and storage, as well as significant global channel presence in all four major end markets, construction, DIY, industrial, and auto repair. In addition, we intend to leverage the unique organizational strengths of both CDIY and IAR, including technology, product development, and global footprint across a larger base. This exciting next step in our evolution should be viewed as a growth enhancer and a logical extension of the Stanley Black & Decker integration that has produced stellar results over the last five years or so. Now turning to Industrial. Industrial this quarter once again logged a solid organic growth quarter, up 5% and maintained its margin in the mid 15% zone. However, FX pressures weighed down total revenue and operating margin growth, which were up 1% and flat respectively. For IAR, organic growth of 5% benefited from good performances in both developed and developing countries. North America was up 8%, Europe was up 3% organically in the quarter, capping off a plus 7% performance for the year and IAR emerging markets came in up 5% with dynamics very similar to those experienced in CDIY. Engineered Fastening grew an impressive 10% organically in 4Q with automotive up 11%, demonstrating market penetration gains in view of light vehicle production levels, which were up 1%. The industrial portion of Engineered Fastening was also a good organic story with growth up at similar levels as we supported a major customer’s very strong new product launches. We continue to love this Engineered Fastening business, which grew to $1.5 billion in revenues, produced full-year operating margin growth of 20%, and achieved a record 18% operating margin rate. Infrastructure was down 10% organically as lower oil prices and deferral of pipeline projects begin to take their toll on our oil and gas business, which represents 3% of total company revenues. All in all, it was a solid quarter for Industrial in view of the currency issues and downward pressure on GDP outside of the U.S. Moving to Security. It was a very important and modestly successful quarter for Security, which in addition to its third consecutive quarter of stable OM rates in the 12% zone, achieved positive organic growth with a plus 3% performance. Total Security revenues declined 1% as FX weighed down total growth and North America emerging markets was up 5% organically with strength from both the vertical market initiative and from Access Technologies. Security Europe was flat organically for the first time since 2011, the year Niscayah was acquired, that the organic rate was not negative. While that is admittedly comparing against the low bar, the trend is in line with our turnaround plan and that’s encouraging. Europe OM percent was up in the mid to high single-digit range, up 110 basis points versus a year-ago and representing the third consecutive sequential quarterly improvement. Order rates in both North America and Europe continued on their positive trend and attrition in Europe remained on target at 12%. The organization has responded well to the leadership adjustments made in the fourth quarter and both North America and Europe are poised to deliver organic revenue growth and be accretive to operating margin in 2015. While we expect the overall Security recovery to be slow and steady during the next several quarters, we do expect it to continue to gain momentum as 2015 progresses. The decision to divest Spain and Italy, previously announced, will remove structural obstacles from the European recovery. In summary, Security has achieved stability during the last several quarters and appears to have bottomed. In this regard, it should know longer be viewed as a major downside risk, but rather as a modest earnings growth opportunity in the near-term. The next step in the evolution is to demonstrate a sustained ability to generate organic growth, while further improving cost efficiency. This will play out over the coming quarters. And depending on the success of that trajectory, it is possible to envision OM rate expansion moving toward Company line average over time. So while Security still have has a way to go, especially in Europe, the turnaround is on track and we expect it to become an earnings growth contributor in the very near future. With that, I’ll turn it over to Don Allan for commentary on the financials, including our 2015 outlook.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. We are very pleased with our 2014 cash flow performance, which resulted in $991 million of free cash flow, just shy of a $1 billion. The free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was a healthy 130% as you just heard from Jim. As we experienced during the majority of 2014, our free cash flow benefited from increased operational earnings, lower restructuring payments, and reduced capital expenditures. The Q4 free cash flow was stronger than expected due to these factors combined with an outstanding working capital turn performance. Due to certain seasonality aspects of our CDIY business, we experienced a significant positive working capital benefit in the fourth quarter of every year. As a result, we tend to generate approximately 60% of our annual free cash flow in the fourth quarter. However, our businesses performed above and beyond this seasonality trend, and drove working capital turns to 9.2 times which is up more than a full turn versus 2013. We indicated in October that our objective was to push towards the year-end. Our businesses did an excellent job exceeding this expectation through the continued use of the Stanley fulfillment system. It is exciting to see our long-term objective of 10 working capital turns very close on the horizon, hopefully within the next two years. This strong cash flow performance allowed us to achieve our debt deleveraging goals for 2014 and we were able to commence the previously communicated share repurchase program in the fourth quarter through the use of some equity forward share repurchase derivatives. Now let's review our 2015 EPS and cash flow outlook on Page 10. As indicated by John earlier, we’re establishing 2015 guidance at $5.65 to $5.85 of EPS, and free cash flow of at least $1 billion. As indicated throughout 2014 by myself, John, and Jim, we’re changing to GAAP guidance in 2015 due to the lower levels of M&A and expected one-time charges. However, we recognize all your current 2015 estimates are before these one-time charges. Therefore to provide transparency in this conversion we had disclosed on this page that our EPS guidance range includes approximately $0.25 in restructuring charges. On a comparable basis to our adjusted 2014 results just reported today, our EPS guidance range excluding restructuring charges is $5.90 to $6.10 EPS. Greg and Dennis will work with all of you over the next several days to ensure this conversion in guidance is clearly understood. There are several factors within our annual guidance which we consider significant and I would like to explain in some detail. Starting with some key tailwinds. The first item is we expect organic growth to be up 3% to 4%, which will be translating into EPS of $0.45 to $0.55, which is a similar leverage ratio we’ve seen over the past few years. The organic growth is slightly lower than the 5% organic growth we just experienced in 2014 as markets outside the U.S are likely to be challenged in 2015. Specifically, we expect emerging markets to be volatile and organic growth in many emerging countries will be muted by the strength of the U.S dollar or political unrest. Additionally, we expect several European markets we serve to be challenged and the outside share gains we’ve achieved in CDIY over the past few years although have been fantastic, we believe it will become more difficult to repeat those on an ongoing basis. Also we do anticipate a slowdown in our oil and gas business from lower crude oil prices. The next item related to tailwind is the execution of various cost and customer pricing actions during 2015, which will be a tailwind of approximately $0.50. The SG&A cost actions represent a further cost rationalization of certain areas in our Company. Specifically, in the Security business we’re reducing back-office costs and overhead costs to improve profitability while at the same time we want to enhance our SG&A investments to stimulate growth within the verticals. We also have taken surgical cost actions in a few functions in other businesses and at corporate headquarters. Additionally, as Jim mentioned, we’ve decided to combine our CDIY and IAR businesses to better serve our various tools and storage customers and further accelerate growth. This combination is generating from solid back-office cost savings as you'd expect. All of these cost actions commenced over the past two months and will continue to be implemented in the first half of 2015 to ensure we achieve our profitability objectives. The 2015 impact of these cost actions represents approximately 50% of the $0.50 EPS tailwind. The remaining 50% of this tailwind relates more directly to actions we can take in response to FX pressures, specifically key strategic pricing increases for products that we import into the Canadian, Brazilian, and European markets, as well as pursuing commodity deflation opportunities with many of our suppliers. The commodity deflation we’re currently focused on is in the areas of diesel fuel, resin, and copper. However, we continue to monitor this area for other future opportunities as the year evolves. The final tailwind shown on page 10 is the continuation of the share repurchase program in 2015. And we expect an EPS benefit to be approximately $0.09 to $0.12 during the year as the repurchase program will be staggered throughout 2015 and in line with our cash flow generation as it occurs during the year. And many of you know, a large part of our cash occurs in the back half of each year. Now shifting to headwinds. John mentioned the FX headwind we’ve experienced in the fourth quarter, while we like many other U.S multinationals have a significant headwind for 2015 related to foreign currencies as they weakened versus the U.S dollar. As a result, we now expect approximately $140 million of currency pressure, given the strengthening of the U.S dollar over the past 90 days. This will generate $0.70 to $0.75 EPS headwind for 2015. I'll provide more detail insights relating to FX impacting our Company on the next slide, and more importantly, how we hedge these risks and respond to operations. A few other items of note related to annual EPS on the left side of the page you can see. First is the tax rate will be relatively consistent for 2014, which means approximately 21%. Also I want to remind everyone to recognize the seasonality of revenue and profitability in the first quarter, as it is historically the lowest revenue and profit quarter for us. We expect the normal operating profit seasonality again this year in 2015. However, additionally we'll expect higher levels of restructuring charges and higher levels of impacts of foreign currency in the first quarter of ’15 versus the first quarter of 2014. And specifically related to restructuring, in Q1 2015, the charges will approximate 60% of the full-year $50 million restructuring estimate. Therefore, Q1 2015 EPS will approximate 16% of the full-year EPS. Let's turn to the right side of the page and discuss a little bit of details around our segments for 2015. We expect mid single-digit organic revenue growth and solid operating margin rate expansion year-over-year in both the CDIY and industrial segments due to volume leverage, price actions and cost controls which will more than offset the significant currency impact. Our Security segment will have a modest organic growth number for the full-year. The organic growth in Security North America and emerging markets will complement an improving performance in Security Europe, where we anticipate growth to begin to emerge in the second half of the year. Profitability in Security will continue to improve from volume leverage and cost actions, which will more than offset the foreign currency impact. We expect solid year-over-year profit improvement as we continue to progress forward with our Security Europe multi-year recovery plan. Although the currency challenges have been unrelenting and they’re causing a significant 2015 headwind, we believe we’re taking all the correct actions to combat these headwinds through our cost control actions and customer pricing initiatives, while at the same time ensuring we continue to strategically invest in organic growth. This approach will allow us to achieve solid operating leverage and healthy organic growth, but muted total revenue growth due to FX. Specifically, earnings will expand 5% to 9% on an overall revenue outlook of flat to a decline of 1% in 2015. So moving to the next slide and a little bit of discussion on foreign currency. As you’re all aware, U.S dollar strengthened during late September and October against the four major currencies which impact us, Canadian dollar, European euro, Brazilian real and the Argentinean peso. At the time, this created a negative currency impact of approximately $45 million to $55 million for 2015. However, we’ve all seen the additional devaluations in most currencies versus the U.S dollar since mid November through the last several days. This included other currencies which impact us, such as the British pound, Australian dollar, Swedish krona, and Japanese yen. We have finalized our key currency hedging activities for 2015 over the past several months based on yesterday's spot rates. We estimate that 2015 negative currency impact will approximate $140 million versus 2014 and this includes the impact of these currency hedges. The expected 2015 impact is approximately 50% translational and 50% transactional. The transactional impact is due to our extensive global supply chains and primarily related to the importing of finished goods and components into regions such as Latin America, Europe, and Canada. In terms of hedging, our key currencies are materially hedged and as such future volatility on our largest exposures; specifically the Canadian dollar and the European euro have been significantly reduced for the remainder of 2015. As an example, if the euro moved to parity with the U.S dollar gradually over the next five months, we’d only expect an additional $12 million to $15 million P&L impact in 2015. Now I'd like to discuss a few things outside of hedging activities related to currencies and how we respond operationally. We are typically prepared to take additional mitigating actions to offset significant portion -- a significant portion of these currency impacts in the following order. First, as I just mentioned, we pursue customer price increases where large transactional FX headwinds emerged due to us importing U.S dollar based products or components into these countries or regions. The second area is we focus on improving our cost base to the pursuit of commodity deflation in this type of environment. The third area is we look at pulling forward specific plan, cost rationalization projects for various selected businesses and functions. And then, finally we can’t lose sight of the fact that we’ve to continue to improve our localized production and component supply over the long-term. These actions are all well represented in our 2015 guidance as significant tailwinds. All these factors are how we manage a difficult currency environment with a proactive approach that ensures we generate solid earnings growth while balancing our requirement, continuing to invest for future growth. Now let's move to the summarize -- the summary page of our presentation. We are very pleased with our strong 2014 EPS and cash flow performance, despite significant FX pressure and emerging market volatility. We achieved many of the objectives we established in early 2014 such as strong organic growth of 5% supported by innovation and the growth investments continue to blossom [ph]. Tight cost controls and surgical price actions across the entire Company enabled excellent operating leverage to emerge in our P&L. Security Europe continues to perform better and made solid progress on its multi-year transformation. Debt leverage -- leveraging target -- deleveraging targets were met and we took a modest step towards our $1 billion share repurchase program in Q4. And then we exceeded our cash flow return on investment goal and ended the year at the low-end of our long-term range of 12% to 15%. Our focus in 2015 will continue to be on improving the near-term returns and relative performance through the organic growth initiatives, security margin improvement, cost and pricing actions, ongoing working capital focus and the continued rebalance of our capital allocation. We believe this approach will continue to be successful in 2015 and beyond as it positions our Company to deliver on the long-term financial objectives we’ve established. This concludes the presentation portion of the call. And let’s move to Q&A.
Gregory Waybright: Great. Don, thank you. John, we can now open the call to Q&A, please.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on your kind of growth this quarter. Just wanted to focus on price here and -- in light of the raw material deflation, have the discussions with your key customers change in any materially way? And on top of that, given the currency move, have you seen any change in behavior from your European and Japanese competitors?
James M. Loree: So this is Jim. The deflation at this point is not material. It’s significant, but not material, and its spread over many, many different businesses and product lines and so forth. So, for any given skew or any given product line, it’s probably no more than a point or two of the total selling price. And we don’t -- we don’t entertain price adjustments unless there is really material inflation, that’s when the customers will get more interested in doing that. And likewise it works the same way on the other side when we have inflation. We don’t pursue inflation based price increases with our major customers until it becomes material. So it’s a -- there is a healthy understanding that for these types of immaterial moves that we don’t rock the boat, if you will. So that’s the kind of approach there. As long as it kind of continues at this pace, we’re looking at maybe $40 million, $50 million of deflation across a 12 -- almost a $12 billion revenue base. And then, the second part of the question …?
Gregory Waybright: Well it was on behavior from our European and Japanese customers [indiscernible] it’s important to note where their production is. So, go ahead James.
James M. Loree: So, if you look at Bosch and Makita everybody has global footprints with concentration in China. And most folks are using either renminbi or dollar denominated currencies to basically set purchase prices, so -- or the -- and the manufacturing costs are obviously established in those regions as well. Now, so then you take Makita, well Makita has more Japanese manufacturing than say some of the others. Bosch has more European manufacturing than the others. So I’d say it’s probably for them some opportunity to shift some production to these areas where the currency has gone down. But recognize that in both Japan and in Europe that the labor rates are exceptionally high relative to the emerging markets. So it really takes some pretty significant currency movements on a sustained basis to make it a practical reality for them to be able to shift a lot of manufacturing. And we also have a fairly substantial ability to shift production into Europe with our manufacturing footprint there. We really don’t have much of a Japanese footprint at all. So, there is some movement that’s possible. I think it’s really at the margin and not really a significant impact.
Operator: Our next question is from Tim Wojs from Baird. Please go ahead.
Timothy Wojs: Yes. Hi, guys. I guess, just to talk about the CDIY outperformance there. I think in the press release you talked about share gains. I’m just curious where the share gain is coming from? Is it more shelf space at retail or is it better sell-through, is it just better product? Maybe just a little bit more color there and then maybe what's in the pipeline around sustaining that growth rate as we get into 2015?
John F. Lundgren: Yes, Tim, this is John. The answer is all of the above. You saw the organic growth rate particularly in Europe where the market is flat at best. And as Jim pointed out in his segment overview, we’ve had six consecutive quarters of organic growth averaging 7%. So when you’re growing 7% in the market that’s growing 0% to 2% on a very best case, there’s a significant share gain in Europe. We’re gaining share in U.S. Again, I think Jim gave some of the wide, but to help we’ve recouped all of the lost share when legacy Black & Decker was a little bit slow, but for very good reason that we’ve talked about to convert from NiCad to Lithium-ion. That share gain has been -- that share loss has been completely recaptured and we’ve got the offense on the field specifically with the brushless initiative that Jim talked about. That represents about 20% of the market and we’ve about 40% of it. So that’s driving particularly our top professional power tool gains in North America. I think the other bright spot specifically is, is sell-through. On occasion this time if you’re our -- our customers it’s quite well-known. Keep a very close eye on their inventories in the month of January because that’s the end of their fiscal year. January tends to be a slow shipment month and we make up for some of that in February and March. The sell-through was outstanding in December and January. So it’s sell-in and sell-through which translates to share gains. Again, when our organic growth is about 2x the rate of the market it has to be share gain as long as it’s selling through. Lastly, it’s been overwhelmingly driven by both ongoing and arguably breakthrough, new product introduction. Our vitality index is in the 30s which is quite high for a business of that nature. Both in Europe and the U.S., the sources has been a little bit different. U.S. has been professional power tools primarily. Europe it’s been right across the board. Hand tools, power tools and even home products, some tremendous innovation in a segment of the business or sub-segment that’s more important in Europe than it is in the U.S. But doing particularly well and the words in the press release said expanded customer relationships, that’s exactly what that means. We’ve gotten new distribution with customers particularly in Europe but elsewhere, expanded shelf space and new distribution displacing both competitors and in some cases private label that’s also helped that growth. So simple answer all of the above, but that gives us a lot more color on where it’s coming from.
James M. Loree: And maybe just to follow on very briefly. When you take last year, $300 million of revenue from new product introductions in CDIY over a 1000 skews and then put those new products to work by leveraging them across our -- what I call in my comments, our leading array of brands. But the flexibility that we’ve with our brands with DeWalt, with Black & Decker, with Bostitch, with Stanley FatMax which is growing significantly, Porter Cable and so on. The ability to leverage those new products across those brands and then across the global geographies at the same time with a scale that we’ve managed to put together with both hand tools and power tools in the global footprint of the company, that’s how we’re doing it. And then the other term I used was commercial excellence. We’ve committed to commercial excellence, and that means all those cylinders in that commercial engine are hitting at the same time. You put all that together and that’s what we’ve created is this commercial machine which is out there gaining share in many, many different places around the world.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, Jim thanks for that. And just without being more specific than we need to be on this call, just one anecdote or great example of what Jim talked about. Stanley FatMax power tools, certain North American customers and certain large retail customers elsewhere in the world, it’s the fast -- one of the fastest growing power tool brands in the market and four years ago that didn’t exist, because Stanley didn’t have the capability to make a power tool that would merit or justify putting the FatMax name on it. And its as Jim suggested, it’s a tremendous synergy from a merger that’s now four years, almost five in the rearview mirror, but still continues to show some great results in terms of our top line opportunity and brand penetration.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeremie Capron from CLSA.
Jeremie Capron: Hi, good morning. A question on the reorganization that you talked about, in terms of combining the various tools businesses under a single umbrella. Can you give us a little more detail in terms of the timeline here and what's the ultimate goal that we’re looking at a single business division for IAR and CDIY? And the second leg to this question relates to the charges that were booked in the fourth quarter. It looks like you booked more charges than guided just three months ago, is this related to that combination or anything else in there?
John F. Lundgren: Yes, this is John. I’ll talk about the combination and Don can give you the specifics on the charges. You’re directionally right, but your logic is -- you don’t have quite all the background, but Don will touch on it. Look, the combination just makes tremendous sense. It isn’t the entire industrial segment importantly and CDIY. It’s our industrial tool business and our professional tool business, specifically the IAR business and industrial storage combined with CDIY to take -- to make about a $7 billion business and clearly the largest tool business in the world with leading positions in all four vertical markets as Jim discussed in his comments. I think very importantly there are modest cost savings associated with that which tail in comparison to the revenue synergies that was on in two areas. The combination of best practices in new product development, our product review board process and everything we do to reflect customer input and marketplace needs to more quickly develop, commercialize and introduce and sell-through new products across both of those businesses will be a tremendous advantage, secondly to apply technology that’s applicable or formally utilized in one business to the other and lastly the commercial excellence that Jim talked about, best people, best practices in each and every channel. So in this particular case, we’re very good at taking cost up, we’ve proven that. There will be some backroom efficiencies as a result of this. The driver here though is top line synergy, organic growth by combining the best of the best, not just similar, and we think of it as the next step in the evolution of the merger of Stanley Black & Decker. And there was enough going on that this natural, if you will, internal combination; it would have been premature to try to do that before now. We’re going to do it now. It will be reflected in our segment reporting going forward. Let me have Don talk about that a little bit and then give you a little more granularity on the charges.
Donald Allan: Yes. So, as John just touched on, the segment reporting for the Company will change in the first quarter 10-Q because the completion of this combination of the two businesses will happen in the first quarter. So, we’ll still have three segments. We’ll have a tools and storage segment which will include CDIY and IAR. We’ll have an industrial segment which will include Engineered Fastening in our infrastructure businesses, and then we’ll have Security in the current format, so not a dramatic change just moving one business into another in that change. Related to restructuring specifically, we indicated in the October earnings call that, we were evaluating additional restructuring of up to $10 million to $25 million beyond the initial guidance of $25 million. We actually recorded about $54 million in the fourth quarter, so it was at the high-end of that range. So it was very close to our expectations. A portion of that was related to the combination of these two businesses. A lot of the charges that took place in the fourth quarter were more associated to the U.S. activities, and what's going to occur in 2015 are more related to European activity.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.
Richard Kwas: Hi, good morning everyone.
John F. Lundgren: Good morning.
Richard Kwas: Just a question around guidance, in terms of the CRC-Evans business, what type of decline are you assuming within industrial given the lower oil prices and that’s obviously a high margin business, so there is some margin impact. And then second, are you assuming any benefit within CDIY or even industrial with regards to the lower oil prices, meaning demand benefit or is that assumed to be potential optionality in terms of the organic growth guidance for the year?
Donald Allan: Hi, Rich. It’s Don, I’ll take that. As far CRC-Evans goes, as John or Jim mentioned, just first of all a reminder, it is 3% of our total revenue just to give you a size -- sizing of it. It is considered a small pressure to us year-over-year. We do expect that business to probably see 10% or 20% of revenue decline, ’14 versus ’15, and it’s really just due to what we’ve seen of this halting of all the activity around construction pipeline or constructions of the pipeline. But frankly it’s not a very material impact to us, but it does have a marginal impact. Related to your question around gas prices and oil prices and how does that, could that have a positive impact on buying activity in CDIY or industrial and whether we factored that? We have not specifically factored that into our guidance. It’s something that certainly will evaluate as time goes on over the next 12 months, but right now that’s not specifically factored into our guidance.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse.
Patrick Murray: Hi, good morning. This is Patrick Murray on for Mike. So with respect to the FX headwinds, if we’re to see any incremental U.S. dollar appreciation over the course of the year, how much more opportunity beyond what you have incorporated into 2015 guidance do you see is opportunities to offset any incremental U.S. dollar strengthening?
Donald Allan: Yes, I think we -- as I mentioned in my comments, we’ve done a lot of hedging activities to try to minimize the future impact. But if the dollar continued to strengthen versus all our major currencies like it has been over the last 30 days, there would be an impact. I gave an example of the euro where, if the euro did move to parity over the next five months, i.e. but he middle of the year, that would probably be about $12 million to $15 million additional headwind to us. So, certainly we’ve looked at those different sensitivities and scenarios and their possibility. As far as how we offset them, yes we have evaluated different options and -- if you remember that slide as I walk through, what we do, we first look at pricing with our customers in certain markets where we’re importing the products. So, if there’s changes related to those currencies we have to evaluate whether we want to go back with additional price increases. The second was commodities. So, if that environment generates more commodity deflation, do we have additional opportunities that we could go after with our suppliers, and then the third area was, cost rationalization? I don’t think there is a huge opportunity in that particular category, but there are few things that we could do if we saw a continued pressure around foreign currencies. So, I think we’ve done enough sensitivity analysis to feel comfortable that we can deal with a reasonable level of continued strengthening over the next three to six months.
John F. Lundgren: Yes. And I think to kind of remove the focus from three to six months which is, not what we’re hear to do necessarily, although I know its an important part of trying to build your model. Don, I think was -- hopefully was very helpful in talking about an equal split translation versus transactional. This year it was about, 2014 the FX impact was about 60% transactional, 40% translational. Next year it’s about 50-50, meaning a little less of it is in our control. On the transactional piece, Don talked about everything we can do short-term. Long-term, we were on a global supply chain network that I think Jim described quite eloquently, and the issue is moving sources of supply to the lower cost countries whether its commodities, labor costs, general cost to manufacture. The issue with that in the short-term that I think it’s important to understand, we make premium products in 70% of what we make in terms of tools or 67% are bought by people who do it for a living. The quality standards are extraordinarily high, and it’s very difficult to qualify material or component suppliers in places like Latin America and certain Asian markets quickly. So, despite the fact that opportunity exists, you can rest assure that our supply chain folks are working diligently and vigorously to qualify new suppliers on a longer term basis to allow us more flexibility to shift production -- meaningful pieces of production to weaker currency markets. But that’s something that happens over one to two years, not three to six months, and it’s just an important distinction not to understand.
Operator: Our next question is from Wini Clark from UBS.
Winifred Clark: Good morning. You noted your organic growth expectations are being muted in ’15 versus ’14 by headwinds outside the U.S. Can you talk a bit about what you’re expecting from emerging markets specifically, because while volatility continues their comps are not particularly difficult, and it seems like your MPP initiatives are gaining some momentum.
James M. Loree: Yes, it’s Jim. We think that the emerging markets, all else equal in terms of no major change from where we are today, in terms of the environment. It will be slightly higher than our overall line average growth outlook. So, probably mid-single digits pushing, well maybe a little higher than that, but right in that kind of a range.
Operator: And our next question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.
Jeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. We almost reached the milestone, and no security questions on the call, but I’m sorry, I’ll flip one in.
John F. Lundgren: Thank you. Nobody was listening.
Jeffrey Sprague: Yes, it’s nice that you didn’t have to spend that much time on it. But could you give us a little bit more detail on how attrition is running? Where you’re at on the commercial initiatives? And any color you can share just kind of on the sale process for Italy and Spain?
John F. Lundgren: Yes, we’re in a good place on all of those. We’re not going to get ahead ourselves on Italy and Spain for obvious reasons, NDAs and things of that nature. I think Jim can give you a lot more granularity on attrition and a few of the other positive momentum.
James M. Loree: I think as most people on the call that have been following us know that, we made tremendous progress on attrition in Europe in the last 12 months and really have put in real process. We have people, measurement systems that are tracking it, people that are accountable to manage it. And the results reflect the improvements that we’ve made with respect to the process. And so, getting to that 12% which was something that we put out there when we were running 17%, 18%, we did that within a year. That’s a huge, huge achievement because it enables us to actually have the opportunity to grow now. And what I mean by that is, with -- I’m taking Europe as an example. With recurring revenue as 40% of total revenue, if you are trading at close to 20% rate, you’re digging an 8% revenue hole every year before you even start originating new business. And so, when you get down to 10% to 12% which is more of the industry average, you have a hole that’s substantially smaller closer to 4% of total revenue, and you need order growth in the kind of -- in that range to be able to be flat if you will, and that’s kind of where we are now, where you saw the flat performance in Europe in 4Q. Now what we have to do here is, sustain the attrition at these levels which we think is very doable, and from there we have to kind of rev up the origination machine, but do it in a way where we are going after profitable business and not just cutting prices to get the business, because the other little variable in this whole equation is making sure that the gross margins that you’re taking on with a new business are high enough so that you don’t kind of depress the overall gross margins of the business. And I think the team fully understands that over in Europe. We have new management in place as of the fourth quarter. It’s actually a guy that was the Chief Operating Officer for about a year over there, so he’s very familiar with the situation. We’ve got country -- we’ve got the country managers making a pretty good place. Everybody knows what their plan is. We have the one issue that was operationally impossible to manage because of the market trends and structural issues which was Spain is now as you know going to be divested. And so, I think the table is set for what I described in my comments as, moving forward. We’re going to move forward, I wouldn’t expect substantial growth out of Europe in the next couple of quarters, but I would expect to see it positive. And as we continue to make progress, then we will start to bring in some of these vertical solutions from the U.S. and that’s when you can really expect to see the growth start to really rev up in Europe and become more consistent with what we’d have expected when we purchased Niscayah. So that’s sort of the lay on the land on that one.
John F. Lundgren: You asked about process in Spain and Italy, and let me just say two things because, as I referenced before Jim spoke, we are just not in a position to provide a lot of insight on it due to NDAs and things of that nature. We’re very comfortable saying, we’ve got a great term in place, and it’s a good combination of tested and proven senior Stanley security leaders with some good help from our corporate business development team to oversee that process. The other thing, we’ve broken this out, recognized that Spain is 5, 6, 7 times the size of Italy relative to the size of the business and where the focus is. And as you know Jim alluded to, well our business was heavily focused on the financial institutions vertical and probably a third of the bank branches in Spain have closed in the last year and it’s a very difficult competitive environment. So we know it’s the right decision for the company. We do have a good team in place, process is underway, but that’s all we’re going to -- in a position to say about it for reasons that I know you’ll understand and respect.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital.
Mike Wood: Hi, thank you. If I exclude the rest of the buybacks that you called out, the mid-point of your GAAP earnings is up about 5% from what you did in 2014. I’m curious with the free cash flow guidance you gave which is a starting point of 1% growth. Is there anything dragging down on cash flow growth next year, higher CapEx or any kind of working capital progress that you can discuss? Or should it more closely near the GAAP earnings growth?
Donald Allan: I think when you look at cash flow for 2015; we have to factor in a couple of things. One, yes, there will be a little bit higher levels of CapEx, but nothing really dramatic and material. However the working capital component will be less of a positive and frankly is a modest negative next year, because what happens as you continue to grow, you have to basically get half a turn or a full turn improvement in your working capital turn just to get a positive impact in the cash flow statement. And as we get closer and closer to 10 turns which is a great thing, the amount of year-over-year benefit or improvement in turns is going to be smaller. And so, next year we might get three times, five times of a turn improvement in our working capital turns. But that actually will create -- could create a negative in cash flow depending on where revenue ends up. I know that’s really a big driver there. We don’t look at that as a major issue, its just one of the benefits of the great success that we’ve seen in working capital turns. And we still think cash flow is a great story, and will continue to be going forward.
Operator: And our last question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays.
John Coyle: Hi, guys, its John filling in for Steve today. Just kind of the commentary that we got over the course much of 2014 relating to the R&R [ph] market just that it was one of moderating year-over-year, but your sales in CDIY really accelerated over the course of the year. So, can you talk about maybe some specific product categories that you’ve seen for CDIY, and then was your commentary that sell through was strong in the fourth quarter meant to signal that these trends have persisted into the first quarter of ’15? Thanks.
James M. Loree: Well, I assume you’re talking about the U.S. because the R&R [ph] data I think typically that what you look at comes from the U.S. I think all you have to do is look at the DIY performances from the major customers to understand that the R&R [ph] market is alive and well, yes the -- at least in the home centers. And if you look at housing starts, yes we’ve had some nice improvement there, and we know that over time that we kind of benefit from that as well. I mentioned that the U.S. demand in DIY is strong and it is, and our POS is even stronger than the underlying demand. And so, as a consequence as we finish out the year, our inventory levels are down about a week in retail over where we would normally expect them to be, which is just indicative of when you have sales of 14% positive organic growth in North America, nobody is going to plan for that, and I think that’s what, why you see that. Now as far as specific categories, its really -- if you go back to the professional power tools being up 20%, and I think that could be a clue as to, where the most significant growth has been, and a lot of that has to do with the cordless market and in specifically the DC brushless market. And so, I think its really flying off the shelves, and it’s a great -- and it’s a completely redesigned tool, and its price value combination is very, very competitive. Its performance characteristics really are untouchable in the market right now with -- by the competitors, and it does it at a price that is reasonable, slightly above competition. And that’s a driver, it’s not the only single -- it’s not the single driver, but it’s an important one. And really as John said we made tremendous progress in cordless in general over the last four years. And gaining back all that share that was lost in kind of the ’08, ’09, 2010 period, and so a combination of those things I think is just -- and growing, improving exceptionally strong relationships with the large customers at this point of time, very constructive relationships.

Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 Stanley Black & Decker Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is John. I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright.
Gregory Waybright: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, are John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review our third quarter 2014 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Because of the size of the queue, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. I am really pleased with the performance of our team in the third quarter, given what's going on in the geopolitical front and many others. Let's get right into it. Organic growth of 6% was led by CDIY and our Industrial business, and the combination of the 6% growth, sharp cost focus and price realization delivered strong operating leverage. Our OM rate expanded to a post-merger record of 14.1%, that's x charges, of course, and 120-basis-points increase versus 2013. Diluted EPS, up 12% versus 2013 to $1.55, $1.50 on a GAAP basis. And please note the convergence of GAAP and reported EPS as the large acquisitions, accompanied by outsized restructuring charges, are more fully integrated and the overwhelming majority of that is now behind us. CDIY revenue grew 10% organically, another post-merger record of 16.5% operating margin rate as volume leverage, productivity, price and cost actions offset the continued foreign exchange and emerging market headwinds that you'll hear more about later in today's call. Industrial delivered 5% organic growth, 15.9% operating margin, and that's up 170 basis points. And the turnaround in Security, Europe continues. At the same time, we're taking some further actions to strengthen the global Security business as well as sharpen our focus on our vertical market solutions activities. And Jim Loree is going to give you a lot more detail on Security, in general, and vertical markets, in particular, when he gets into the segments. Free cash flow is $189 million in the third quarter and remains strong. Year-to-date, it's up $464 million versus 2013. And as a consequence of the earnings performance in the third quarter cash flow, we're raising our fiscal year free cash flow guidance and reiterating the earnings midpoint while tightening the 2014 EPS range. We're looking at approximately $800 million of free cash flow for the year and EPS of $5.52 to $5.58. Let's turn to the sources of growth during the quarter. The developed markets showed great strength, and they led the way this quarter as both CDIY and Industrial performed well in the U.S. as well as Europe. And remember, those 2 geographies account for 74% of our total revenue. Pricing in the emerging markets, as well as surgical pricing actions elsewhere in -- primarily in our developed markets, led to a 1% overall increase. And pricing offset the negative foreign exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar against virtually every currency. More to come on that in the fourth quarter as we think this is going to continue, and Don will get into that in far greater detail in his piece of the presentation. Within the regions, U.S. demand remains healthy in both retail and industrial channels. Overall demand in Europe is flat with the exception of the U.K. and several smaller countries. So the 4% growth that you see in Europe is clearly the result of share gains. Emerging markets remained under pressure, most notably Venezuela, Russia and Brazil, but we're really encouraged that the recent mid-priced products that we launched earlier this year are gaining a tremendous amount of traction. More on our recent product launches, as well as the current initiatives in those markets, as Jim dives into the segments. So in the interest of time, let me turn it over to him.
James M. Loree: Okay. Thanks, John. Let's start with CDIY. It was a blockbuster quarter for organic growth in the developed markets with double-digit performances in both North America and Europe, overwhelming a second consecutive slow growth quarter, in this case, 2% in the emerging markets, for a total performance of 10% globally. CDIY operating margin grew 19%, achieving another post-merger record rate of 16.5%, and margin gains resulting from volume leverage, modestly positive price, operations productivity and tight SG&A cost management overcame currency pressures. Last quarter, in my remarks, I said, and I quote, "So as we step back from the CDIY picture, we see a very healthy franchise with world-leading brands, broad and deep global distribution, delivering record margins. As we look forward, we have tremendous NPI momentum in both developed and developing markets and a cost structure that is poised for operating leverage." That is, in fact, exactly what our CDIY team delivered in bigger proportions in North America and Europe than even we expected. Across the global product lines, strength was broad-based with growth in Professional Power Tools, Consumer products, Hand Tools & Storage and Fastening & Accessories, each in a range from 8% to 11%. As the cover page indicated, CDIY new product development momentum is driving both revenue and profit growth. DeWalt DC brushless, an important and growing segment of cordless, is off to a very strong start. A host of other examples around the globe, ranging from highly innovative products, such as the first-in-world cordless electric pneumatic nailer and the Autosense drill, as well as practical products, such as the new designed in the market for the market, emerging market power and hand tool lines, all contributed. Putting the company's leading array of brands to work across categories also continues to produce strong results with examples such as DeWalt storage, adhesives and hand tools, Stanley FatMax power tools and Porter Cable hand tools all registering gains. Although difficult to quantify exact incremental revenue from these types of activities, we're confident that contributions from our NPD effort yielded 3 to 5 points of global growth benefit in the quarter. In the U.S., our Built In The USA program, which promotes tools assembled in our U.S.-based production facilities, including our recent plant addition in the Carolinas, has been highly successful. The U.S. business also enjoyed a kicker from an unexpected 3Q appearance of the outdoor season initially thought to be lost to weather back in the second quarter. On top of these benefits, underlying U.S. tool demand remains solid as DIY fundamentals are strong even as new construction markets are choppy but positive. So to sum up North America, exceptional growth execution and a good underlying market led to great 12% organic growth. And now moving to Europe where the market fundamentals are weak but the performance is equally as impressive. As I said last quarter, we couldn't be happier with the progress that the CDIY European team is making with organic growth up 11%, representing a 6-quarter streak with growth averaging 7% in one of the more consistently stagnant economic regions within the developed markets. This sustained performance is indicative of clear market share gains stemming from intensive NPD, new listings at retailers and distributors and a high-performance commercial team, which refuses to succumb to a victim mentality in a weak market. The other growth challenge in the quarter, emerging markets, up 2% organically, was one of continuing high volatility in the face of generally slower markets. It was a quarter in which Latin America, about half of our emerging markets' tools business, once again grew only 2% with Brazil flattish while issues in Venezuela and the western mining-dependent countries essentially offset stronger performances in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Central America. The other half of the emerging markets portfolio was also up only marginally as modest rebounds in Russia, Turkey and India were offset by weakness in China and Southeast Asia, to a lesser extent. Our major NPI foray into mid-price point power tools and hand tools across these markets is hitting the sweet spot for end users at a time when they tend to be more cost-conscious with their purchases. The program is thus tracking to plan but generally cutting into distributor's share of wallet as tougher markets create constraints on distributor willingness and ability to finance incremental inventory levels. As we look ahead for CDIY in total, we see the continued benefit of forward momentum with the winning combination of global scale, robust NPD, great brands, a growth culture and a tight rein on margins and cost more than compensating for lackluster markets in Europe and some of the emerging regions as well as a strengthening dollar environment. In that vein, we expect what is already an excellent CDIY growth story to continue. Now turning to Industrial. Industrial this quarter, once again, performed well and delivered respectable 3x operating leverage off of 5 points of organic growth with 17% growth in operating margin. The rate came in at 15.9%, up 170 basis points versus a year ago as price, productivity, SG&A control and volume all contributed to the performance. Both Industrial & Automotive Repair and Engineered Fastening delivered strong OM growth, up 29% and 19%, respectively. For IAR, organic growth of 7% benefited from strong demand in developed countries. North America was solid at 9%. Europe was up 11 points and still up an impressive 7% when adjusting for a prior year SAP conversion, which resulted in a 4-point easier comp. IAR Europe enjoyed strength in virtually all regions, driven by strong NPD and commercialization activities. Emerging markets were only modestly positive, the latter impacted by the same type of market issues as CDIY. Engineered Fastening was also up 5% organically with automotive up 16%, significantly outpacing global light vehicle production, which was up 5%. The Industrial portion of Engineered Fastening was flattish with sales to electronics OEMs weighing down a positive performance in industrial distribution. Infrastructure was down 1% organically with oil and gas down 4% and hydraulics up 7%. In total, it was another overall strong quarter for Industrial with a similar story shaping up for fourth quarter. Moving to Security. Revenues were down 3% with organic growth down 2 points and operating margin at 11.0%, down 12% and 120 basis points year-over-year. North America emerging markets was up 1% organically with Europe down 7%. North America emerging markets organic growth was modestly positive in both Convergent and Access Technologies, partially offset by a decline in Mechanical Access. Operating margin was essentially flat with last year. The OM rate was also consistent with the year ago, solidly in the mid-teens and just slightly shy of historical norms. Installation of a large vertical market retail win in North America, which has substantial future recurring revenue content, coupled with lower sales in the higher-margin Mechanical Access business, produced a less than desirable operating margin result in the quarter. Vertical market order progress continued to be a bright spot. In the spirit of allocating management resources where they are positioned to optimize their contribution to business success, several recent management adjustments have been made in North America in emerging market Security. Jim Cannon, a proven Stanley Black & Decker management veteran who has previously led both Oil & Gas and IAR, including responsibility for the Mac turnaround, has been named president of the unit. Brett Bontrager, who is succeeded by Jim, has been named to lead Global Vertical Markets, where he will continue to leverage his strength in developing these markets and winning customer accounts in North America while coordinating the transfer of Vertical Solutions to Europe as well. And then finally, Joe McCormack, another seasoned Stanley Black & Decker leader with extensive experience leading distribution commercial teams, has assumed leadership of Mechanical Access. We expect these changes to enable the continued forward progress of the Security North America and emerging markets team in both revving up organic growth and tightening operational execution. Moving to Security Europe this quarter. Performance was stable and consistent with commitments, extending its recent track record of predictability. OM is now in the mid-single digits, once again, improving sequentially this time by approximately a point. 3Q attrition came in within the target range of 10% to 12%, and order rates were up in the high single digits. This is an important calculus and that we will be looking for an easing of negative organic growth in the first half of '15 and then a flattish second half of '15 in order to continue to drive forward OM rate growth and a business turnaround. Finally, as mentioned last quarter, of the 14 country P&Ls in Europe, 12 are now considered stable or improving and only 2, Spain and Italy, representing 10% of the European portfolio, are still facing both significant structural and operational headwinds. We are committed to completing our strategic review of these countries in Q4, and you could expect a decisive solution dealing with the issue in the near future. So while Security still has a ways to go, especially in Europe, we are confident that we are in the right track, and our recent actions will continue to improve the probability of success. And with that, I will turn it over to Don Allan for some commentary on the financials, including the total year outlook and some preliminary thoughts on 2015. Don?
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. We are very pleased with our third quarter 2014 cash flow performance, which resulted in $189 million of free cash flow. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow performance was $355 million as we continue to benefit from increased operational earnings, lower restructuring payments and reduced capital expenditures. These 3 factors are responsible for the vast majority of our year-over-year improvement through the first 9 months. Additionally, we are also pleased with our third quarter working capital turns performance at 6.4x, which is up a half a turn versus the prior year. We believe this bodes well for us achieving our year-end goal of 8.5 to 9 working capital turns as we're looking for a half turn or better improvement versus the 2013 year-end. Many of you are aware that every year we experience a significant positive working capital benefit in the fourth quarter due to certain seasonality aspects of our CDIY business. As a result, we tend to generate close to 60% of our annual free cash flow in the fourth quarter. If you extrapolate our year-to-date performance through the third quarter, which is $355 million, and consider the fact that it indicates our free cash flow for the full year of 2014 will approximate $800 million. Considering all these factors I just mentioned, we are increasing our annual guidance for free cash flow to approximately $800 million from the previously communicated, at least, $675 million. This improved performance will ensure we will achieve our debt deleveraging goals for 2014 and then allow us to begin the previously communicated share repurchase program at some point in the fourth quarter. Now let's review our 2014 EPS outlook on Page 10. As indicated by John earlier, we are reiterating the midpoint of $5.55 while tightening our range, which is now expected to be $5.52 to $5.58. There are factors changing within our annual guidance which have an overall neutral impact on full year earnings. As a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar versus other key currencies, we now expect $75 million of currency pressure versus the previously communicated $60 million for the full year of 2014. However, offsetting virtually all of this new $15 million of Q4 currency pressure will be continued strong operational performance of several key businesses within CDIY and Industrial. This operational performance is being driven by solid organic growth in developed markets, strong cost controls over indirect costs and focused customer pricing initiatives, all the things that you heard from Jim a few minutes ago. An additional factor potentially impacting our annual guidance would be a modest benefit to earnings from the potential or possible reclassification of our Security Southern European business to discontinued operations. We will finalize this strategic decision in the later stages of Q4 and communicate it in the appropriate time frame. Let's turn to segments. We continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and solid operating margin rate expansion year-over-year in both the CDIY and Industrial segments, primarily due to volume leverage, solid price actions and cost controls, which are more than offsetting currency. Our Security segment will have a modest, organic revenue decline of for the full year, and the margin rate will decline modestly as well versus the prior year. The organic growth in North America and emerging markets will be more than offset by the declines we are experiencing in Europe, as Jim has discussed, based for the Q3 performance. Although headwinds have been somewhat unrelenting in 2014 due to currency pressures, combined with economic or political issues in emerging markets which have caused volume challenges, we believe we are taking all of the correct actions to combat these headwinds through cost-control actions and customer pricing initiatives. This approach will allow us to achieve strong operating leverage on solid organic growth, specifically, earnings will expand 13% on organic growth of 3% to 4% in 2014. We'd like to give you some thoughts on 2015. We see these currency and emerging market volume headwinds continuing and currently estimate it to be $50 million to $75 million against our 2015 operating profit growth expectation. Most of you know we have a track record of responding to these types of headwinds with focused cost-reduction actions or other profit-enhancing initiatives. And I think 2014 is a great example of this. We are currently considering several cost-reduction initiatives, which would largely, if not completely, offset these headwinds that we see for 2015 at this point in time. We're evaluating 3 areas for potential cost reductions: the first is combination of a few existing Stanley Black & Decker businesses to maximize the commercial go-to-market opportunities and, of course, leverage the back-office functions. In my mind, this would be a continued evolution of the Stanley and Black & Decker merger: number two, further cost rationalization of the Security businesses to improve profitability while enhancing our SG&A investments to stimulate growth within the verticals; and then three, other surgical actions and certain functions as well as corporate overhead. If we proceed with these actions, which I believe are highly likely, it will require additional restructuring charges of $10 million to $25 million in excess of our current 2014 estimate of $25 million. However, do not misinterpret our 2015 comments. We do expect solid growth in profit during 2015, and we are simply discussing one headwind we need to offset. Moving to the next slide, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing 2015 foreign currency impacts. As we are all aware, the U.S. dollar strengthened during late September against the 4 major currencies which impact us: the Canadian dollar, the European euro, Brazilian real and Argentinian peso. As a reminder, these transactional exposures primarily exist in our CDIY and Industrial businesses with 80% of it within CDIY. This is due to the extensive global supply chains that are in place as well as the importing of finished goods and components into Latin America and Canada in U.S. dollar-based transactions. We have finalized most of our initial key currency-hedging activities for 2015 at this stage. And based on yesterday's spot rates, we estimate the 2015 negative currency impact to approximate $45 million to $50 million versus 2014, which includes the impact of these recently executed currency hedges. To give you an example of the sensitivity of these 4 major currencies shown on the chart, a 1% movement of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar will result in approximately a $2.5 million to $3.5 million annual currency impact, and you can see examples of the other 3 currencies on the page. As I mentioned previously, we are focused on managing these types of headwinds with mitigating actions and are currently in the process of evaluating what these potential offsets could be. I believe this slide provides good transparency to the impact of currency in 2015 on our company. So I'd like to summarize the presentation portion of our call today. We are very pleased with the strong Q3 2014 EPS and cash flow performance. The strong organic growth of 6% mentioned by John has been supported by solid innovation and the 2013 growth investments continuing to blossom. The tight cost control and surgical price actions across the entire company enabled excellent operating leverage, and our operating margin expanded to a post-merger record. Security Europe continues to perform better and made another positive step forward in Q3. Our focus in 2014 continues to be on improving the near-term returns and relative performance of Stanley Black & Decker through organic growth initiatives, Security margin improvement, cost actions, pricing, ongoing working capital focus and, of course, the rebalance of our capital allocation through the end of 2015. Finally, we are preparing for new currency and emerging market volume headwinds with offsetting mitigating actions in 2015. So we continue to drive operating leverage as we grow revenue organically. We believe this approach in 2014, '15 and beyond positions our company to deliver on the long-term financial objectives we have established. That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Now let's move to Q&A.
Gregory Waybright: Great. Thank you, Don. John, if you would, we can now open the call to Q&A, please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Winnie Clark from UBS.
Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Could you talk a bit about -- a little bit more about the emerging market expectation continuing to be sluggish and now somewhat weaker in 2015? You quantify the dollar change in your expectation, but what does that translate to from an organic growth expectation? Does that impact your ability to drive 3% organic growth via your initiatives next year?
John F. Lundgren: Yes. No, a very fair question. Let me start at a higher level. Emerging markets, depending on exchange rates, accounts for 17% to 19% of our total revenue. So first and foremost, put that in perspective. Within the emerging markets, we didn't touch on specific geographies. But historically, as a group, these are growing in double digits, low teens and now they're growing at 2% and 3%. Specifically, certain markets, in our case, Venezuela, where we've had essentially no business for the last 12 months, that will anniversary which is nice in terms of our ability to grow. Argentina is difficult but continuing up. We've seen some bright spots in the last quarter. Brazil, it's much about currency and the economy, and of course, China, a very, very good -- switching to Asia. China, a big piece. We saw 7.3% GDP growth in the third quarter. That's encouraging. It's below where they have been, but better than of late. And of course, the geopolitical situations in Russia, Turkey, the Ukraine is impacting all of it. So at the end of the day, it's 17% of our volume. And if the markets are growing at 10% and we're gaining share -- maintaining share, excuse me, that's 170 basis points of organic growth. If they're flat, it's 0. So simply said, we have the products to go into those markets. We are certainly tempering our expectations for those markets in total, but that's what's baked into the kind of guidance that we've been able to provide thus far.
James M. Loree: And if you just think about it from a macro point of view, there clearly is a rotation of economic growth away from the -- in the short term, away from the emerging markets and more into North America, in particular, and Europe, kind of sort of -- expected to continue to sort of stay the same, maybe get slightly better. So we would expect to see the organic growth profile of the company mirror that economic growth rotation. So I would expect to see developed markets kind of -- and emerging markets converge for a period of time in sort of similar growth rates and then, over the long term, emerging markets to kind of ramp up again. We have taken considerable action in terms of product innovation and product development, brand development channel. We've made significant investments in the emerging markets. So we do think that we will be able to outperform the market or the economic performance of various countries. However, the volatility does remain high in the short term and are probably well for the medium to long term as well, but one has to be in these markets because these markets are the future. The 2/3 of the world's economic output and -- within 20 years will be from the emerging markets, and we will be there. So this is a -- this is not a period where one should get shy or cautious about being in these markets or second guess their strategy. This is a time to hunker down and gain as much share as possible.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, and thanks, Jim. And just to follow up because you only get the one question. I think 2 things. Jim's referring specifically to our feet-on-the-street advertising promotion efforts in those markets, but a greater importance, made in the market for the market to hit the right price points to get the products to the -- particularly to the distributors who are short on cash and thinking very hard about their purchase. So at the end of the day, think about the math. And in the appendix, if you're not familiar with it, we don't go through it in each presentation, but it'll just help you with the math that will give you every region of the country and the percent of Stanley Black & Decker revenue that, that region accounts for. So if you're modeling, it'll just help you with kind of a weighted average and you can apply your own assumptions to the market. And to Jim's point, we will mirror that.
Operator: And our next question is from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Don, I just wanted to dig into your comment about currency with the hedges, about $45 million, $50 million headwind for '15, and you're mentioning the possibility of further actions this year to offset that. And so what I'm going to try to figure out is do the incremental actions you're considering offset the $45 million to $50 million? Or do we think about that as the total actions you've taken this year offsetting that headwind, potentially?
Donald Allan: The actions that we're -- that we are evaluating would offset the currency impact as well as the emerging market volume impact. So I -- we described a $50 million to $75 million headwind for 2015. Within that, there's a $45 million to $50 million currency pressure, and then the other component is the volume concerns that we were just talking about related to emerging markets. We're looking to take actions that would offset all of that.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.
Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just quickly on -- 2 questions. Don, I think you said buyback in Q1 because of higher cash flow. Just wondering why you wouldn't be aggressive here in Q4, given this is seasonally the strongest cash flow quarter. And then the second question, CDIY margin, 16.5%, very strong number. How should we think about this from a sustainable standpoint? I know there's some seasonality within the business, but just trying to understand as we think about '15, given the strong margin here this quarter.
Donald Allan: So the first question is, I said the fourth quarter, maybe there was a Freudian flip and the word first came out, but I did say fourth quarter. So we expect to start the repurchase in the fourth quarter. So our objective has always been, since the beginning of the year, would be that we would focus on deleveraging. We had about $300 million roughly of deleveraging we wanted to do. We believe with this outperformance of cash flow we will be able to adequately achieve that, and then we'll be able to move forward with our repurchase program at some point in the fourth quarter. As far as the cash flow and the seasonality comment, yes. I mean, when we look at the history of our CDIY business, it is -- it was a little muddy last year, I think because of some other dynamics. But every other year, post-merger, about 60% to 70% in some cases, of the free cash flow or working capital benefit occurs in the fourth quarter. And it's because of the timing of the different promotions and other activities related to the holiday season and the vast majority of those shipments occur in October, early November. And then the good news is we're able to collect a lot of those receivables. And then we ramp down our production in our plants, so our inventory levels are actually able to decline because we do -- the -- our major customers tend to have a weak first quarter because it is the winter months.
Operator: And our next question is from Ken Zener from KeyBanc.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: On the Security, it seem to be very specific in the U.S. on Mechanical, if I interpreted your comments correctly. So would you expand on that, if it was related to -- going to the distribution model, if it was aggressive behavior by a competitor? Or was it simply more misexecution?
James M. Loree: Well, the Mechanical issue is kind of the issue for North America and emerging markets Security in the quarter, without a doubt. The other issue, which is the CSS kind of efficiency and operating margin rate, is simply a one quarter blip, where we have a big installation of a huge vertical market customer project. So you do have that correct. And I'd say what we believe about the Mechanical business today is that we have selected the correct strategy, and we have attempted to implement it effectively for about 2 years now and, at some point, the -- once patients dwindles with execution. And we've made some mistakes along the way, and we expect that new leadership will tackle the project and get it right. So that's the impetus behind the management change, and we're looking forward to Joe's experience coming into this job and getting this right very quickly. We've studied the strategic elements and aspects of this in depth, and we see that as the right strategy. We've got the specifiers in place. We haven't seen any untoward competitive activity. The market is going to be good at some point in time. It's not bad right now. We're just not performing at that level. So we get to those situations and it's time to make a change.
John F. Lundgren: Just to add to what Jim said, the one thing you didn't mention is coming out of that is -- which as you know, is the largest annual Security trade show. It's not a product issue as well. The product is very, very well received. We're encouraged by that. So just to reinforce everything Jim said, plus we're -- not only do we feel the strategy is right, we're -- we feel we're in better shape than we've been in the past in terms of product offering. So it's up to us to execute.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just a question around Europe Security. I was wondering if you could provide us a little bit of granularity, maybe it's collectively, not by country. But in the -- what's going on in the 12 P&Ls you view as, at least, satisfactory versus the other 2? And what would actually be the gating decision to drop Spain and Italy into disc ops? I mean, the -- obviously, if you decide to exit, that might be one thing. But if you're looking at a sale, I wonder if you would consider dropping it into disc ops before you have an agreement on the exit.
John F. Lundgren: I'll take it, and Don can correct me on the accounting. Let me take the second part of your question first. We've said all we could say about whether or not -- what we said is we're evaluating it. We will have a decision in the fourth quarter, and we will communicate it. That is all we're going to say. It's all we're in a position to say for all the reasons that I know you understand. I respect the question. Please respect the fact that we're not able to provide any more insight on it, other than we want you to be aware we're not letting that issue fester. What I think is important to understand, we timed that and allow us to go through '14 P&L. We do report them. And the ones, the big ones that matter, U.K., France and Sweden, all performing pretty well and very near line average and historical margins. The math is really important, and it's interesting. We talked about Spain and Italy, which, together, from a revenue perspective, represent 10% of European Security; if you just cascade that with the math, which represents 4% of Stanley Security and 1% of Stanley Black & Decker revenue. Yet that region is accounting for 70 to 100 basis points of headwind or negativity to our Security margins. And quite frankly, that's just math. And it's 2 things going on, those are very competitive markets. They're difficult markets, as you can imagine. But secondly, particularly, Spain, which is 80% of that 10% or 70% of that 10%, the financial services industry, as you know, is in turmoil. Retail bank branches closing left and right. I'd be off -- I shouldn't speculate, at least 30% to 40% down. And that was our strength in Europe. So when you got -- very competitive in Spain -- so when you have a very competitive market that's 30% to 40% smaller than it was 1 year, 1.5 year ago, that's just tough sledding. So we're evaluating all the options in the best interest of our shareholders and of our employees in the company, recognizing the pros and cons of the 2 or 3 different alternative that you outlined. And when we're ready to -- when we're in a position to take a firm stance, you'll be among the first to know.
James M. Loree: Let me also just mention that another way to look at this situation, Security Europe, is -- and at the P&L, is that once you excise the Southern Italy part that we're talking about, the gross margin rate is north of 40%, and the operating margin would be a couple -- kind of in the mid to slightly above mid-single-digit range. So what that says is that the SG&A is quite high, and it's in the 35-plus-percent range, which is just too high for a Security business, no matter where it's located in the world. So it's very important that part of what Don mentioned in terms of this cost exercise that we'll be going through in the fourth quarter to yield profitability improvements in 2015, there will be a significant -- as he mentioned, a significant portion of it targeted at the Security Europe cost structure, and particularly, as it relates to the SG&A. And we will find a way to make some significant improvements in that structure, that cost structure so that we get the operating margin lift that comes with that. So I think is very encouraging, from my perspective, that the gross margin is north of 40%, once you get that Southern Europe portfolio excised.
Operator: And our next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays.
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to follow up a little bit on the CDIY. I think you talked about the outdoor previously as, I think, hindering you by about 2 points of growth. I think you mentioned that in either 2Q or 1Q. And I'm triangulating on that to be about $30 million impact. I was curious if you could give us some sense. Is that kind of in the ballpark of what you benefited from this quarter? Can you get it all back? Or just some color around that. And then what you think the incrementals on that look like? Is there a reason to think the incrementals there sort of higher or lower than the segment average typically?
James M. Loree: We -- just so -- just for clarity, we only got about 1/3 of that back. So it didn't even contribute -- it might round to a point, point of growth for CDIY, but it wasn't a significant an issue as -- or a benefit as it was a hurt in the second quarter. And incrementals are going to be pretty much consistent with the rest of the portfolio.
John F. Lundgren: Yes. Steve, outdoor -- just to quantify what Jim said, outdoor was up 2% VPY in the quarter, which was nice, but it's still down 3% year-to-date, emphasizing what Jim -- that helps to quantify what Jim just said. So despite a pleasant surprise in the third quarter, it didn't begin to fill the hole in the second quarter. It's just added a bit in the third.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Barry from Susquehanna.
Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I wanted to just ask about the vertical market solutions revenue in Security and how much revenue you're expecting that to contribute in North America in 2014. And wanted to also clarify the margins there, I know there was some mention of project mix headwinds in the quarter and some mention of -- perhaps that was related to a big vertical market install? I wanted to clarify that because I thought the margins on the VMS was higher. And then just finally, the latest thinking on bringing the vertical market solutions to Europe.
Donald Allan: Yes. I'll take that one. I think that was 4 questions in one and I'll have to break that down. So when we look at 2014 for the vertical market solutions, we've said throughout the year that our expectation is that we'd probably get pretty close to $100 million of revenue from these solutions during the year, and we're tracking relatively well to that at this stage of the year. So we feel pleased about how that's progressing. As far the gross margins, we've also said that they most likely will be accretive to the overall business. But you have to look at this across the entire contract. And what I mean by that is when you have large jobs like this, you have an installation component. And in the case of the third quarter, as Jim was describing the impact of a large job, we were doing the install, and we'll be close to finishing that here in October. But that does have a negative mix impact, but the profitability is lower on the installation. And then the recurring revenue stream starts later this year and continues into next year. And then when you look at the overall profitability of the entire job, it achieves the type of profitability we were describing before. And that's the way you have to evaluate it. I think it's important to remember that as we continue to focus on the vertical selling solutions, that we're occasionally going to have a quarter where we have a little bit of a mix challenge we have to work through when we have a large installation. But over the long term, these will be profit-enhancing activities.
John F. Lundgren: Simply said, you need to do the installations to keep the pump primed to generate the future recurring revenue. It's always a challenge to balance the -- balance the mix and balance the timing. But it's the nature of the business. And the larger the install, the more of a short-term challenge it is with the -- yet, at the same time, the greater the long-term reward.
Operator: And our next question is from Tim Wojs from Baird.
Timothy Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just on European CDIY, really strong growth there again. I guess what type of growth should we expect going forward there? I know you said new products and retail expansion has been a driver, I guess. But can you give us some color on what might be in the pipeline there? And especially if comps get more difficult in the 2015, what we should expect for growth?
Donald Allan: I'll take that one. So yes, we -- obviously, we talked about how pleased we are with the performance in CDIY Europe. Jim went through that in a great deal of detail. There's been a lot of activities around new product introductions, new customer listings, some new brands put on products that didn't exist before in the European marketplace, such as the Stanley FatMax brand on power tools, so some great examples of that. And I do think there's momentum to continue that into 2015 in the sense of having new product introductions, expansion of some of the things that we did in certain countries into other countries within Europe that we haven't penetrated yet. I wouldn't expect to see high single-digit revenue performance, but I do expect them to outperform the market as a result and continue to have share gains.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Wood from Macquarie Capital.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Research: I wanted to focus in on the CDIY business. The CDIY sales in North America for Stanley took a while to reflect the housing recovery, given there was a considerable lag. Now we're starting to see building product companies reflect more tepid growth in end markets that are slower compared to last year. What are you able to do -- or what are you planning to do proactively in the North American CDIY business to get out in front of the curve from a cost or share gain perspective?
James M. Loree: Well, I think what we're doing is exactly what we did in the quarter, which is we're basically driving new product innovation as hard as we ever have. As I said in my remarks, that new product innovation resulted in 3 to 5 points, at a minimum, of contribution to revenue growth.
John F. Lundgren: So 1/3 to 1/2 of the growth.
James M. Loree: Yes, which also drives profit growth because you mix into higher-margin new products. And so it's a growth -- it's an innovation machine right now, which is clearly -- I mean, I can guarantee you that there are significant share gains going on in the U.S. and in Europe and, frankly, globally. I mean, this business has grown its market share significantly over the last 4 years, and it will continue to do so. Now we don't see any near-term abatement in the CDIY business U.S. market. It is largely DIY-driven, much more so than new construction driven. New construction, when it hits and the lag occurs and so forth, that will be an added bonus. But we did not ride that curve up in the last couple of quarters, like some of the building products companies did, and we certainly aren't going to ride it down, having not ridden it up. So I wouldn't correlate us quite as closely to the building product companies as your remarks seem to imply as well.
John F. Lundgren: Yes. Just to help you, Mike, I think you're aware of this, perhaps not. For the 10, 11 years I've been here, and I think for the 100 years before that, we have been 3 to 9 months, so take the midpoint, 6 months, behind any significant change in North American residential construction. That's just the nature of our business, the wallboard folks and the timber folks and those who are involved in foundations, et cetera, are obviously at the beginning of that program, and we're closer to the end. So the lag, to use your words, not -- and Jim, I think, described it well. He just didn't put a number on it. That's been going on for 100 years, and we don't anticipate that it's going to change.
Operator: Our last question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
William W. Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's actually Will Wong on for Mike. Don, thanks for providing the additional color regarding the cost cuts. The company has initiated cost-cutting actions over the last 2 or 3 years to offset weakness in end markets as well as FX and we're just wondering how long this can continue without cutting into the core capabilities for growth and operations, but your license fees appear to be unplanned and reactive rather than proactive?
Donald Allan: Well, I think we -- for those -- as I mentioned, for those of you who have followed us over the years, we are very proactive about looking at certain headwinds we see and how we're going to react to it. And so you can describe that as reactive or you can describe it proactive. I look at it as proactive. At the same time, I look at our company and I see, every year, significant productivity programs that occur in the supply chain, productivity programs that incur in our SG&A costs that we never talk about. We just do those every year, and those are the more proactive things that you're describing. They need to happen to continue to enhance our profitability to allow us to deal with occasional periods of time when we have commodity price pressures, et cetera. We don't like to sit back and just let things come at us and then not do anything about it. Our response is to do something about it. And what we're basically saying is that we are going to take a proactive approach to a headwind that with -- become a reality in the last 30 days. And we're going to do it in a way that is surgical in nature. It's going to be a combination of continued evolution of the Stanley and Black & Decker merger. It's going to be the continued improvement of the Security profitability, Europe and -- specifically, as Jim and I both talked about it, and it's also going to be the continued enhancement of the efficiency and effectiveness of our functions and our corporate overhead. These are all things that we need to do every year and sometimes we accelerate some of these things to deal with headwinds that come at us quickly.
John F. Lundgren: Yes. And just, again, to quantify, we've said this before in a lot of calls, but what Don's talking about, the proactive or ongoing nature of our business, particularly to CDIY and IAR, for that matter, the tools business. It's as simple as -- and real prices have declined 1% to 2% a year, let's say, 1% for the last 15 years, real prices. We get price by mixing up, by being -- by mixing into higher-margin items and a good price discipline. But with gross margins round numbers of 35%, real prices declining 1% a year, if you don't get net 3% productivity every year, your margins would decline. Look at the math, our CDI margins are not declining. So if you exclude all the new headwinds to which Don's referring to, particularly foreign currency, emerging market growth, just to stay in the game you need 3% productivity every year to offset 1% real price declines, and we've been doing that for a long time. I think Don can account for 15 years of it.
Donald Allan: Yes.
John F. Lundgren: And that's just part of our DNA. That's part of SFS that we don't talk about too much. But I just kind of want to steer you away from anything we're doing, is we see something going wrong and the knee-jerk reaction is to fix it. That's a necessity, too. We wouldn't be where we were this year if we hadn't done a whole lot of those programs. As Don described, the level of unanticipated and uncontrollable macroeconomic headwinds we faced, yet we're plodding along with a pretty successful year relative to expectations.
Operator: Our next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Don, can you just talk a little bit about some of the cash flow items that are dropping below the free cash flow line? I think one seems to be on the head settlements and then there's a lot of grouped in the other line, about $200 million so far this year, and I think last year is about $30 million. Can you just maybe explain what those are? And then let us know if there's anything that you'd expect along those lines in fourth quarter or next year.
Donald Allan: Yes. The other line in operating cash flow is where you see the impact of all the reduced restructuring payments.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: And was it down on the -- in the financing investing side?
Donald Allan: Well, that would simply just be the activity around commercial paper and financing. And as we go through the year, we see fluctuations in there. We tend to increase our commercial lines, paper lines as the year begins because we have cash outflows in the operating levels. And then as the year goes on and we have our strong fourth quarter, as I described, that slowly and gradually goes away, and you'll see that this year. You do have some other type of currency and hedging activities that do happen below there, but we could certainly walk you through that in a little more detail off-line.
Operator: And our next question is from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: The question is -- the questions I have are really on the mid-price point. You mentioned that the launches are pacing to expectations. I guess the question is, are your distribution build-outs where they need to be? And Jim, I think you made some passing reference to some pressures that are being felt by some of those distributors. Can you just talk about what you might be doing to support those distributors, such that the fourth quarter and beyond isn't at risk in terms of the growth?
James M. Loree: Well, I mean, we're doing everything we can, obviously. We're not going to overextend our sales from a credit point of view with distributors in markets that are relatively volatile and weak. So there's only so much you can do in terms of financial support, and we're certainly not giving significant extended terms or anything like that. You'd certainly see that in the working capital if we were doing that. So what it really boils down to is distributor training and end user kind of support, so through advertising, through having feet-on-the-street, working with the end users to try to stimulate demand and construction projects, those types of things, creating awareness for the products in the market. But this is just going to take its course. We're not going to jam these products into channels. We're going to allow them to gradually kind of take root and let the products speak for themselves. And I'd say we've done a pretty good job about 1.5 years ago of sort of sprinkling the resources into the various markets. And what we're also doing right now is we've done a study of our sales force effectiveness in managing this distribution channel across all the different countries. And we're looking at the emerging markets right now as sort of a portfolio of countries, and we're saying, "Okay, we had -- we added about 300 feet-on-the-street, 200 salespeople, 100 marketing people during that time frame." And now we're kind of looking at that resource allocation and saying, "Okay, number one, where are the folks effective? And are there certain folks who are more effective than others?" Of course, there are, so some rank ordering, some performance evaluation, some changing out some of the folks who are nonperformers. And then the other piece of the activity is to look at some reallocation of resources based on the economic outlook for various countries. So for instance, we wouldn't want to have a -- an army of people in Venezuela trying to sell products when there's no market. So those type of resources could be reallocated to countries such as Colombia, which are -- which is very, very robust right now, so that kind of process, looking at the whole picture of doing the resource reallocation. So no incremental costs of any significance, however, more effectiveness. That's really what we're looking for. But this is not going to be a -- given the market status that we are in right now, this is not going to be a huge sensation. Don't look for 20% growth because of the new products or 10% growth. This is going to be -- will keep us in the game, drive market share quietly, market share increases steadily, methodically. And then when the markets come back, there'll be a lot more share for us and lot more growth.
John F. Lundgren: Yes. Importantly, Doug, the key is, as Jim said in his presentation, made in the market for the market. In our history, if you go way back, and you followed us a long time, we would make western-specification products, then we try to take 10% of the costs out and sell it for 20% less. And it was a strain on margin -- it's not quite that simple, but it was a strain on margin nor were the products at a price point that appealed to the distributors in some of these emerging markets where wage rates are so much lower and things of that nature. So the acquisition of GQ which we've talked about, leveraging that capability across a broader portfolio, our Design To Value program where we're truly starting with a blank piece of paper, building these tools from scratch with no extra cost or no extra feature that the end user isn't willing or able to pay for. That's what's driving this. And as I say, it's early days, but we're encouraged thus far.
Operator: Our next question is from Liam Burke from Wunderlich Securities.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division: IAR was very strong, particularly in Europe and the U.S. Was there any particular vertical that showed inordinate strength? Or did you just see strength across-the-board?
James M. Loree: I mean, there was -- I wouldn't say across-the-board. I mean, mining is still weak. But generally speaking, pretty strong. General manufacturing, very strong. But lot of strength in various verticals.
Operator: And our next question is from Jeremie Capron from CLSA.
John F. Lundgren: In Rich Kwas', I'll say, multi-faceted question, but it was an important one, and as Don was processing, he didn't get to it on the sustainability of CDIY margins. It's probably worth a word from Don before we close.
Donald Allan: Yes. So Rich was asking about the 16.5% margin we saw in Q3, what's the sustainability? What does it mean going into 2015? What I will tell you is that for this year, as I mentioned in the guidance, we'll probably see 60, 70 basis point improvement in the CDIY margins year-over-year, and it's due to a lot of the great things that Jim walked through and that we've discussed through the first 9 months of this year. We expect continued improvement in the margins going into '15. As we all know, quarters change and fluctuate. But on a full year basis, we would expect that we would continue to see improvement. I think the next step and hurdle is we want to try to move them towards 16%. We will see a little bit of pressure against them next year because of the FX that we talked about and maybe all the cost actions don't get allocated directly to CDIY. But even given that, I do expect to see some year-over-year improvement.
Operator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q2 2014 Stanley Black & Decker Incorporated earnings conference call. My name is Paulette and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor & Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.
Greg Waybright: Thank you, Paulette. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter 2014 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR portion of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's second quarter 2014 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A section. Because of the size of the queue, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release in our in most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John Lundgren: Thanks, Greg, and thank you, Paulette. Thanks to those of you listening in this morning for our second quarter call. During the second quarter, our organic growth of 1% was negatively impacted by the shortened North American outdoor product season as well as some volatility and slower growth in emerging markets. Each of those two factors was worth about $25 million in revenue or 100 basis points for a total of about 2 percentage points of growth of the combination of those factors. This being said, our sharp cost focus on price realization delivered some healthy growth as well as operating margin expansion despite some significant currency pressure. Currency was about a $20 million headwind in the second quarter, and that was in line with our expectations. And as you'll recall, it's slightly below the $25 million headwinds that we experienced during the first quarter. So about $45 million during the first half of the year thus far. Gross margin expanded 100 basis points versus prior year to 36.5%. And operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 13.7%. Diluted EPS was up 17% versus prior year to $1.43. And as the spread between reported and GAAP earnings narrows, that's $1.37 on a GAAP basis. You're going to hear a lot more about segments in just a few minutes, but just a couple of highlights on the segments. CDIY operating margin expanded to a post-Stanley Black & Decker merger record of 15.7%. Price productivity cost action more than offset currency and the previously mentioned outdoor product headwinds. Our Industrial segment delivered 3% organic growth and a very strong 17% operating margin, which was up 260 basis points versus second quarter '13. Security North America and emerging markets organic growth was 2%, and their 16.5% operating margin was up 310 basis points versus prior year, approaching the historical levels of profitability that that business has demonstrated its ability to achieve. And Security Europe turnaround took a very positive step as operating margin was 240 basis points sequentially. So based on the segment results, the net performance and the programs that we have in place in the second half of '14, some of which you'll hear a little bit more about today, we're going to increase our 2014 EPS guidance range and we are reiterating our cash flow guidance. Specifically, the EPS range of $5.50 to $5.60 ex-charges with at least $675 million of free cash flow, and that's inclusive of $250 million of one-time payments. Turning to our sources of growth, on our first quarter call, we communicated that we expected organic growth and total growth to decelerate modestly in the second quarter, based in part on prior-year organic growth comps of 6% and 9% in CDIY and Industrial respectively. And the addition of adverse impacts of the outdoor product softness and the emerging market volatility resulted in total organic growth of 1%. And there was no incremental growth via acquisitions in the quarter, all of which is depicted in the chart that's projected on the left. In terms of the regions, the US remains healthy, as POS exceeded shipments excluding outdoor across the board. CDIY share gains in Europe as well as solid performance in Industrial was partially offset by Security Europe volume softness. And it was a rocky and volatile road in emerging markets with geopolitical issues in Venezuela, Russia, currency in Brazil, all having impacts. But this being said, we remain quite optimistic based on the strength and efficacy of our mid product price range. Early indications are very good. Jim will talk a little bit more about that in just a minute or so. And in the gray area, you see a shaded portion called emerging market organization. The reason we differentiated that and we've shown the plus-3% in the second quarter versus the 1% is our emerging market organization, this is the area of the group of products and people and markets where we have focused our organic growth initiatives. And specifically, it excludes Engineered Fastening and our hydraulics and CRC infrastructure businesses. So I think it's just worthy of note that where we have focused and targeted the incremental investments to drive organic growth despite the market headwinds, we did achieve 3% in the second quarter. Let me turn it over to Jim who is going to do a deeper dive into some of the segments. Don is going to follow that with some guidance and a look at the cash flow.
Jim Loree: Thank you, John. Starting with the CDIY, it was an impressive quarter for margin expansion with the post-merger record of 15.7%. Achieved in the phase of flat organic revenue growth, an outcome which was about 4 points lower than expected organically for CDIY due to the weak outdoor product season and unusually volatile emerging market conditions that John referenced that we were able to absorb these two transitory growth issues in CDIY during the quarter, while handily beating consensus and upgrading our total year estimate is a testament to the underlying earnings power of the company. Even more encouraging, the outlook for CDIY organic growth in second half is strong with the resumption of mid single-digit growth and the operating leverage that goes with it. I will now address the two second quarter CDIY growth governors in a bit more detail. First, outdoor products. Some of you will recall that last year, the outdoor season selling was delayed in 1Q, mostly notably in March, due to cold weather, causing us a CDIY growth issue in the first quarter of 2013. The second quarter 2013 proceeded normally, but the season got off to a late start and in total was relatively soft based on historical norms. Given the easy comp this year, the big four retailers in the aggregate were relatively optimistic in first quarter about the overall season despite the unwelcomed cold weather conditions at the time. Plus orders and selling were both good in 1Q '14 against an easy comp for us. So no issue. However, as the cold weather persisted into second quarter, retailer sentiment regarding the season quickly were pessimistic and replenishments virtually ceased as they attempted to liquidate their high inventories of outdoor product. So instead of an outdoor quarter, which was expected to be up in the high single-digits right around 10%, we ended up with one that was down about 15%, which caused us 2 points of year-over-year growth in CDIY. That is now behind us. The other growth challenge in the quarter, emerging markets was simply one of unusually high volatility in the face of gradually slowing markets. It was a quarter in which Latin America, about half of our emerging markets tool business, grew only 2% with Brazil slightly negative as the World Cup became a huge market distraction and with zero sales in Venezuela once again. The other half of the emerging markets portfolio was impacted by Russia and Turkey, which were down 16% and 30% respectively. China was also quite slow. Normal indications are that the second half will be stronger for both tools emerging markets with our major NPI foray into mid price point power tools and hand tools hitting the market across the geographies as we speak, the Venezuela sales drag anniversarying in September and the outlook for Brazil and China looking modestly better. Now moving to a very bright spot in the second quarter organic performance, Europe. We couldn't be happier with the progress that the CDIY team is making there with organic growth up 7%, representing a five-quarter streak with growth averaging 6% in one of the more tepid economic regions among the developed markets. This represents clear market share gains stemming from both new listings at retailers and distributors as well as a deluge of NPI including great success with the XR brushless cordless product as well as multi-tools and steam products. Our four major product categories, professional power tools, consumer products hand tools and storage and fastening and assembly each averaged 500 new distribution outlets on a year-over-year basis. So as we step back from the CDIY picture, we see a very healthy franchise with world-leading brands, broad and deep global distribution, delivering record margins during a quarter in which organic growth was suppressed by a few unusual items. And as we look forward, we have tremendous NTI momentum in both developed and developing markets and the cost structure that is poised for operating leverage. Turning to Industrial. Industrial this quarter once again hit on all cylinders and demonstrated the kind of operating leverage that is achievable with a few points of organic growth. In this case, 3 points of organic growth and 1 point from acquisition yielded 22% growth in operating margin. The margin rate came in at 17.0%, up 260 basis points versus a year ago, as price, productivity, SG&A control and volume all contributed to the performance. Both Industrial and Automotive Repair or IAR and Engineered Fastening developed strong OM growth, up 22% and 18% respectively. For IAR, organic growth of 2% was a mixed bag across geographies. North America was solid 6% with strong performances from Mac Tools, industrial distribution, engineered storage and Advanced Industrial Solutions. Europe was off 3 points, primarily as a result of timing related to an ERP project. And emerging markets were up 1 point, the latter impacted by the same type of market issues as CDIY. Engineered Fastening was also up 2% organically with automotive up 9%, significantly outpacing global light vehicle production, which was up 2%. The industrial portion of Engineered Fastening was down 2%, with timing of sales to electronics OEMs weighing down a strong performance in industrial distribution. Infrastructure was up 5% organically with oil and gas up 4% and hydraulics up 9%. In total, it was an excellent quarter for the Industrial portfolio and we can expect continued momentum to carry into the second half. Moving to Security, this was a quarter in which the financials began to reflect the underlying progress which has been made in both North America and Europe over the last nine months or so. Revenues were flat with organic growth down 1 point, operating margin up 8% year-over-year recovering to 11.3% and up 80 basis points. North America and emerging markets was up 2% organically with Europe down 6%. North America and emerging markets OM was up 310 basis points versus a year ago, approaching very healthy historical norms at 16.5% of sales, benefiting from volume, better pricing, field efficiency and a tight SG&A framework. In North America, vertical market penetration continued to grow with a series of large exciting wins in retail, financial services and higher education. Europe was characterized by improved stability and predictability as many of the operational and organization fixes discussed over the last few quarters began to produce results. In that regard, Europe performed in accordance with expectations with OM still in the low single-digits, but improving sequentially by 240 basis points and setting the stage for continued improvement in the second half. Over the 14 country P&Ls in Europe, 12 are now considered stable or improving and only two, Spain and Italy, representing 10% of the European portfolio, are still facing significant structural and operational headwinds. On a very positive note, Europe attrition is tracking to a targeted range of 10% to 12%, with that 700 basis points favorable to last year. Our focus in Europe continues to be on tight operational management and cost reduction to drive margin expansion and ultimately organic growth. So while Security is still a work-in-progress, especially in Europe, we are quite confident that we are on the right track and the results will continue to improve as we go forward. With that, I will turn it over to Don Allan for some commentary on the financials.
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim. I'd like to spend a little time talking about our cash flow performance this morning. We're very pleased with our second quarter free cash flow of $376 million, as the earnings growth and lower one-time payments resulted in this excellent performance. And you can see as you look at the second quarter versus the prior year in the line other, there's a significant benefit and that's being driven by these lower one-time payments in a significant way. As we've begun to wind down these activities as discussed back in the late part of 2013 and begun to execute that throughout the early stages of 2014 and are very pleased with that result. Moving to the right side of the page, looking at our year-to-date performance, you can see that we still have a very significant working capital negative outflow. That was planned and expected. Our working capital turns are at 6.7 times, right in line with our expectations. We still have plans in place to achieve a goal of somewhere between 8.5 and 9 turns by the end of the year. And we feel very good about those plans and the ability to execute on them in the next six months. Another item of note is our CapEx. As you know, we have been very focused on controlling the level of CapEx, getting ourselves within a band of 2% to 2.5% of our revenue. And through the first six months of the year, we're at 2.15% of revenues. So very pleased with that as well. Looking at free cash flow in total through the first six months, a $166 million. If you look at the history of our company post-merger of Stanley and Black & Decker, the historical trend would say that roughly 24% to 25% of our free cash flow happened in the first half of the year. And just extrapolating that will give an indication that our goal of $675 million is very much achievable. The other thing to factor in those, we are very much focused on controlling CapEx, controlling the one-time payments, and we feel very comfortable with our plans related to working capital, which gives us the confidence that we have the ability to at least achieve $675 million cash flow for this year. Moving to guidance on the next page, I obviously touched on cash flow over the last few years, but let's spend a little bit more time on EPS. As John mentioned, we increased our guidance range for 2014 for EPS to $5.50 up to $5.60 from the previous range of $5.35 to $5.50. On a GAAP basis, the range is up the same amount of factor to $5.38 to $5.48. So the difference between GAAP and adjusted is roughly $0.12, which approximates to $25 million charges that we have anticipated since the beginning of the year. So no change there. What is driving this change in guidance? It's really three factors. The first is that we do expect our organic growth to be a bit lower as emerging markets are experiencing some volatility that Jim walked through in a fair amount of detail. Although things are looking better in the back half of the year, we do expect the full year to be slightly lower versus previous expectations. The outdoor season has been short and obviously that has an impact on the full year as well. So as a result, we believe our organic growth where we originally thought of approximately 4% will be somewhere between 3% and 4%. So a modest decline in organic growth versus prior expectations. More than offsetting this impact, however, is a much stronger performance in our Industrial business and a very strong performance across the entire company related to lower indirect cost as well as pricing benefits. As we continue to focus on really programming the company to be prepared for certain volatility in the topline, which is most likely will occur. And then the last factor that's changing is we will be lowering our tax rate to the bottom part of the range where we gave initial range earlier in the year of 21% to 22%. We expect that to be closer to 21%. However we do expect a little bit of share creep in those two items will neutralize themselves. Two other factors to note really to guidance, I mentioned this factor back in April that if you look at the company most-merger for the last three or four years, our earnings have been split from first half and second half approximately 45% and 55%. When you do the math, you'll see that the new guidance range indicates that that is consistent with these trends. And so we feel comfortable with that expectation as well. And then looking at the second half earning split versus the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we would expect 47% and 53% respectively, as we do some timing issues related to tax, which shows some positive benefits in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And then as we continue to accelerate these indirect cost benefits and pricing benefits, that will have a more positive impact in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And lastly, a little bit of flavor on the segments over to the right, you can see that our CDIY and Industrial segments continue to be consistent. We expect mid single-digit organic growth in both segments. Our margin rate year-over-year improvement as the operating margin rate continues to increase due to some volume leverage, cost actions. And those items are more than offsetting the negative FX that John walked through in a little detail earlier on. In Security, we expect a flat to modest decrease in organic revenue, consistent with prior expectations, and the margin rate to be relatively flat. So no major change with the outlook associated with Security. We feel like we've programmed the company to be prepared for a little bit of volatility associated with some of the economic and market conditions around the world by really focusing on indirect cost and certain pricing actions. And it positions us well to achieve our new guidance range. So to summarize the call this morning, 2014 continues to be focused on executing operating and capital allocation actions. We've delivered a very strong second quarter performance despite some significant weather issues, foreign currency pressures and emerging market volatility. We were able to demonstrate margin expansion across all our segments. We have very tight cost focus across the entire enterprise, which enabled significant operating leverage. We remain optimistic about Security European recovery and we feel like the second quarter was a very positive step forward. We remain focused on our 2014 near-term items, which is really to make sure that we're focused on the returns and relative performance of the company. And we're focused on organic growth initiatives, the continued Security margin improvement, surgical cost actions across the entire company to ensure we continue to achieve operating leverage, not losing sight of our working capital focus and achieving 8.5 to 9 working capital turns by the end of the year, and then of course making sure that we continue to stay on track with our capital allocation rebalance for 2014 and '15 with an acquisition moratorium and then the share repurchase and deleverage as we continue this year and into 2015. All these items, we believe, position us very well to make sure that we deliver our long-term financial objectives. With that, we'll move to Q&A.
Greg Waybright: Thank you. Paulette, we can now open the call to Q&A please.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse.
Mike Dahl - Credit Suisse: With respect to the margins, really impressive job on CDIY this quarter, hitting a new record. Was wondering you highlighted a bunch of things, but given that, the mix of geographies and products shifted a bit. Could you quantify how much that also may have helped and how you think about margins longer term in this segment, given how far you've come?
Jim Loree: I think one of the great misperceptions about CDIY business or any of our businesses is that as you go across the globe, we have radically different profitability structures. And while the gross margins and the SG&A can be somewhat different as you go from geography to geography, typically the operating margins are very consistent. So the mix of, for instance, the lower emerging markets did not have a dramatic positive impact on the operating margin. The extra-good performance in Europe vis-à-vis, say, the US with its outdoor issues did not have a significant impact on operating margins from a mix perspective. So really the geographic mix in general is not a big deal in terms of driving the margin rate. What really drove it was a series of things that Don and actually all three of us talked about, which is a really, really tight focus on margin management, starting with gross margins, productivity in the factories through the Stanley fulfillment system, pricing and new product introduction, driving competency in the organization in terms of price management. And then on the cost side in SG&A, as you know, we took several actions in last year that are now carrying over into this year as planned. But on top of that, we have a very sharp focus on indirect cost reduction across the company. We spend over $1 billion a year of cost in this indirect area, which would be the non-people related expenses. And every dollar that today is under a microscope as to whether it's really driving revenue, driving value and whether it can be reduced without hurting anything really to the company's overall growth and profitability. So that's what drove the margin improvement and not some kind of a mix impact.
John Lundgren: Let me add one point and it'll just even further amplify what Jim said, because you asked basically about geographic mix, and I think Jim described in quite accurate detail. They're consistent. He didn't talk specifically about product mix. Historically, hand tools and storage have been slightly higher profitability than power tools. This being said, the team has made great progress on power tool margins with some of its design and engineering efforts. And in this particular quarter, you'll note from Jim's deep dive on this segment, power tools was up 2%, while hand tools and storage was flat. So if anything, it's a negative product mix in the quarter, more than offset by the initiatives that Jim just talked about. So there're lot of good things going on within the four walls of our CDIY business. And I think Jim described them quite accurately.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays.
Stephen Kim - Barclays: I guess I wanted to follow up here on CDIY. I think you're looking for mid single-digit organic growth as we go forward. Obviously the broader context in things housing related has gotten softer of late, it sounds, both on the remodeling as well as on the new construction side. You called out outdoor, which makes a lot of sense due to the weather. But I was curious if you could provide a little bit more granularity around what your expectations are for things getting stronger. You just mentioned, I think, that hand tools and storage was flat in the quarter. Was kind of wondering whether you think any of that maybe reflects some of the softness I was referring to in the broader housing context, and what international or emerging markets expectations you've got embedded in that mid single-digit CDIY outlook.
John Lundgren: The North American POS was 6% in the quarter. It was up sequentially versus the first quarter. So we didn't see any softening in our POS in North America. And we, as we forecast POS on a go-forward basis, continue to see a strong performance in whatever market conditions we happen to be in right now, which don't appear to be slowing from our perspective. And that's partially because as you know we're not directly tied to the housing market. We're indirectly tied to the housing market. In Europe, we continue to see strong performance based on the product introductions that I referenced and the outlets that were increased. So we expect continued mid single-digits there. And in the emerging markets, we were 5% in the first half and we expect to be up at least that much in the back half and potentially more based on a tremendous, as I said in my comments, new product introduction in the mid price point product. That's not to be underestimated, and that is a significant initiative that's been in the works for about a year-and-a-half now, almost two years and the products are literally being sold as we speak. Whatever geopolitical situation that we have as we sit here today, that will drive our performance under those circumstances. So we're quite confident about the mid single-digits in CDIY in the back half.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie.
Mike Wood - Macquarie: In terms of the European Security business, is any of the resizing of the business there incremental based on the organic growth weakness in Southern Europe? And at this new resized level, can you talk about much longer-term where the structural margin range is for that European conversion Security business?
Don Allan: Obviously we talked to the European Security business in the sense of how much sequential improvement it made quarter-over-quarter, very pleased with that. We're not seeing incremental improvement yet versus the prior year. And our expectation is as we go through the remainder of the year and we get closer to the fourth quarter that at that point, we could see some year-over-year improvement in the business performance. Now that's really going to be dependent on a couple of factors. One, we are seeing some difficult performances, Jim mentioned, in Spain and Italy. When you exclude those two countries, you'll most likely see a healthy performance year-over-year in this business excluding those two countries. But those two countries right now are weighing down the business a little bit. Our expectation at this point is that we would expect some incremental improvement even with them by the end of the year, but that could be modest challenge for us. We've factored that into our guidance. So we're not overly concerned about this. But when we look at that business specifically, we do see that as a bit of a challenge. As far as long-term, we still continue to believe that it is a business that can be double-digit profitability over the next few years. And then eventually it can get to mid-teens levels along with the rest of our Security business. And the factor that's really going to drive that second stage evolution is going to be what we've been doing in North America over the last 18 months or so, which has been rolling out the vertical market solutions to key verticals such as retail, financial services, healthcare, et cetera, and bringing those to Europe, because we haven't done that at this stage, because we're kind of in a turnaround recovery mode of that business getting all the basics in place, the operating rhythms, the field organization structure the right way, et cetera, et cetera. And by the end of the year or early next year, we would begin to bring this vertical approach to the European marketplace. And as a result, that will help us move the profitability of the business closer to the mid-teens level over the long-term.
John Lundgren: Don reference Spain and Italy without too much cause and effect, but I think you're all quite familiar with what's going on, particularly in the Spanish market, which is a large market for us. Just three things to touch on, first of all, a very intense competitive environment which makes it a difficult market in the first place. Second, not news to anyone, commercial construction is nom-existent in Spain and has been for the last year-and-a-half. And thirdly, with the Niscaya acquisition, we were largely influenced by the financial services verticals, specifically banks. And it's probably not news to anyone that our bank branches in Spain are closing at a very, very, very rapid rate. So we are fishing in a much, much smaller pond in an intense competitive environment two years ago and that's creating some headwinds for that business that Don referenced to. But it's probably appropriate to give you just a little bit of the whys.
Don Allan: Yeah, but there's really no cause for major concern, because it's really less than 10% of our European portfolio and less than 5% of our total Security portfolio. But we're being very right in saying that we don't think we've solved the issue in Spain and Italy yet.
Jim Loree: And we factored it into our guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.
Mike Sang - Morgan Stanley: It's actually Mike Sang in for Nigel. Wanted to jump back on the MPP initiative. It sounds like it's going well and you alluded to it earlier, but against the backdrop of weaker emerging markets. I was wondering if that changed your view at all on how much you need to invest to build that business and how the calculus impacts the topline and margin contributions?
Jim Loree: So just to refresh everybody who may or may not have heard this in the past. But the MPP markets in tools across the emerging markets are about 60% to 70% of the total markets. And they are where the growth is the fastest, and they are where the local competitors are the most skilled at driving growth. So if you're going to play in tools on a serious global emerging market platform, you have to play in the MPP market and you have to do it with products that are at the price point and at the performance point that you are meeting or exceeding the local competition. So our strategy has been very much focused on exactly that. And it actually plays quite well into slowing markets, because slowing markets tend to have some economic distress. And when distress occurs, people move from higher-priced products to lower-priced products. So we expect the growth in the mid price point and we call it MPP+, which is mid price point plus or MPP or MPP-. And we have a next step with MPP to see a little degradation from MPP+ to MPP kind of a water fall down in terms of where the market goes. And I think we're extremely well positioned in that regard, and we made our investments. It's not like we have to make a lot of new investments. We put 300 feet in the street. We've designed the products. We bought GQ, the Chinese power tool company. We've upgraded the products very nicely with local Chinese leader in that market. And they also export beautifully into all our markets around the world. So we're in a pretty good place there. And I think in addition to that if the markets were accelerating, I suspect that the desire to invest amongst all the competitors would be even stronger. I think the likelihood of investments by competitors is still there. But perhaps the magnitude and speed at which they invest will be regularly sum up by the market expectations. So in kind of a perverse way, I think we're in a very good spot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.
Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo: What's the organic growth rate that's assumed in the 3% to 4% for the year in terms of the contribution from organic growth initiatives? And then second one, John, you talked about Spain and Italy being a pressure point within European Security. At one point, you start to look at that and say, do we really need to be there and is that structurally important to our overall Security business and it may make sense for us to just move away from those markets longer term.
John Lundgren: 2% organically in the first half, if we're going to be up 3% in the second half for the year, the math would say we have to be 4%. It's just math. 2% plus 4% divided by 2 is 3%. So it's 4% to 5% in the second half, if that's your question, versus 2%. And this is globally of course for the entire corporation all in. And obviously that's going to vary by segment. And the answer to your second question, that's a great question, we ask ourselves that question all the time. We look at all the alternatives and will continue to. I think what's important to note is before we abandoned something, we give it our best effort to fix it. And we've made some tremendous improvements there. We will continue to do that. But you are right on, we're not in a position on this call to talk about paths forward. But I think let's get realistic. Jim gave you a very important number. It's 10% of our European Security business, which means it's 5% of our global Security business, which means it's 1.25% of our company. We are looking at it. We're focusing on the alternatives. We're not going to move a lot of needles irrespective of what we do. But to the extent it continues to be a drag, you've followed us a long time, we have a history of if we can't fix something in 18 to 24 months, we used to do something else with it. And we don't follow more than anything that is in earnings cost to capital.
Jim Loree: The growth initiative impact for the year, and it's going to be about 1.5 point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Unidentified Analyst: It's actually (inaudible) for Mike. Part of the increase in the operating EPS guidance was due to better Industrial performance expectations. Within Industrial, was there a specific area that's driving this outlook, or is it kind of evenly spread across each of the individual groups?
Don Allan: Within our Industrial segment, the largest businesses are Industrial and Automotive Repair business, which are very large businesses in the US and Europe, our Engineered Fastening business which is performing extremely well, and then our smaller businesses within the Industrial segment as we report are oil and gas and hydraulics. Each and every one is up beautifully year-to-date, and we expect more good things. Jim talked about how well Engineered Fastening was performing. It's still 50% to 60% of that business is OEM auto and it's performing at a level four times the rate of the market. So we're obviously gaining share, well managed business, diversifying into other verticals. IAR is strong and we think will continue to be. IAR has a large percentage of its business in Europe, but it's performing quite well in Europe despite a relatively stagnant market. And oil and gas and hydraulics being much more volatile had really nice second quarter and we see those trends continuing. That's a very long way of saying there's strength across each and every business within our Industrial segment. And at the current point, there are no fixed uppers. There is just leverage, the great positive momentum that those business leaders have taken into the second half of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA.
Jeremie Capron - CLSA: Good progress on margins and I wanted to follow up on liquidities question on the Industrial segment where we've seen over 200 bps of margin expansion there. I'm wondering if you could give us more color on what's driving this margin expansion and what we should expect going forward as manufacturing activity seems to be expanding. Should we expect operating leverage to continue to play a large role there and to see margins trending up further?
Jim Loree: We clearly see that across the portfolio within Industrial for components of it, if you want to look at that, which is really three ones that we talk about externally, infrastructure, IAR and Engineered Fastening are contributing in a positive way for organic growth and continuing in a very positive way for operating leverage. And the reason they're contributing in such a significant way for operating leverage is all the things that all three of us have articulated in a fair amount of detail this morning, which is the focus on surgical pricing actions in our businesses. We're focused on indirect cost controls. We've also taken other SG&A cut actions that we embarked upon in the fourth quarter of last year. And we've been very focused on how we improve our operating leverage across our company. And I think you're seeing the most significant impact within our Industrial segment. But then again when you look at the rest of the company across at CDIY and even in Security, so it's just really representing the impact of all the things that we're trying to do to manage the business, manage the organic growth, manage the margin mix, manage the price, manage the cost and really enhance the operating performance of the business. And ultimately the true cash flow of the business in the company starts to come through. And you saw that in the second quarter with a very strong cash flow performance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc.
Ken Zener - KeyBanc: John, I wonder if you could do the math for me. On US Security margin split between CSS and mechanical and expand on you guys' comment on how the domestic field efficiencies are lifting the CSS business, because I know there have historically been some real spread there. Do you think that part is picking up as well as mechanical coming down?
John Lundgren: I won't do the specific math, because we don't necessarily want margin by sub-segment within a segment in the public domain. You know this business really well, but I think I can help you directionally. Ken, historically mechanical access security and access of that higher margin has been convergent, that is converging as electronic margins increase and we maintain or increase it at a faster rate than either access or MAS. Our MAS business is still a little soft, so it's representing a lower percentage of the total due to no other factor than what Jim has talked about on several of the calls, specifically the switch from a direct to a distribution model and the resulting margin impact of that, which over time we're highly confident will be offset by increased volume, by increased share, by operating leverage. But as we speak, consistently high margins, there's no huge spread across the three sub-segments within North American Security. And as Jim referenced to a previous call, the Asia-Pacific or emerging market piece that's baked into that same number, there's no dramatic difference there either. By healthcare business and emerging markets business, margins are a little lower than North America. And that's really all the detail on sub-segments that we care to get into.
Jim Loree: Ken, you've been with us a while. You remember, I'm sure, when the Security business in North America started having some issues about a little over a year ago, we discussed at the time one of the reasons for that was that we had made an organizational change where we had taken the structure that we had been running the CSS business on historically, which was a centralized structure in terms of metrics management and field deployment, and we had pushed that centralized structure out into that AD P&Ls in the various geographical regions of the United States and had placed accountability at that level for managing P&Ls and then rolled it all up into a total. And it turned out that that particular move was not a very smart one. And so when we started going backwards in the field about a year or so ago in terms of efficiency, we determined that one of the reasons was that we did not have the people in running these P&Ls that were really capable of managing the efficiencies and the labor loading and all the complexities that go with managing a field like that. So about nine months ago, we reversed that decision and we went back to the centralized model. And now what you're seeing is the benefits of a very, very metric-based daily intense management model, which is the way that you make money and manage your field effectively in electronic security business. And having made that mistake once, we will not make it again. I can promise you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Winnie Clark from UBS.
Winnie Clark - UBS: You talked about the headwind you saw in CDIY in North America in the second quarter as retail inventory replenishment came to a halt. Have you started to see that come back and is there a potential for the tail of the outdoor season to be a bit longer and strong due to the slower start that you saw? And then could you see some benefits from restocking in the second half?
Jim Loree: The outdoor season, it's so very specific to the first quarter and the second quarter that there's very little replenishment that goes on in the third quarter. And really what you've got now is retailers are just trying to make sure that they don't get stuck holding it back with a bunch of inventory. So there's really no chance for, I'd say, either really any significant upside or downside relative to outdoor.
John Lundgren: I think that's very well said. I mean to oversimplify what Jeff Ansell's team would say, you get to the middle of June, that season is over. They're already looking forward to fall products. So we're optimistic what's there. We'll sell through. But due to the late start, to Jim's point, it was the reorders that didn't take place. In their minds the season is over. That volume, there's probably no reason to think that volume in terms of shipments will come back. And we'll move it on from there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Can you break out the second half assumptions kind of embedded in that 4% to 5% organic across the major regions, I guess, just compared to the volume that you saw in the first half growth?
Don Allan: We don't really give it that way. But the reality is when you look at the trends that we've seen in our company in some of the commentary that Jim mentioned this morning, we've seen a very strong performance in certain pieces of our European business. Other pieces such as Security Europe have been a little weaker. Emerging markets had a solid performance in Q1 and then had some volatility in Q2, and we expect that to improve in the back half for all the reasons that Jim walked through around MPP. So I'm not going to give you specific numbers by regions. But what I can tell you is that from a trend perspective, things will move. I think Europe will be relatively consistent with a little bit of it tailing down as we start to comps and difficult comps in CDIY Europe. Emerging markets will ramp back up from what we saw in Q2 and get stronger. And then the US will be a little stronger than what we thought, because we were definitely impacted by outdoor in a negative way, and we don't expect that to repeat. So we would expect a modest improvement in that particular performance.
Jim Loree: To help you with your modeling, it's too much detail to get into on the call. We do included in the appendix in tremendous detail at least in terms of Europe performance and history. But just thinking at a high level, 50% of our global business is in the US or 53% is in North America, 25% in Europe and 25% in the rest of the world. Rest of the world is clearly going to grow faster than North America and Europe. And weighted average gets you to the 4% to 5% in the second half and 3% to 4% for the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Saliq Khan from Imperial Capital.
Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital: Security has been talked about previously as well but if you're looking at much of the drag on the overall revenue growth it's previously been the result of Security business, particularly as we're looking at Europe. Now Stanley has been criticized by the investment community for a lot of its challenges within that division, which has traditionally been a very high margin business. There have even been talks about the divestiture of the Security business from the rest of Stanley, I know someone mentioned that previously as well. Now we've been writing a lot about Security turnaround strategy for several months now and it's really nice to see that Security is finally seeing an uptick. With that being said, within the vertical market penetration, specifically in North America, which segments are you seeing the most traction in, and what is working within those segments that you can use to penetrate in other segments and also try to emulate that strategy in the European market as you look into the back half of 2014 and go into 2015, I know that a large number of the sales force within Security sector has previously been replaced by those people that are not just looking for new business, but also farming for existing businesses as well?
John Lundgren: Those two issues, which verticals are gaining traction in the US and is there learning that applies to other verticals, and then second that's I think will help the audience the most. Well, our order rates are running close to $100 million annualized on the verticals. And within that $100 million, I think the number one vertical would be retail. And we've been doing some work in integrating EAS systems with Security systems that seems to be very appealing to large retailers. And we've had one very large win and then a couple of smaller ones. And we see a couple on the horizon in retail, which is kind of a very unique value proposition that nobody else is providing at this point in time, which does a lot of data analytics for the headquarters and the regions of the retailers. So that's one exciting area. Another one is healthcare. And our healthcare activities are really divided into two pieces. The one is the traditional security business that covers acute care facilities and senior living facilities and just medical facilities in general. And that's your basic security systems. But we also have this other part of our business which we call it healthcare, but it's centered in patient security, but now it's evolved to an asset tracking a patient safety, a compliance productivity generating business that really ties together a lot of software solutions with hardware components and peripherals and brings the ability to kind of manage the hospital better or the senior living facility better to the hospital. And we're kind of combining that now in a go-to-market basis in selected areas with our core security business. And what we're finding is that the value proposition that we can bring to the C level type people in hospitals, for example, is very, very compelling. So we've had some wins already that are pretty significant there and we have some wins on the horizon that I think will eye-opening in size. And then another one is higher education. We've had several significant universities wins in the last six months or so. And these tend to vary from providing kind of campus control solutions to more traditional or more basic security solutions. But we have several technologies today that we are kind of weaving together as we go to these various verticals. And one of them is the RTLS technology that we gained through the AeroScout acquisition. And another is the EyeLock technology that we have exclusive rights to in these markets. And then we have done a really nice job I think also integrating with the PSIM systems, the basic security systems, so that we can kind of go to a customer and take what might be a hodge-podge of various security systems that they might have installed across their enterprise and sort of tie them together in a better way. So these are kind of all at the root of the success of the vertical initiative. And I think just to focus on becoming a subject matter expert in each one of these verticals and providing solutions to the customer. The ability to transfer this to Europe, I think we're getting very close to the point where we can begin to do that. That will not be an overnight sensation. It will take at least one to two years for it to really settle in and start driving the growth there. But it is very powerful. These solutions are transferrable. And there's not a whole lot of extra work that needs to be done to take them to Europe in terms of the product modifications. It's really more of preparing the European sales force to sell these and commercialize these. And that is something that we want to do, but we also want to make sure that the environment is stable and that the talent is there to be able to do that in Europe. And we're nearing the time when we can kind of make that happen, but it's going to be a quarter or two before we actually make that happen.
Operator: Our next question comes from Liam Burke from Janney Capital.
Liam Burke - Janney Capital: IAR had a good quarter with Mac Tools up, so the automotive vertical looked pretty strong for the quarter. Are there any other verticals that contributed or have shown unusual strength either in this quarter or as you see it going forward?
Jim Loree: Liam, I don't know if you jumped on the call late. I talked a little bit to a previous question on the Industrial segment. As you know, IAR and Engineered Fastening are the big businesses. And Engineered Fastening is about 50%, OEM auto the other 50% spread across aerospace, consumer electronics and other verticals. Then the rest of that segment, as you know well, is infrastructure or hydraulics and oil and gas businesses. All performed extremely well in the quarter. So we really had broad-based organic growth and operating leverage across the entire Industrial platform. It was a very encouraging quarter. And no one specific vertical or end-market to single out has been an extraordinary driver.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James: The inventories on a year-on-year basis are up pretty sharply. Now I don't think I should be too worried about it. You did mention, Don, that you are expecting working capital to improve by year-end and you did raise guidance. But where are those inventories on a year-on-year basis and was there any benefit to fixed cost absorption during the quarter?
Don Allan: As I mentioned back in the April call, I actually indicated that we would be mostly like building some inventory in the CDIY business in the second quarter to prepare for the remainder of the year to prepare for the MPP rollout in emerging markets. And as I indicated a few minutes ago, the working capital turns pretty much came in line with our expectations by the end of the quarter. So you're exactly right, the inventory levels are a little bit higher than maybe what we originally anticipated six months ago or so. But they're right in line with what we're anticipating as we began the second quarter. We feel good about how we're positioned for the remainder of the year. We have very robust plans, like we do every year, in place to address the inventory payables and receivable levels over the next six months and feel that the working capital numbers that I provided are very achievable. As far as absorption, yeah, obviously the impact was part of our guidance, part of what we planned. It was not very significant, but clearly it does an impact on the higher levels of inventory versus the prior period or the prior quarter, but didn't drive anything significant beyond our expectations. It was right in line with what we expected.
Operator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.
David MacGregor - Longbow Research: I guess the question from here is, which is kind of the other side of the equation, is how do we grow the business and what might be achievable in terms of just growing the RMR portfolio from here and if you could just talk about what sort of the most impactful levers are to you at this point.
Jim Loree: You're right on. I mean the first quarter of business was to keep what we have. And then in the process while we were doing that, we were also and have been now for almost two years building a sales force and a commercial engine for that business, because when we acquired it, we didn't have one. We had an organization that was reliant on its cousin, which was the Securitas Corporation. So I'd say that sales force rebuilding process has gone reasonably well in most geographies. And if set aside Spain and Italy, which if you look at the organic growth being down 6% in the second quarter, I think it was down 7% in the first quarter, what you have there is two things going on. One if the spill-over effect of the prior attrition from prior quarters having an impact. But equally as important the installation business is down. And it derives from Spain and Italy being about a third of the issue. And then beyond that, we have a very, very focused initiative to make sure that we're not taking on business that is low-margin business and low value-added business. So that has an impact. And then finally, it's just a matter of making sure that we have the requisite number of salespeople or feet on the street on the payroll. We need to deal with the Spain and Italy issues, as was talked about earlier. So that's part of it. And then I think the feet on the street issue, earlier in the year, we were down probably about 30 to 40 people versus what we needed to have or wanted to have in sales in Europe. And I think today, we're right around down 10. So we're making a lot of progress on that front, getting to where we need to be. And the order rates in the back half of the year need to kind of come up. They're negative right now, consistent with the organic growth numbers, and they need to come up. And so that is the focus right now. It's making sure that the feet on the street are performing. And all this is very tactical. But as you've seen when we address these tactical issues in sequence here, we've been relatively successful. So we're confident that we can get that done. And then of course, the medium to longer-term solution to this is to have this vertical market of products and the vertical market sales organization that was discussed a few minutes ago transferred over to Europe. So this is a staged execution project just like everything else we've been doing here. And right now, we're in the stage of making sure that the origination capability of the organization is not only there, but performing at a level that is acceptable. And then of course, the next step from there will be bringing in the vertical market solutions.
Operator: I will now turn the call over to Greg Waybright for closing comments.
Greg Waybright: Paulette, thank you. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation. And obviously please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-04-24 09:00:00) =====
Saliq Khan: Michael Dahl – Credit Suisse Mike Wood – Macquarie Research Wendy Clark – UBS Jeff Sprague – Vertical Research David MacGregor – Longbow Research Liam Burke – Janney Montgomery Scott
Operator: Welcome to the Q1 2014 Stanley Black & Decker Incorporated earnings conference call. My name is Dawn, I will be the operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.
Greg Waybright: Thank you, Dawn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's first quarter 2014 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO, Jim Loree, our President and COO, Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO, and Jeff Ansell, our Senior Vice President and Group Executive Construction and DIY. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well is on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim, Don and Jeff will review Stanley's first quarter 2014 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A section. Because of the size of the queue, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such, may involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release in our in most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John Lundgren: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. As Greg mentioned, this morning, in addition to Don Allan and Jim Loree, we have Jeff Ansell, an additional colleague with us this morning. And as most of you know, Jeff runs our CDIY business. I will stay at a high level in my introductory comments and let Jeff dive a little deeper into CDIY, an outstanding quarter in CDIY, and Jim will give you a lot more granularity on both the industrial and the security segments before we open it up to Q&A. Revenues up 7%, 4% of that was organic, and Infastech accounted for the majority of the difference between organic growth and total sales. Our internal growth investments, Project Leapfrog, contributed almost 200 basis points to our growth in the first quarter. That program is really gaining some traction. Margins expanded 30 basis points to 12.1%. We had a lot of focus on cost because during the quarter, we absorbed about $25 million of negative currency pressure. But the fact that we did a really good job controlling costs in general and indirect costs in particular, we achieved some volume leverage. And as Don explained on our January call, of that $25 million, about one-third is translational and two-thirds is transactional. EPS was $1.07, $1.05 on a GAAP basis, and I think what will be good news to many of you, you'll see the convergence between GAAP and adjusted earnings as there were minimal special charges recorded in the first quarter, and it will be the same for the rest of this year. CDIY industrial both posted compelling top and bottom line results. Jeff is going to give you more on CDIY, so I will just note that organic growth was 6% and every geographic region on the globe expanded. Industrial delivered 5% organic growth and 15.6% margins. That's a 170 basis point improvement versus first quarter 2013. Looking at security, it is tracking to plan aside from the weather impact in North America, and security Europe is gaining some traction. It's not yet manifested in the financial performance. As suggested, Jim is going to give you a lot more detail where we are, where we are going with this business. We've got a lot going on, and in we think it's on the right track. But as a consequence, we're increasing the low-end of our guidance in 2014, and we are going to reiterate our cash flow performance. We are saying – taking the low-end up to $5.35 to $5.50. There's been a lot of volatility, a lot of uncertainty there that Don will talk about, and we are reaffirming $675 million in free cash flow. That's including the $250 million from a cash perspective of one-time payments. So, solid top and bottom line performance led by our CDIY and industrial tools businesses. Looking very quickly at the sources of growth, the top line momentum continues and as I suggested, our organic growth investments are starting to gain traction. Volume was up 4%. Price was flat, leading to organic growth of 4% for the quarter. Acquisitions accounted for another 4%, and currency was a 1% headwind for a total of 7%. On the acquisition front, we get more on the segments, but if you look at organic growth, the majority of our businesses grew 5% to 6% organically, and security, which represents about 20% of the business, was flat to slightly down. Jim will give you some more granularity. On acquisitions, that's primarily Infastech, which closed in February 2013. That's going really well, adding a tremendous value, both strategically and economically, to our engineering fastening business. But that will anniversary in the first quarter and will become core going forward. Very quickly at the regions, you've got more granularity in the appendix. The US was up 2%. Strong organic growth in most businesses. We did have some weather impact that affected parts of our security business, and to a lesser extent, CDIY and industrial. Europe a strong 4% with a tremendous performance in CDIY across the European region. The emerging markets were up 5%, with Asia somewhat stronger than Latin America as we continue to face both the economic, political and currency headwinds in Latin America. Finally, the rest of the world, while it's a small percentage of the business, was up 8%. There's a lot going on there. Japan, which only counts for 2% of our business, was stated, probably with some orders pull forward. There's a consumption tax that went into effect in Japan on April 1, so there's probably a little bit of order pull forward there. Canada, which accounts for about 5% of our business, was up 9%. So, good, strong performance in the rest of the world, as well as the emerging markets. Let me turn it over to Jeff Ansell, who is going to dive a little deeper into the terrific first quarter performance that his business does.
Jeff Ansell: Thank you, John. Turning to page 6, we will begin with revenues that, you can see the chart depicts revenues increased 6%, or $65 million during the quarter. The three elements of that growth story that give us confidence in the CDIY business going forward are as follows. It marks – in terms of duration, it marks the fourth consecutive quarter of mid single-digit growth in the business. In terms of pervasive new product development, we had growth in every strategic business unit as innovation led the increased demand from end users. And then finally, the third element of growth was around customer connectivity and market activation that led to pervasive growth across customers, channels and geographies as depicted below with Europe at plus 11%, North America plus 5% and emerging markets plus 7%. So, we had growth in both the largest and emerging markets, driven by new product development, and consecutive sequential growth across four quarters. We feel quite good about the growth story. We did have profit expansion during the quarter as volume gains and intensive cost management offset severe currency pressure of approximately $20 million in the quarter. In total, to sum up page 6, growth of 6% organically with all regions and strategic business units delivering that growth, combined with profitability and cost focus that enabled an offset of sizable currency headwinds that masked very solid operating leverage in the quarter. Turning to page 7 to give you greater depth surrounding the sources of growth that enabled market share gain globally. We will start in the upper left portion of the chart in Europe. In the quarter, we had a great deal of success as it relates to innovation. Innovation drove growth in every strategic business unit across Europe. With this new product development tailwind, we were able to expand our retail partnerships to drive mutually beneficial growth for our growth, deliver growth for our customers and vice versa. Not only did we deliver growth in Europe, but we delivered growth in every European market as well as every European country in the quarter. This marks, as the chart shows, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in Europe. And while we expect positive growth in each of the quarters going forward in Europe, there will be pressure based on the comps that you see from that chart. We will expect positive growth in each of the quarters going forward, albeit potentially a lower growth percentage with that comp pressure. Turning to the upper right quadrant of the chart, our Built in the USA initiative that launched in November of 2013, this initiative leverages our unique and pervasive US manufacturing footprint that we are convinced is a competitive advantage. It is over 300 products in totality across various SBUs, and it focuses on a variety of brands including DeWalt, Stanley, Porter Cable and Bostitch. Our Built in the USA growth rates were accretive to the accelerated growth rates you saw on the previous page, meaning that it's delivering growth even beyond the core business. We'll probably give you the most confidence in the pictures that you see just below the words, retail registration in the boxes, industrial construction channel, as well as even trade unions. This initiative has gotten great support in inertia. Moving to the bottom left quadrant of the chart in the emerging markets, where we've added 300 plus feet on the Street in terms of commercial resource. Over 1,500 distributors now selling our product across the emerging markets. We've set up dedicated emerging markets power tool and hand tool strategic business units. We have mid price point product developments that was accelerated by our strategic GQ power tool acquisition. And perhaps the best way to depict what's going on in the emerging markets would be this. In over less than a 24 month period, we've gone from concept from the people in this room to global – to a structure, to a global supply chain with over 1,000 new products flowing through it to end users in markets all over the globe. I believe it's some of our best work to date. And then finally, bottom right quadrant of the chart depicts new product development across the strategic business units. Two things to note. First rule of businesses is, keep what belongs to you or what you have. Second rule of businesses is, if you want to be a growth company, take what belongs to someone else, and I think this chart depicts appropriately both of those things. If you look at the advances we've made in core products like going from brush to brushless cordless drills or auto locking tape rules, those things have held our core business in place and grown that core where we've also now expanded in terms of innovation into new products like cordless nailing and cordless grease gun, et cetera. Products that are highly incremental because they expand markets that we serve. The combination of all those things led to what we thought was a very positive growth performance inside the quarter. Turn it over to Jim.
Jim Loree: Thank you, Jeff. That is an impressive performance, considering the $20 million, or 170 basis points of FX headwind operating margin rate. With Europe up 11% organically, it's quite a statement about the momentum of the business. As you can appreciate from the CDIY story, the Stanley Black and Decker merger which created the world's largest tool company with its array of powerful brands, its strength in power and hand tools, its global scale and its robust, organic growth culture has created strategic benefits which go beyond the $500 million plus cost synergies and the $300 million plus revenue synergies already realized. What we have created and what Jeff and his team have managed very well, is a strategically advantaged franchise which has the capability to continue to expand margins while growing at healthy organic rates and gaining share. Now, moving to industrial. First quarter was another standout quarter for industrial with all three of the major businesses clicking on all cylinders and performing at a high level. Industrial OM was up $30 million, or 29% on 16% revenue growth with 170 basis points of operating margin rate expansion to 15.6%. Infastech contributed $14 million of the $30 million OM increase, and the remaining $16 million was organic and operational. What makes this performance even more compelling was that the operating leverage was delivered in the face of an approximate 70 basis point currency headwinds to the OM rate. Total industrial organic growth was 5%, acquisitions, in this case Infastech added 12 points and currency was a 1 point offset to sales. Industrial and automotive repair, or IAR, was up 5% organically, while engineered fastening and infrastructure each delivered 6% organic growth. This healthy growth facilitated the operating leverage which was complemented by strong productivity and tight cost controls. Now, turning to IAR specifically. Organic growth was achieved across the globe with Europe and North America both up 6% and emerging markets up 7%. IAR's results were boosted by the company-wide growth initiative, in this case, smart tools and storage and emerging markets. Mac Tools, Proto and Facom all turned in strong performances. Engineered fastening's organic growth was driven by legacy [Emhart] automotive business, which was up 11%. Outpacing global light vehicle production by a factor of 1.6 X, reflecting continued execution of their business model which involves development of new applications, recurring revenue, and increased per vehicle penetration. In addition, the Infastech integration is going very well, with all key results on track including sales, synergies and operating margin. Within infrastructure, oil and gas delivered 11% organic growth on top of a 9% growth comp the year ago. As both onshore and offshore continue to perform well in the market and the market continued to be robust. I do remind you, however, that oil and gas faces very challenging organic growth comps for the remainder of the year as the remaining quarterly comps range between 32% and 43% organic growth. At the same time, onshore pipeline project activity is facing a lull in this period as pipeliners gear up for what is expected to be a record 2015. In summary, we were very pleased with the performance in industrial during the quarter, and we continue to be bullish on this segment in total for the remainder of the year. And now we move on to security. This segment, which continues to be a work in progress, experienced a 3% revenue decline in the quarter with the 4% organic decline. Segment OM decreased $12 million to $52 million and the OM rate decreased 170 basis points to 9.1%. Once again, it was a markedly different story in North America versus that in Europe. North America, along with our small emerging markets unit, were down 1% organically taken together, and we believe US weather conditions exerted a modest downward pressure on that number. Encouragingly, the OM rate improved 40 basis points to 14.7%, and absolute OM dollars were essentially flat with 1Q 2013. Note that this is the first quarter since 4Q 2012 that both America and emerging markets OM quarter over quarter did not decreased significantly. We see this as an inflection point and expect the reversion to positive OM dollar accretion to begin in second quarter and continue as the year progresses. Importantly, we also expect this group to contribute positively to the Company's organic growth in 2014, especially in the second half. As the vertical market initiative is bearing fruit with the annualized order rate now running at $120 million, up from almost zero a year ago with the successes mounting, especially in retail and healthcare. So, stay tuned for more gains as we continue on through the year. The story as it relates to Europe security is one of significant progress under the covers, which has not yet manifested itself in the P&L. I will touch upon the specifics in a moment, but first, here are the numbers for 1Q. Organic sales were down 7% and OM was 1% versus 5.9% a year ago, representing a $12 million unfavorable OM headwind, which was steeper than expected. With that said, RMR attrition rate improved dramatically versus a year ago with a 340 basis points decrease, and this is a direct result of the intensive efforts we have made to implement basic attrition reduction processes in the various countries. In addition, order rates continued on a positive trend with a 5% increase in the quarter on the heels of an 11% increase in 4Q. And clearly, the issue in the quarter was mobilizing the field to efficiently install the growing backlog. This is the same issue that we successfully addressed in North America in the back half of last year, and we are well into the process of implementing very similar fixes now in Europe. In fact, the turnaround efforts for electronic security on both continents have followed or are following a very similar pattern. It starts with leadership upgrades, which in Europe have been extensive, but basically complete by last December. There has also been significant progress in creating a sales force in Europe comprised of hunters as opposed to individuals taking referrals from Securitas, their commercial partner in the pre-Stanley ownership era. The construction of the new sales force has been ongoing for about 18 months now and is well along, as you can see from the order rates. The next step is to stem the RMR attrition down from 18% zone to closer to 10% to 12%. This is also well underway, as I referenced, and we were able to see the results in the year-over-year improvements. We expect this initiative, which consists of both procedures which respond to customers requesting termination, as well as proactive processes involving customer care and contact throughout their lifecycle. That also involves emphasizing RMR origination and growth through tweaking the go-to-market approach in areas such as sales force focus, sales incentive plans and marketing and sales communication. Now, step four, which has been the most intensive focus area over the last 90 days, involves optimizing field operations, which means maximizing installation and service revenue, while doing it with the most efficient mix of labor, material and overhead content. The European team has made great strides during this period in producing key weekly metrics which enable vastly improved visibility to branch level activities, thus enabling management at various levels to hold the field organization accountable and monitor performance sufficiently to serve as both a management tool and a forecasting tool. So, in summary, we have an informed perspective on where we are the turnaround process in Europe, and we are managing it as closely and aggressively as possible. While it is slower than we would like, we have a high level of confidence that we are moving the needle and that the results will be evident in the P&L in coming quarters. What we now expect for Europe security for the second quarter is a significant improvement in the $12 million year-over-year OM decrease experienced in 1Q. We then expect Europe to shift to a positive contribution in either 3Q or 4Q. This trajectory would have total segment OM dollars flatish to nominally down in second quarter and then rebounding to OM dollar accretive in the second half. To simplify the guidance for the Company and adopt a prudent and conservative stance, we have zeroed out any increase in OM dollar contribution for security during the second half. This should be viewed simply as a timing hedge and not as a lack of confidence or conviction that a turnaround is underway. Don Allan will add more color on the guidance in just a few moments, and with that, I will now turn it over to him.
Don Allan: Thank you, Jim. Before I jump to guidance, I'd like to spend a little time and talk about our first quarter free cash flow performance. The free cash flow was consistent relatively with prior year, and we believe we are on track to deliver our $675 million of free cash flow, which is, as John mentioned, inclusive of $250 million of one-time payments that are primarily related to restructuring charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2013. So, a few items of note as we look at the free cash flow statement. First of all, our net income. You can see net income is up significantly year-over-year, and that's really where you see the impact of that convergence of GAAP versus adjusted EPS. In the first quarter of 2013, we had one-time special charges of $81 million after tax, and here in the first quarter of 2014, that number was about $2.5 million. A significant decline in the charges to our P&L, as expected, and that convergence has begun and is moving in a very positive direction as we head through the rest of the year. Working capital was a little bit worse than it was in the prior year, as you can see, as our working capital turns. From the seasonality perspective, always goes backwards from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. If you look at 2013, our working capital turns at the end of 2012 were about 7.5, and they went to 5.8 turns by the end of the first quarter of 2013. This quarter we had a similar phenomenon, but a little bit more significant as we built some inventory in our CDIY business to make sure that we are adequately prepared for some Q2 and Q3 demands for our specific customers in certain regions. As a result, our working capital turns at the end of 2013 were 8.0 turns and at the end of the first quarter this year at 5.9. So, a little more significant of a retraction in that sequential momentum, as I discussed, primarily due to the seasonality for the CDIY business. But we still believe that we will exceed 8 working capital turns by the end of this year, and we are on track with our plans to make sure that occurs. The other line has an unusual item in the last year, actually, in 2013 where we had a settlement or an outflow related to the sale of HHI that affected the cash flow statement which is one-time in nature that obviously didn't repeat again here in 2014. So, you see a $45 million benefit when you compare the two numbers year-over-year. Then a positive as well in CapEx, whereas many of you know we made some significant investments in 2013 related to corporate growth initiatives but also related to certain integrations of acquisitions, and our CapEx levels were at a higher rate as a percentage of revenue. In 2013, that was 3.1% of revenue, and for a full year in 2013, it was 3.5%. This year in the first quarter, it was 2.2%, right in line with our expectation and our full-year estimate of 2.5%. So, we are very pleased at the level of CapEx that we experienced here in the first quarter. Overall, on track with our expectations. Let's move to guidance. As John mentioned, we are increasing the low end of our EPS range. Previous guidance was $5.30 up to $5.50. Is now $5.35 to $5.50, and we are also, as I just mentioned, reiterating our free cash flow guidance. On a GAAP basis for EPS, we still have $25 million of expected one-time charges that will rate to ongoing acquisition integration that will occur this year. So, no change in that particular area. What is the change in guidance? There's really two things that are driving it. The first is what Jim just mentioned about security margin and the expectation for dollars and rate. We now expect it to be relatively flat versus the prior year on a full-year basis versus the expectation of 150 basis point improvement we discussed in January. And Jim walked through it in a fair amount of detail what the drivers of that particular item are. On the positive side, or what we would like to call a tailwind going related to some of our other businesses, more than offsetting the security situation, is a stronger performance in our industrial business is now expected, both on a volume basis and a profitability basis for the remainder of the year. And then we've also seen through many of the efforts around reducing our indirect cost across the Company, we saw significant benefit in the first quarter, and we would expect that trend to continue in various areas across the Company through the remainder of the year. That is more than offsetting the negative impact of adjusting the security margins, as I just discussed, and as a result, we are increasing the low end of our guidance range. A few other items just to mention around guidance, as we look at the remainder of the year, just the staging of the quarters, over the last two years, 2012 and 2013, the first half is represented at approximately 45% of the full-year earnings, and we believe 2014 will be very similar. So, our first half of 2014 will approximate that 45%. Another item to note is that in the second quarter, we had a significant organic growth performance last year, which will result in a little bit of pressure on the comp and therefore, our organic growth will be slightly lower in the second quarter versus our full-year expectations of 4%. Moving to the segments on the right side of the page, CDIY is relatively consistent with our January expectation. They had a solid performance in Q1, as you heard from Jeff. And we would expect the trends to continue as we go through the remainder of the year, mid single-digit organic growth rate and revenue and then the margin rate showing an increase year-over-year as expected. The industrial business is going to be stronger, as I indicated. We expect now the organic revenue growth to be a little bit stronger than previously indicated back in January, and then the operating margin rate will expand a little bit more versus previous expectations as well. We've seen a really nice impact to the volume leverage as we've grown the business on the top line flowing through to the operating margin, as well as some really strong efforts around indirect cost reductions, as well as other people reductions that were in place in January of 2014. This is more than offsetting any pressure that we are seeing FX in the industrial segment. And then security, Jim walked through in a fair amount of detail what the staging would be for the remainder of the year. But when you look at the organic revenue for the whole segment for the full year, we actually expect it to be either flat to a modest decrease, which is slightly lower than expectation back in January. Then I walked through the margin rate expectation a few minutes ago of a relatively flat performance. Again, we do believe that we will see improvement in the second quarter versus the first quarter on a year-over-year comparison of operating margin. And then as we get into the back half of the year, we will begin to see some incremental OM growth in the security segment. With that, I'd like to summarize the presentation portion of the call this morning. We delivered a very strong first quarter performance despite some North American weather issues and a very significant foreign exchange headwind, as you heard from us this morning. CDIY industrial delivered excellent results. Tight cost control focuses across our entire Company and embedded within our organization and allowed us to have some modest operating leverage here in the first quarter, even given $25 million of FX headwinds. We remain very optimistic about our security recovery. However, Europe will be a little slower than expected, as Jim mentioned. We are very focused on our ability to continue to improve this business and move it forward and begin to see year-over-year profitability improvement in the back half of 2014. As mentioned before, the focus for 2014 is to improve our near-term returns and our relative performance, and we believe we are doing many things to ensure that that happens. We're focused on our organic growth initiatives, which we saw the positive impact of that in the first quarter of about 2 points and our total organic growth of 4%. Our full-year expectation for organic growth is approximately 4% as well with the organic growth initiative contributing about half of that. The security margin improvement is obviously a big focus, and Jim walked through a fair amount of detail on what we are trying to achieve in that particular area. We've been focused on surgical cost reductions to ensure our operating leverage, and you can see that starting to emerge here in the first quarter. And obviously, that strong focus above and beyond the headcount actions we took on indirect cost is really helping us achieve those objectives. Working capital continues to be an area that we would drive improvement year-over-year. We do see the effects of the seasonality here in the first quarter. But again, we expect our working capital turns to be in excess of 8 by the end of the year. And then certainly last but not least, our focus on capital allocation was rebalanced, as we mentioned back at the end of 2013. We are continuing our acquisition moratorium. We are prepared to do share repurchase when certain cash flows are available to do that and at the same time, we are deleveraging a little bit here in 2014. We believe that 2014 is very much focused on executing both our operating and capital allocation actions I just mentioned, but at the same time, it's positioning our Company to deliver on our long-term financial objectives. With that, we will move to Q&A.
Greg Waybright: Thanks, Don. Dawn, we can now open the call to Q&A, please.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) We have Nigel Cole online for Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Nice quarter, guys. I've got two questions. Firstly to Jim, you mentioned – you highlighted the backlog trends in Europe, which are obviously very encouraging and then some of the challenges of converting that backlog, given the field office situation. Can you maybe talk about some of the challenges of converting that backlog and secondly, can you talk about the pricing that you are seeing and maybe the tight margins in that backlog? Thanks.
Jeff Ansell: Sure. Let me take the – we will call that a question and I have, or a subquestion, so we can answer both. But we are pretty confident in the profitability of the backlog, to your second question, because we have good visibility now into it. We know what the margin rates are in the backlog. That's something we couldn't have told you six months ago. There's been a lot of progress in that regard. Now, there's still the issue of executing in accordance with what you think the margins are in the backlog, and we are getting a lot closer on that. I would say year ago we were probably averaging 4 to 5 points off, and we're much closer, within 2 points at this point in time, and we're continuing to converge that to try to be exactly on where we think we should be as it relates to what the margin log is in the backlog. That goes to the primary question, which is some of the challenges that we face with respect to converting the backlog and how we're dealing with them. So, the way to think about this is that if we go back even just six months ago, what we had was 14 countries with about, roughly 70 regions within the countries and then a whole host of branches under them. Each one run autonomously with disparate information systems and really, no significant management process that was inherited with the Niscaya acquisition. Even as – so when questions were asked of management in the countries, or even in their regions, about what the state of the backlog was or how installations were going and what the efficiency was of what they were doing, there really was no accurate information. It was all hearsay and that type of thing. It was very loosey-goosey, and therefore lies some of the issue with respect to forecasting this business, historically. What we've done is in the last 90 days to 120 days, we have implemented a very, very rigorous set of metrics at the branch level that are now produced on a weekly basis, and we have set very specific targets for these metrics, and we expect the branch folks to deliver them. These metrics can then be rolled up at the region level within the country, the country level and the total Europe level so we can see exactly what's going on with respect to things like labor efficiency, like net realized margins, which is what I was talking about in the beginning, and attachment rate for RMR, and so on. It is a dramatic change in the efficacy of what we're trying to do here, and its very similar to what we did in the North American business in the second half. The challenge now lies in, not so much in getting the information in putting the management process in, it now lies in making sure that the people that are actually held accountable are able to execute, and that's where the level of uncertainty lies now. It is not necessarily in the profitability level in the backlog, because I think we have good visibility to that. It is much more in, okay, we've got hundreds of people in these branches that are expected to perform at a certain level, and are they really going to perform at that level, and how many of them are we going to have to replace? We could be far more specific about exactly what was going to happen in Europe with respect to margins if we knew that we had the right people in place in the branches. But this is the last shoe that we need to deal with, and I suspect there will be some attrition and so forth as we go through this process, but we are already making much more headway with respect to visibility, with respect to just the metrics in general and our ability to forecast the business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Richard Kwas: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I will have two questions, I'll make them brief. On security, I know – I realize the approach here with derisking the full year in terms of margin expansion. But when we think about the next 12 to 18 months, should be see – is the simply a push out? Or do you see potential greater magnitude of margin improvement in 2015 versus 2014, given the delay in the margin improvement this year? And then second question, Don, are these costs, in terms of you being surgical and being watching costs carefully, does any of that come back into the business later this year in 2015? Thanks.
Don Allan: On your first question, I think when we look at the security business, we still see long term, as a business, that can be mid teens profitability. We've communicated that before. The reality is that we do see a shift related to the European business by a quarter or two, as far as timing. Jim touched on it, it was more a timing issue. I wouldn't necessarily expect that there would be a dramatic pop in profitability in 2015. I would expect that we continue to see sequential improvement and growth year over year in profitability in 2015. But I do believe, as Jim mentioned, there's a lot of things that we continue to be focused on in our European business, and these things will take time to continue to address. But overall, the profitability will continue to improve. But I would expect it to be more a gradual, linear type of improvement over the next two years. On the indirect costs, when I look at that, that is really an effort of focusing on two things. One, volume of – or usage, if you want to call it, it the sense of how often do people travel, when do they travel, are they being efficient about it, use of office supplies, et cetera. All these different things that are tied to professional individuals in the Company, that we've actually asked people to be more focused on the use of them and be more efficient and effective. And at the same time there's the pricing aspect of really driving more pricing benefit based on our contracts with certain vendors. Due to that, I actually believe these are permanent changes that will stay in our P&L and they will not be something that pops back and affects us at some either later quarter or later year. We're trying to attack this in a way that is driving permanent change and therefore, driving operating leverage and we are starting to see in our P&L.
John Lundgren: Rich, let me just – this is John. Let me just follow up. We won't waste your spend time with some of the anecdotes. But to support what Don's saying, I think it is important to understand these are indirect costs. They're the kinds of things that John is talking about. These are the same conversations we've had with our board as every good board should ask. It's great that you are reducing indirect cost without having restructuring charges. What are we giving up? What aren't we doing? I think it's really important to note the reductions aren't coming as we break SG&A and other indirect costs into seven buckets. They aren't coming into the two or three buckets that have a long-term impact on the business, specifically. We are not cutting R&D, we are not cutting product development, we are not cutting our brand building activities. We are being very careful to ensure that we get the ROI on any of those activities before we add to them. But these are all, quite frankly, in the administrative areas and areas, the cost of doing business that we all recognize, but we think Don and his team and the folks leading this project have done a really good job in differentiating what has an impact on the business on our brands versus what is spending, quote, cost of doing business that we could be doing business at a lower cost.
Don Allan: Said another way, we're going after waste, and examples would be like, for instance, these air cards that we have – we use for hot spots, for Wi-Fi hot spots, historically. Well, you don't really need an air card anymore, because we have iPhones, and if you desperately need to get onto the Wi-Fi, you can use that. So, we have hundreds of air cards that we canceled, and we've canceled a lot of data services in areas where we – where people had access to Wi-Fi. No need for that. As we go through each element of spending, there are just enormous opportunities to slash waste out of the system without affecting the ability of the individual to perform, and that's really the focus of this effort.
John Lundgren: Which is really a natural evolution when you have a large merger such as we had with Stanley and Black & Decker and a few other large acquisitions on top of that. You put organizations together, people together, that settles down, they begin to work together. And then you focus on all the different types of costs that we are right now, which is really enforcing policy, changing policy and driving price.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.
Will Wong: Hi, thanks. It's actually Will Wong on for Mike. Regarding emerging markets, you guys had about a 5% growth there this quarter. Just wondering how it stacked up relative to your expectations? And just more broadly, relative to the organic growth initiatives, emerging markets being the biggest driver of that [$50 million] of revenue growth the next couple of years. Just wondering, of those five pieces, how each is progressing to date and also relative to your expectations?
John Lundgren: Yes, this is John. I will take it. You may or may not have been on the call during the source of growth discussion, and Jim can provide a little more granularity. We are about on track for emerging markets. Our growth is flat relative to the fourth quarter. But there are, as you'd suggested, a tremendous amount of moving pieces. 85%, or 80% of our emerging market volume is either in Latin America or Asia. Latin America, we continue to the face political, socioeconomic and currency headwinds, and it varies dramatically by country. Tremendous currency headwinds in Brazil, inability to ship in Venezuela and Argentina for different reasons. And as a consequence, Latin America grew low single-digits. That was below our expectations, but we absolutely believe, due to circumstances well beyond our control, on the other side, Asia continued to do well. We tempered our expectations for Asia, as China is an example, the GDP in the 7% range versus low double-digits as it's been in the past. But we kept up or exceeded market growth in those particular areas. A tremendous amount of the organic growth initiative to which you referred is taking place in emerging markets, as Jeff pointed out in his presentation. We've got about 300 additional feet on the street, salespeople, commercial people, focusing on those markets. And we think that's a great investment in that those people are not as expensive as a salesperson in Europe or in the US, yet the revenue that each of them generates has the ability to be as great. So, we think of that as very high return on our business. All-in, a tremendous – a lot of moving pieces within emerging markets, but in general, at the end of the day, consistent with our expectations, given the tremendous headwinds we faced. And I just – Jim will do it if I didn't, give a shout out to our emerging markets team. If you think about the currency headwinds they faced, the political issues they faced in Argentina and Venezuela, as well as just softening markets in Asia or less robust markets, I should say, they did a terrific job delivering on their commitments to us and our commitments to the external world. This is a very experienced, capable team with highly capable, local executives in each and every market coordinating really well between our industrial and our CDIY businesses to ensure that we are getting our products to the markets, to the end users, to the customers, irrespective of the channel of distribution, which is much more grey, much less black-and-white than it is and developed markets. So, all-in, a long answer to a simple question, but there are a lot of moving pieces, and we are quite pleased with how well that team performed.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Saliq Khan from Imperial Capital. Please, go ahead.
Saliq Khan: Hi. Good morning. I'm speaking on behalf of Jeff Kessler. I had a two-part question for you. The first one is from a RMR standpoint. What type of trends are you seeing from North America? And from a broader perspective, as we look at the dichotomy between the types of success that you're seeing in North America versus Europe, versus the rest of the world, do you see a shift in the focus on the regional level breakdown from a long-term perspective?
Jim Loree: Sure. Yes, we will see a shift, because I would say we are far more capable in North America of delivering what I will call monitoring RMR versus service RMR, which has a higher gross margin and therefore, a higher operating margin. We – as it relates to the portfolios, we had a slight increase in North America during the quarter. We had just a very, very slight decrease in Europe. It was actually very encouraging to see the stability of the RMR portfolio in Europe in the first quarter. But the RMR portfolio in Europe tends to be more service-based than it is monitoring. The challenge for us strategically here, because we do have the monitoring capacity in Europe, is to drive RMR monitoring sales increases. I alluded to in my comments, a few things that we are doing to be more proactive about driving RMR sales in Europe by changing the comp plans, which has been done, by focusing the sales force more on that, by focusing on RMR attachment in our metrics when we look at the sales and orders. All that stuff over the long term will help us shift the mix from the service RMR, which is good. It's better than installation, but it's far from the profitability level of the monitoring RMR.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead.
Michael Dahl: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the CDIY business, particularly, with Jeff here today. First on the PPT growth was pretty impressive and well in excess of the other SBUs. Can you talk specifically what you think was driving that? Was it outsized product launches in DeWalt or anything there? Then, just second, a quick clarification on the inventory comment. It sounds like that was unintentional build, and so just wondering if that was related to a specific promotion or product launch?
Jeff Ansell: Yes. Michael, this is Jeff. To respond to the question, the PPT growth led all four of the SBUs for the fourth consecutive quarter. We continue to grow that business concurrent with the rest of the business but at accretive levels. And really, the driving force behind that is two things. Protecting the core business with things like innovations within brushless, cordless, et cetera. Things that are driving higher average tickets within our core and then augmenting that with the expansion products that fall into adjacencies that are predominantly incremental. Things like cordless nailing, cordless grease guns, heated jackets, things that we hadn't done historically that provide us new revenue opportunities to serve the same end use customer channel. That's really why that has – that business has performed at an accretive level, and new product development is clearly the driving force there and will be for the foreseeable future. I spend a high percentage of my time working on the pipeline of new product development with the teams, and if you could see my now, I'm smiling quite robustly. It looks quite good. In terms of inventories, we have intentionally put inventory into the system for two reasons. One is, even with headwinds of weather that existed in the first quarter, we had positive POS. We are not exactly certain what happens from a global perspective as the US thaws and other things continue to advance. The thing we are not going to do is starve our growth. We have the opportunity over three quarters to work through that inventory and if, in fact, there is more demand, we want to be able to serve it. It's not atypical. We do this typically in every first quarter. We've done it at an accelerated level because our growth is also going to accelerate.
John Lundgren: This is John. I will just add, because you won't get a follow-up, Jeff and his team have a 10-year track record, that's my history. Jeff's is a little longer than mine, of doing exactly what Jeff said. SFS was, if you will, born and embedded in the CDIY business. Jeff and his head of operations, there's no one in this Company that understands the benefits, both in terms of cash flow and productivity to high working capital turns, getting the – having supply and demand match, rigorous S&OP process. Of things that I worry about, and there are many, CDIY getting – making sure inventory is in line as the year progresses and driving the continuously improved working capital turns for which they've got an incredible track record, I've got a high degree of confidence that that will continue.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie. Please, go ahead.
Mike Wood: Thank you. Good job with the 31% ex-currency incrementals in CDIY. I'm curious if you can comment if you think you could sustain that level, or if the quarter had the distortions from, say, better efficiency from that inventory build that you just talked about or any delayed promotions around the timing of the spring selling season. Thank you.
John Lundgren: First of all, when we do inventory builds in the first quarter, or any quarter, for that matter, you don't really get the benefit in your P&L until you sell the product to your customers. Because the way the accounting works, you have to basically – any positive variance, or any variance related to that, gets put on your balance sheet, and then it will flow through as your cost of sales when you sell to your customers. There is certainly no impact in the first quarter related to that aspect of it. As far as the FX impact, we did mention there was a $20 million impact to CDIY, which obviously prevented us seeing operating leverage. But when you excluded the impact, you did have that operating leverage. As time goes on here, assuming there's no change in currency rates, the number's going to get a little smaller, just a little bit smaller in the second quarter, but it will still be significant. And in the back half, there will be a still a little bit of negative FX pressure, but it will be at a much smaller pace. And then you will really start to see the operating leverage flow through at that point in time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wendy Clark of UBS. Please go ahead.
Wendy Clark: Good morning. Can you talk about how business trended in your North Americas security business over the course of the quarter? And did business improve meaningfully in March following weather headwinds earlier in the quarter? And then you also continue to see good momentum from your security vertical initiatives. Curious if you are seeing any competitive response at this point.
John Lundgren: Okay, so yes, we did see positive development throughout the quarter. January and February weather were – we had branch closings that really exceeded any days of branch closings that anybody here – since we can remember since we've owned securities, which is about 10 years, over 10 years. So, it was really rough from that perspective. I don't want to overstate the impact, it could've been 1 point of revenue or something like that, that – maybe 2 at most that is derived from that. However, there was definitely a positive trend, as the quarter went on. The vertical initiatives in healthcare and in education and retail, I'd say are the ones we're making the most progress on, especially retail and healthcare. The wins really, I think are just beginning to get our competitors' attention. Most of what we are doing in those areas, we're doing with proprietary differentiated technology, which is really going to be difficult in the very, very short term to compete against in the types of bake offs that we are having. But we expect competitor response at some point, that would be natural and normal. It will be the ones, the bigger companies that can muster a competitive response with technological solutions. I think we all know who those are. We have some that – we have a very big one and we have several that are more vertical focused. You have one that competes heavily in financial services, one that competes heavily in retail, and they are all doing their own thing. But we haven't seen anything directly related to our activities yet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please, go ahead.
Jeff Sprague: I just wanted to come back around to cash flow. Jeff addressed what he's doing on working capital and inventory in his business. But where are the leverage points for the year? What I'm thinking about, is there any scope to reduce the $250 million as you execute through the year? Working capital in the emerging markets as you work that, opportunities on payables. Wondering if the bias to your cash flow this year is potentially to the upside or the downside? Thank you.
Don Allan: I will take that question. I feel really good about where we are with the $675 million. I do think that, like every year, we start out with a large, as I mentioned, working capital negative. The vast majority of that is planned and has been the case for the last three or four years. And then we have the specific actions that we are taking, not only in inventory, but all the other areas of working capital as we progress throughout the year. Of course, there's a big seasonality impact in the fourth quarter that goes the other way, as we see a lot of the revenue in our CDIY business in the month of October and November. And then it slows dramatically in the month of December, which allows us to really collect a lot of receivables, reduce our inventory levels, et cetera. All those dynamics together really drive our confidence and our ability to exceed 8 working capital turns this particular year. As far as other items on the cash flow, we are controlling CapEx, as I mentioned. We want that to be 2.5% of revenue, which is roughly $300 million for the year. We think we are tracking to that. We don't want to starve the CapEx to the point where we cause issues related to revenue or other areas in our business such as productivity projects and our supply chain. But we think we are at the right level with $300 million. And then the one-time payments of $250 million, I think that's a very reasonable balance estimate at this point. I'm certainly not concerned about it being above that number. With anything, it does have the potential to be slightly below it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please, go ahead.
David MacGregor: Yes. Good morning. Question for Jeff on CDIY. I noted that your pricing was down about 1%, and I'm mindful that this might be a mix driven, just giving everything you are doing in the emerging markets. But I'm just wondering if you could talk about all the innovation that you seem to be delivering to market right now and your ability to price that innovation just given competitive developments.
Jeff Ansell: Yes, certainly. The emerging markets platform, 1,000 new products that we outlined, most of which began launching already this year, it does put downward pressure on the absolute price, given that it's MPP versus HPP. That said, we've found a way most recently through – via the acquisition of GQ and the work we've done in those markets to make sure that we are profitable at those price points. While we serve a different market and different price point, we also continue to be squarely profitable in that. The one thing that I would say also in the quarter is we did have benefits from some promotional activity in the first quarter of this year that we didn't have last year, if you recall. We didn't throw out a lot of products. We did have some promotional activity that helped us deliver 6% growth. That said, clearly inside the P&L, operating leverage excluding the currency headwind. All things played together quite well. We don't see a dynamically or dramatically different pricing environment that we had in the previous quarter or the previous several quarters, I would say.
Operator: Our last question comes from Liam Burke from Janney Capital Markets. Please, go ahead.
Liam Burke: Thank you. Good morning, John. Good morning, Jim. Jim, you had a fair amount of success or fair amount of history developing the emerging markets in Latin America. As you continue to grow in Asia Pacific, are those markets developing faster or slower or pretty much the same as you experienced in Latin America?
Jim Loree: I think when we grew in Latin America, we were in a period when Latin America was on fire, so to speak, in a good way, with positive FX, positive economic growth. Some euphoria in Brazil, lack of government intervention in places that we are getting it now and so forth. What we've seen is in some ways, the Latin American market has either matured in some cases, or in other areas, has gone into a volatility stage that John was referring to earlier. So, not a classic development of the market. I think what we see in Asia is that starting with China, you almost have to take them one at a time. China, as everybody knows, for a long time was in the 9% to 10% growth mode, and the growth in China has slipped to maybe 7%, according to the government, maybe less according to what we see. But we still see strong out performance, double-digit growth in China. And the combination of having the hand tools and the power tools, having the MPP and the HPP, great distributional that we have, now moving to interior China with our distribution channels and so forth. I think all of that enables us to have the same kind of development rate that we had in the halcyon days of the development of the Latin American market. India, we don't have a big presence there, and it's just a big question mark as to where India is going, and a lot depends on the election that's going to occur here shortly. In fact, I would just mention that in the emerging markets in general this year, about 60% of the countries are undergoing electoral processes, which creates near-term instability and uncertainty. But – so some of these – the answer to this question is a little bit more medium term I'd say, than long term. Southeast Asia, we see to be a really strong growth area for many years to come. Indonesia, in particular, I think is going to be very, very strong. Thailand, if it could ever get through its political challenges, could be very strong, as well. The Philippines will – is gaining momentum as we speak. I think we are pretty bullish on Southeast Asia in general. Then, as we move over to some of the other regions like the Middle East, it's always a bit of a crapshoot as to what's going to happen there geopolitically. And then Russia and Turkey, big question marks. I think in general, to sum it up, I'd say we are just seeing a lot of volatility. It's not quite clear where the growth is going to be the strongest in any given point in time, or where it's going to be the weakest. Our approach has been place our bets cautiously and conservatively in the areas that we feel are the best places to be, but don't eliminate presence in other areas, because there, you just don't know. So, that's been the approach, and I think we're going to see excellent growth from the emerging markets for years to come. I think we have a nice, strong, I won't call it a head start because I think some of our other competitors got a head start on us. But we are working on a leapfrog at this point in time strategy.
John Lundgren: Liam, the only thing to add to that, I think that's an incredibly good summary of a huge number of geographies with a lot of moving pieces. I believe – I know you are aware of this, but just to remind you, you mentioned Latin America in general. A lot of the early growth in addition to the environment being incredibly robust, as Jim suggested, were Stanley Black & Decker synergies. If you just take the two big regions, or if you take all the other emerging markets, Asia, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Stanley and Black & Decker has similarly-sized businesses, we were both underdeveloped. The opportunity to grow was there, and we've invested in that, as Jim suggested. Black & Decker had a meaningful business in Latin America, Stanley did not. A tremendous amount of the early growth in Latin America were, quite frankly, what we've categorized as revenue synergies. Selling legacy Stanley products through well-established Black & Decker channels of distribution, even producing hand tools in our formerly Black & Decker plant in New Baraba, that gave us a nice jumpstart to growing in Latin America. Just to add to what Jim said, which is, I think, pretty clear.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Greg Waybright for closing remarks.

Operator: Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Stanley Black & Decker Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lorraine, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.
Gregory Waybright: Thank you, Lorraine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR portion of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2:00 p.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, John and Don will review Stanley's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Normally, for -- those of you who follow us know, normally, I would kick this off and turn it over to Jim to deep-dive into some of the segments. And Jim's with us this morning, but he also -- he's recovering from a bad case of the flu and a modest case of laryngitis, so Don and I are going to share the formal part of the presentation. Jim is here and we're going to try to save his voice for Q&A and get him back on the field in full force by Monday. Don?
Donald Allan: Thanks, John. I'd like to start with the summary of our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. The fourth quarter revenues increased 9%, which were driven by a 4% organic growth performance, and the majority of the difference between the 4% and the 9% was the addition of Infastech, as we continued to see a good performance in that business in the first year of acquisition. The fourth quarter diluted EPS was $1.32 before M&A and other restructuring charges, so within our implied guidance range of $1.24 to $1.34, the higher end of the range. And then the GAAP EPS was $0.41, as we recorded several additional restructuring charges that we communicated in December related to some cost actions across all our businesses to improve our operating leverage. CDIY and Industrial posted very compelling top and bottom line growth performances, with CDIY achieving a solid robust organic growth of 6% at a 14.6% operating margin rate. Industrial posted over 16%, a 16.1% operating margin rate and an 8% organic growth story as they continued to see gains across all of their businesses. Our Security recovery is underway, and we delivered margins that were consistent with our expectations, which were relatively consistent with the third quarter at 12.2%. The full year results for 2013 were solid from a revenue performance, with revenues being up 8%, 3% organic growth, which was driven by, primarily, our CDIY and Industrial businesses, which saw 4% and 5% organic growth, respectively. Diluted EPS prior to M&A charges for the year were $4.98, again at the higher end of our guidance range, which was $4.90 to $5 that we provided back in October, and a GAAP EPS of $3.26. Another positive that we saw in the fourth quarter was a very strong free cash flow performance. Our free cash flow for the year before M&A payments was $854 million, and we achieved 8 working capital turns associated with that. That was slightly ahead of our expectation that we communicated in October of $800 million, and most of that out-performance was driven by a stronger working capital turn performance. We also will be reiterating our guidance for 2014 today, with a full year range of $5.30 to $5.50 before approximately $25 million of restructuring, which will be a dramatically lower level of restructuring in 2014 versus 2013. Free cash flow is expected to be $675 million, which is inclusive of about $250 million of onetime payments. I'll provide a little more detail on that later on in the presentation. So overall, a very solid top and bottom line performance in our CDIY and Industrial segments, and we feel our Security recovery is underway. So let's spend a few more minutes talking about our revenue performance, and then I'll hand it over to John to talk about the growth initiatives in the 3 segments. So looking at sources of growth. In the fourth quarter, I mentioned organic growth of 4%, which is a trend that's positive that's continued now for 3 quarters, where we saw the second quarter organic growth performance of 5%; third quarter, 4%; and then as I mentioned, fourth quarter, again, at 4%, for a full year equal to 3% performance. Acquisitions, primarily Infastech, contributing the 6% and then a modest negative of currency, primarily being driven in countries of Canada, Brazil and Argentina. To the right side of the page, looking at the regional revenue performance. You can see that we continue to see a positive trend in our United States revenue performance, up 4% organically in the fourth quarter, 3% for the full year. European performance was flat for the year, up slightly, up 1% in the fourth quarter. And there's various stories within the European performances as you'll hear about from John later on. But some very healthy performances in CDIY and our Industrial segments as we saw mid-single-digit organic growth in those particular segments in the fourth quarter. Emerging markets, as we expected, was a little slower in the fourth quarter, up 5% organically, with a solid 8% organic growth performance for the full year. Resulting in the total performance, as I mentioned, of 4% organic growth for the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. So we definitely feel like that our organic growth initiatives are getting traction, and we are focused on making sure that we turn our European Security business into a positive organic growth story as well. So with that, I'll turn it over to John.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Don. The organic growth initiatives that Don talked about were a real focal point for us in 2013. And this chart captures some of the key highlights of those initiatives, which are taking hold and in fact, driving approximately 2 percentage points or 200 basis points of growth in 2013. From a geographical perspective, our global emerging markets business is growing at 2.5x the rate of the combined market average. That's the market weighted by our 2013 revenues, which reflects our higher-than-normal Latin American concentration. We hired 300 new people. That included key country leaders and key sales positions, primarily feet on the street, but with the focus, again, on customers and driving growth. We dedicated SBUs and business teams versus the specific markets, and we launched approximately 300 new SKUs. Our Tier 2 distributor expansion is progressing. We added about 1,500 new distributors. And last but absolutely, certainly, not least, we're preparing for a mid-product -- mid-priced product launch, and that will be significantly accelerated through the completed acquisition of GQ that Jim talked to you about several quarters ago. It will really allow us to make an in-market specifically designed product for that fast-growing and highly important mid-price-point product in the emerging markets. Our M&A revenue synergies continued. The focus there was in CDIY, where we continued to leverage some Black & Decker synergies, as well as the synergies from the Powers acquisition. Together, they outperformed what we proposed as an original plan by almost twofold in 2013. And as Don suggested, our Security verticals are certainly gaining traction, with about $40 million of 2013 revenue attributable specifically to this activity. The order momentum is building. We've got about $100 million of annualized orders as a result of these initiatives, with the greatest success so far with our global customers in our health care and education verticals. And with these verticals, one of the drivers is to differentiate ourselves, and we're doing that versus competition with these unique offerings. And as a consequence, we're able to command, in most cases, a premium due to the meaningful value proposition. So the most important point to note is these initiatives are margin accretive as a consequence. Let's look now at some of the segments in a little bit more detail, starting with CDIY, where organic growth was up 6%, with all regions delivering solid growth, 6% for the quarter, 4% for the year. North America, up 5%; emerging markets, 8%; and Europe, 7%, consistent with total company. This represents about half our revenue, as you know. Organic growth is posted essentially everywhere, all SBUs reflecting market share gains, driven by both product innovation, introduction and great channel retail partnerships. And as Don mentioned for the total company, it's important to note in the CDIY trend, 4% for the year, CDIY was flat to marginally down in the first quarter, followed sequentially by second, third and fourth quarter organic growth of 6%, 5% and 6%, respectively, leading to 4.3% for the year. So it's on a very solid path, very, very strong trend, and exits the year and enters 2014 in a very, very good place. Looking at segment profit. It's up 7%, and margins up about 10 basis points, with the improvement reflecting both volume and productivity and those impacts offsetting some serious foreign exchange headwinds, as well as the expense of our growth initiative investments. And looking at organic growth in the fourth quarter by our various SBUs, a lot of positivity. Our Professional Power Tools business is up 5%, driven by new product introductions, as well as great performance in the emerging markets. The Consumer Products Group is up 6%. Great success in Europe with steam and hand vacs, good sell-through on North American holiday promotions and again, good performance in the emerging markets. Hand Tools and Storage up 8%. DeWalt Hand Tools being a strong driver. Emerging markets and very good quarter in the U.K., with -- where our business is doing well in an economy that seems to be turning the corner, which hopefully is a good positive indicator for the rest of Europe. And last but certainly not least, in fastening and accessories Bostitch's expansion and Powers revenues led to 8% organic growth in the quarter. So strong both top and bottom line growth in the face of currency headwinds and a good solid quarter for CDIY in the fourth quarter. Moving on to Industrial. Solid quarter, again, delivering 27% revenue growth, of which 8% came from volume. Pricing was flat. Acquisitions, primarily Infastech, contributed 20%. And currency was a 1% negative. The OM rate of 16.1% was strong as volume leverage was offset by the expense from the growth investments, as well as foreign exchange. Looking with inside -- within the segment, IAR had strong European growth. We had the EQUIP AUTO fair, a very important event in Europe. We had strength in MRO and vending , as well as Mac Tools. And those positives were partially offset by weak government sales, which are normally strong in the fourth quarter, particularly in October. Greg and Dennis have fielded a lot of questions on just what is the magnitude. And for clarity, it's about $6 million, we felt, of lost revenue, which is about 2% globally but 4% for our North American IAR business. And the EQUIP AUTO, to which I referred, is a very important event that takes place in France, but it's a European automotive and industrial tool event, contributed about 3% -- $3 million, excuse me, which is about 1% globally and 4% in Europe to our IAR business. So even without EQUIP AUTO, European IAR would have shown positive growth and again, another really good sign for the performance of that business in that market. Good strong quarter for Engineered Fastening. Automotive share gains leading to organic growth, again, for the third or fourth consecutive quarter, in excess of light vehicle production. Light vehicle production grew about 4%. We grew 5-plus organically. The Infastech integration is on schedule. It's tracking well versus expectations. And a great turnaround story in our infrastructure business. Oil & Gas up over 35% organically, driven by a combination of the North American onshore growth, as well as offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico and in Brazil. So a good solid quarter in Industrial. Margin rates are strong despite the investments and some foreign currency headwinds that we'll continue to deal with through 2014, and Don will talk a little bit more about that in the outlook. Moving on to Security. The improvement is underway. Margins were consistent with the third quarter. But I think, ultimately, it's helpful to separate North America and Europe because they're on very different improvement trajectories. Going across the top of the chart. Globally, revenues were down 2%, 3% organically. And segment profit is down 27% or 400 basis points. Looking sequentially, segment operating profit of 12.2% was flat versus the third quarter, making second half margin rate up 160 basis points versus the first half. But I think, importantly, let's look inside the 2 different businesses. On the left, our North American and emerging market businesses were flat in terms of growth, with a strong 17.4% operating margin. The emerging markets and automatic doors growth, which was strong, was offset by a comparison versus our fourth quarter '12 commercial lock distributor loading. Jim has discussed in a lot of detail, the change in our operating model. I'll touch on it a little bit more in a minute. But for perspective, for all of -- the fourth quarter was down in SMS about 5%, which meant they were plus 1% for the year. If you adjusted for that load-in, it would be about plus 14% for the fourth quarter and about plus 11% for the year. We got the benefit a year ago, call it pipeline, so it shows up in the comps this year. But we think it was an absolutely critical change to make and the business seems to be in the right place. The sequential operating margin rate improvement also continues in North America. Measurable improvements in field efficiency led to stronger install margins. Our backlog conversion was up 2 to 3 points. And as I mentioned earlier, the vertical solutions have been accretive to margin. We've shown a lot of price discipline. If we've lost any business, it's been due to price. But we feel that we're commanding a premium for our value proposition, and we're getting it. And it's demonstrated in a 265-basis-point increase to 16.1%, if you look at the entire second half of the year when those programs started to gain traction. And as I discussed a second ago, the commercial lock transition it is complete. The distributors have replaced the direct sales model, which was a significant change for us in the last 12 months, but we think a very important one relative to our long-term growth objectives. Turning to Europe. Volume down 8% organically -- or sales down 8% organically and 4.3% operating margin. Lower backlog conversion and RMR attrition continued to be the issues. That being said, we had a double-digit order rate improvement in the fourth quarter, and RMR attrition has slowed to the mid-teens. It's down about 200 basis points from the level of the first half of the year and continues, we think, on the right track, albeit at a pace slower than we'd like to see it. And as I'll say in a minute, our objective, long -- intermediate to long term, is RMR attrition at about a 10% rate. We've announced cost reductions to resize the business. We've applied a lot stronger centralized daily management model, which is perfectly applicable to Europe, some of the best practices from our U.S. business. Again, improve backlog conversion efficiency and managing RMR down to 10% from the mid-teens level where it is today. Importantly, not mentioned on the chart, our health care business is included in our external reporting for Security. We've not spent much time on it. It's a relatively small business but had a very solid fourth quarter in terms of its performance against -- advancement against its strategic objectives. Revenue performance, an 11.7% operating margins. So continuing its upward trend in a business that we think could -- we continue to think could have great prospects for growth, margin and shareholder value creation in the future. Let me turn it back to Don to talk about the fourth quarter cash flow, with which we were quite pleased. And then we'll get back to an outlook and open it up to Q&A.
Donald Allan: Thanks, John. So let's spend a little bit of time on the fourth quarter free cash flow, as well as the full year. You can see that our free cash flow did exceed our revised expectations. In October, we provided guidance of free cash flow for the full year of $800 million, as I mentioned earlier. Also, embedded in that expectation was that working capital turns would probably achieve about 7.7 to 7.8 turns for the full year. As you see, our turn performance is actually 8 working capital turns, which was a solid performance year-over-year, up about 0.5 turn versus 2012. So where we expected, in October, a slight negative from working capital for the full year, we actually saw a slight positive of $13 million. That drove the vast majority of the improvement, as many of our business teams were focused on enhancing the working capital performance through making permanent long-term changes to their business, in line with the Stanley Fulfillment System and staying focused on those objectives, along with achieving the right level of earnings and organic growth performance. Overall, when you look at the GAAP performance of free cash flow, was $500 million for 2013 versus $580 million for 2012, and we expect that number to be $675 million for 2014. To make it comparable, excluding the M&A payments in 2014, it will be $925 million versus the $854 million. So as we -- we would expect continued modest improvement in working capital and obviously, earnings accretion as well associated with our EPS projections. We believe that the free cash flow of this company continues to be an area that we can differentiate ourselves versus other companies. And as we move away from many of the large M&A and other restructuring charges over the next 2 years, we will begin to approach that $1 billion objective on a GAAP basis. So with that, I'd like to spend a few minutes reiterating the 2014 outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the EPS to be $5.30 up to $5.50 of EPS on an -- before the M&A charges. On a GAAP basis, we expect it to be $5.18 to $5.38, so approximately $25 million of restructuring charges, down dramatically from the approximately $400 million we saw in 2013. I mentioned the free cash flow projections for next year, so I won't touch on that again. Some of the assumptions within the guidance have remained consistent with what I mentioned in December. So 4% organic growth is expected approximately for next year, which is relatively consistent with what we've seen over the last 3 quarters in our company. 150-basis-point improvement in Security margin, so all those things that John touched on that we're seeing come to life in the North American business and the expectation of what will occur in our European business as the year goes on will drive that improvement. We also discussed in December some surgical cost reductions we did across our other businesses, in CDIY, the Industrial segment and then some corporate actions that will drive about $0.20 of EPS improvement year-over-year. And then of course, in year 2 of our integration of Infastech, we expect some synergies and accretion in that business that will drive about $0.10 of EPS improvement. On the headwind side, as we mentioned in December, we have -- we do expect carryover pressure of foreign currency. And so where we saw about $60 million of negative currency effects in 2013 in the -- primarily in the back half of the year, we would expect a very similar number to occur in the first half of 2014, which would equate to about a $0.30 negative in EPS. Tax rate will be slightly higher versus our 19 -- roughly 19.5% tax rate we saw in 2013, we're somewhere between 21% and 22%. There's a few onetime items that occurred in '13 we don't expect to repeat. And then a little bit higher interest and a few other costs will drive a slight negative of $0.10 to $0.15 as well. One other item of note I want to just have people focus on is just the timing of the quarters for 2014. As usual, we do have a seasonality impact in the first quarter, but it is slightly lower than normal history based on 2 factors: one, the foreign exchange impact that I mentioned carrying over from the back half of 2013; and then two, we do have a slightly higher tax rate in the first quarter this year versus the first quarter last year, as we did record approximately a $10 million benefit, onetime benefit, in the first quarter of 2013. So as a result, we expect the first quarter to be roughly between $0.95 and $0.98 EPS. A little bit of segment outlook to the right side of the page. We expect mid-single-digit organic growth in both our CDIY and Industrial businesses for 2014, again, very consistent with what we've seen, especially in the last 2 or 3 quarters in these businesses. The Security business, from a revenue perspective, will be flat to maybe a modest increase as we expect North America and emerging markets to continue to demonstrate some solid organic growth, especially as we see the organic growth initiatives become even stronger in North America. And then the European business will probably be down slightly versus prior year as we expect to see a little bit pressure, especially in RMR attrition, in the first half of the year, as we begin to see that flatten out in the back half and achieve the 10% RMR attrition rate that we'd like to see in that business going forward. Operating margin. We expect increases year-over-year in the operating margin rate for both CDIY and Industrial, as we see the leverage effect of the organic volume. Of course, that's partially offset by the FX that I discussed. And we also see a benefit of some of the cost actions that we've taken that are surgical in nature. And then the operating margin rate for Security I touched on, with 150-basis-point improvement year-over-year. The last thing I would say is, as I mentioned earlier, the M&A charges go down dramatically in 2014, from a level of $400 million approximately in 2013 to $25 million in 2014, dramatically closing the difference between U.S. GAAP and EPS on adjusted basis, which is one of our primary objectives for 2014. I'd like to spend a little bit of time on the next page going through emerging markets and foreign exchange. As many of you are aware, we had significant impacts in 2013 and as I discussed, expect some more significant impacts in the first half of 2014 related to this. In the page we show the currency trend versus the U.S. dollar, for really the 4 major currencies that tend to have a significant impact on us. The first 3 have historically had a large impact on us since the merger: the European euro, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. The Argentinian peso has become more challenging over the last few years, as that country continues to see governmental challenges and economic issues. If you look at the euro, it's been relatively flat over the last 12 months, actually a slight improvement, about 3% versus the U.S. dollar. However, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real has seen 11% and 15%, respectively, devaluations versus the U.S. dollar, with a lot of that happening since June of 2013. The Argentinian peso, approximately 40% in that same time horizon. To give you some context in the size of the businesses in these countries so you have a sense of that. Our European business is just under $3 billion, about $2.9 billion in revenue. The Canadian business is approximately $0.5 billion in revenue. Our Brazilian business is $230 million in revenue, and our Argentinian business is $115 million in revenue. That gives you some context of the size of the businesses that you start to look at some of the magnitude of these changes. Now when we look at where does this impact our businesses, it impacts primarily our CDIY business. About 80% of these impacts go into CDIY, with the other 20% hitting our Industrial businesses, which is mostly Industrial & Automotive Repair and Engineered Fastening. It's driven by the global supply chain that we've created, where we do have a lot of business that is imported into, in particular, Latin America and Canada. So it's manufactured in other countries and imported into those regions, and as a result, it's U.S. dollar-based and can drive a significant currency impact when that -- when we have a shift in currency either way. What do we do from a mitigation perspective related to that? Obviously, there's many things that we do. In Latin America and Canada, we're always looking at potential for price increases with our customers as the currency moves. If we use Latin America as an example, over the last 2 years as we've seen the effects of shift, we've had numerous price increases in many of the countries over that time horizon to offset the impact. Obviously, the timing is a little different than the shift that you see related to currency, but overall, we try to do our best to pass on as much as we can to the end user and our customers. We're also focused on cost controls in those particular areas. We do look at localizing production where we have enough mass in certain countries. In the case of Brazil, we do have certain levels of production down there, and we continue to evaluate moving more production into that country, but we have to make sure we balance that against ensuring that we have the lowest cost possible when you factor in the currency as well. And then last but certainly not least, in some countries, we are focused on what hedging activities we can do against the currencies. In the case of Brazil and Argentina, it's very difficult to do that. It's either very cost ineffective or in the case of Argentina, it's almost impossible to do it due to certain regulation. The last thing I'd like to touch on is just the estimated financial impact of some of the movements of these currencies. So over the last few years, I've provided you some detail on this, and I just like to reiterate that. I already discussed what the dollar impact is for 2013 and 2014 of these movements. But if you look at the 4 different currencies, you can see here that a 1% movement of the Canadian dollar has about a $3 million to $4 million annual impact in our P&L; the euro is about $1.5 million to $2.5 million per 1% move; and then the Brazilian real is a $1.5 million to $2 million movement on an annual basis; and then you see the Argentinian peso as well, which is a much smaller number. This is really more for you to be aware and educated based on how these movements can impact us, both in the history but also on a go-forward basis. And our guidance is predicated really on where rates are today, and we'll continue to be focused on what actions we can take, as I mentioned, and the mitigating factors as we see shift beyond where these rates are today and how we can respond to them to ensure that we achieve our guidance for 2014. So with that, I'd like to summarize the presentation portion of the call this morning. The company remains committed to driving both long-term and near-term shareholder value. We discussed that in great deal -- detail in our December call. The fourth quarter was the first step forward in really delivering on those operational commitments we laid out in that time horizon. CDIY and Industrial posted very strong revenue and growth, which we were pleased with. And we're also very pleased with our Security recovery. It really is underway, and we saw notable improvements in our North American business that John discussed. And all the actions are in place to drive the European business in a similar fashion over the next 12 to 18 months. For 2014, we're very focused on improving our near-term returns and enhancing our operating leverage. And as a result, our organic growth initiative is still a very significant part of our priorities. But we're really trying to leverage the investments that we've already made. We're not looking to make new investments in 2014 beyond those investments. The Security margin improvement, 150 basis points, is a key priority as well. We've taken surgical cost actions across our other businesses to ensure that operating leverage that I mentioned in the CDIY and Industrial segments. And then we'll never forget about the importance of staying focused on working capital and ensuring that we continue to show improvement year-over-year. We are, again, focused on making sure that our capital allocation is a bit rebalanced for the next 2 years as we will continue our acquisition moratorium, be focused on deleveraging our balance sheet and repurchasing our shares of up to $1 billion over the next few years. This really positions our company, we believe, to deliver on our long-term financial objectives.
Gregory Waybright: Great. Don, thanks. Lorraine, we can now open the call to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.
Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Two questions. On the Europe -- on the Security margin improvement, Don, can you give us a framework within the full year guidance of what you expect European margin to be? So it's 4% in the fourth quarter. At the low end of the range, how should -- what do you need to get to the low end of the range in Europe? And then what do you need to get to the high end? And then for '14, are you -- how much of a recovery in nonresidential construction in the U.S. are you assuming in what's embedded in the guidance?
Donald Allan: Yes. So Rich, it's -- European Security, as I mentioned, I think the first half will continue to see some challenges, although we expect some modest improvement in the operating margin rate in the first half of the year. But many of the cost actions, first of all, will not be implemented till June and July time frame given the process of the European Union and the work councils that we discussed back in December. However, we are very much focused on the revenue attrition side, RMR attrition, making sure we slow that down in a significant way. So we expect to see improvement in that in the first half, which will help the operating margins. So I would say we see a modest improvement in the first portion of the year, and then the back half of the year is where we see a more significant component of improvement in that particular business.
John F. Lundgren: Don, that might be just -- because Rich will get cut off. We're not going to forecast margins by business by quarter, Rich. You know that. But it's a very fair question given the focus we've put on it. To help you in your modeling and your thinking at least, for the year, we've said we're modeling and planning 150-basis-point increase in our Security business.
Donald Allan: In total.
John F. Lundgren: And the U.S. is operating -- it always can improve, but it's operating at or near historical margins. And Europe is 40% of the business, so -- of our Security business. So you are more than capable of doing the math. And as Don said, it will be more backloaded than front loaded because things take time in Europe. I hope that will help you without us getting into dicing and slicing the businesses that we have no intention of doing.
Donald Allan: Yes. And then on your second question, Rich, about non-resi and what we've kind of put in our outlook for 2014. We really haven't factored a dramatic improvement in the non-resi industry within our guidance. Most of our guidance is focused on general market performance today, as well as, in the case of Security in North America, it's very much focused on the vertical organic initiatives that John touched on. We're really trying to continue to enhance those, push those forward and make more progress than we saw in 2013. The progress we saw in '13 was very encouraging, but our expectation is that it's going to continue to really leverage the organic growth story within the North American business.
Operator: And our next question comes from Peter Lisnic from Baird.
Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: This is Josh Chan filling in for Pete. I was wondering about your North American margin performance this quarter. Do you consider that to be sort of a long-term run rate? Or do you see a further improvement in that level ahead? And if so, what will be the driver for further development even from this level?
John F. Lundgren: Don will take it. North America consists of 3 different businesses, so we're going to -- we'll have to take it piece by piece.
Donald Allan: You're talking about North American Security, specifically? I would...
Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Security margins, yes.
Donald Allan: Yes, so that helps clarify. So I think, as John mentioned, we are closing -- approaching kind of historical levels for that. So although we do expect it to get better slightly beyond what we saw in the fourth quarter in 2014, we did take some cost actions, as I mentioned, in this business that will help that performance. We are going to continue to move forward on the vertical organic growth initiatives, which are margin -- gross margin accretive to that business and enhance the margin performance. So all those things that we're doing, and of course, the SMS transition, as we continue to work through that and leverage up that business, as the volume improves, would also improve margins. So we would expect it to improve. But you also have to recognize that it's at a high level, but it's probably at the low end of the range of historical level.
John F. Lundgren: Let me just supplement that to remind you. Don -- when Don talked about first quarter guidance in fourth quarter, remember, first quarter, for our company, has some seasonality. In CDIY, as everyone knows, January is a very soft month because that's when our large retail customers end their fiscal year and have a close eye on -- for very good reason, have a close eye on their inventory. So in CDIY, it's about a 2.5 month quarter as opposed to a 3-month quarter. But more importantly, Security, historically, and this continues in North America, is a business with some seasonality. And historically -- if you look, our second and third quarters, from a margin perspective, historically, all things being equal, are better than first and fourth. There's 2 reasons for that. Most of it's in the mechanical area. But in the fourth and first quarters, particularly our Stanley Access Technologies business; to a lesser extent, our mechanical locking business, we get into weather issues on install. We're scheduled to do a job, there's a snowstorm, the foundation is in port, we can't put in the door or we can't upgrade the door. Those are real issues that can have some headwind in the fourth and first quarter. Secondly, our education vertical, for obvious reasons, performs much stronger in the second and third quarter. We do a lot more work in the education vertical in the months of -- a little bit of June but particularly, July and August, when there are fewer students on campus and we're allowed to do that work. So as you're looking at quarters and years, keep that -- and doing your modeling, and we're happy to talk about because it's -- we've got a lot of history, just do keep those 2 things in mind.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jason Feldman from UBS.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So on Security, I'm just curious what kind of visibility you have to kind of flat or better Security sales next year, given the headwinds that you've faced. And then if you can also put this double-digit order growth in European Security kind of into context for us. With mid-teens attrition, is kind of mid-double-digit order growth what you need to keep the business flat? Or is there some different way that we should be thinking about that?
John F. Lundgren: Jim wants everybody to know he's alive and well. And we hope you can hear him, Jason. I picked him up.
James M. Loree: So this is my 58th consecutive quarterly conference call and I didn't want to miss it. So bear with me, and I apologize for the voice. But taking them separately, North America and Europe, the total will be flat to slightly up. Europe will be slightly down for the year. With 10% attrition, we need 5% order growth to be flat, basically, because the RMR part of the portfolio is about 50% of the portfolio. So we expect to go from where we are today, which is mid-teens attrition, down to about 10% attrition by the middle of the year. So we will have about 12% attrition for the year, which means we would need an order rate in excess of 6% to be positive. We won't -- we're not expecting to be positive in Europe on an organic basis in 2014, but we do expect that attrition to come down. And over time, we'll convert that order backlog that we have into sales, and we're working very diligently on making sure that we have all the routines in place to make sure that we do that effectively. We have a good momentum going in the verticals, as has been mentioned previously, in North America, so that gives us a lot of confidence that we will have positive organic growth in North America. We see a positive trend in Access Technologies, a positive trend in CSS. The big question mark is SMS. We have positive unit volumes for the first time in many, many years in mechanical. We think we're going to have a favorable market ahead of us. We've got a lot of work being done in specifying, on construction jobs. And so all signs are positive, but they're still a work in progress in the mechanical business in North America.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Two questions. I'll ask them quickly so -- in case I get cut off. The first one, last year, you mentioned, John, that the first quarter represents about 18% to 19%, historically, of annual earnings. And your guidance here of $0.95 to $0.98 versus your annual guidance is still in that 18% to 19% range. But I would think it would be lower than that this year because of the Security gains as the -- I mean margin as the year progresses, some of the restructuring savings as it progresses. So why wouldn't the first quarter this year be lower as a percentage of the overall expected earnings? That will question 1. And the second question would be, based on the FX challenges in the emerging markets, are you contemplating paring back some of your discretionary spending in 2014 based on the macro and current currency headwinds there?
Donald Allan: Sam, it's Don. So I'll take those questions. The first one, the 18% to 19% was actually a 10-year historical kind of range that we experienced. That was more before the merger. So when you look at the post-merger company, and we saw it again in 2013, the first quarter represents more of a 20% to 21% of the full year. And so that's really, in my view, the new starting base of this company when you look at first quarter to total year. And that's why I think the 18% actually is down slightly from that range because of the items I mentioned of FX and tax that are driving that.
John F. Lundgren: And the items that Sam mentioned.
Donald Allan: And the items you mentioned as well. And then, as far as your other question around discretionary costs, yes, we are very much focused as a company on dramatically controlling our discretionary costs. We obviously took a very significant restructuring program across the company in the fourth quarter and have executed many of those actions. We still have many that we have to do, especially in Europe. But just as importantly, the costs -- or the non-people costs, we are very much focused on reducing travel where we have certain consulting activities. We've cut way back on those levels of activities. The other costs related to -- any one that's connected to a person, the phone calls, et cetera, we are very much focused on how we can reduce that. Some of it's contractual in nature, so we negotiate with our vendors, and others it's just more of a policy change or a volume level of activity. That's something that will be 1 of our top 5 priorities for the year until we see more stabilization, especially in emerging markets.
John F. Lundgren: And Sam, I'll just add because you won't get a follow-up. SG&A is something we talk about in great detail at the highest level of this company, even with our -- and with our board, and all SG&A or discretionary costs, if you want to use that term, as we've said many times, it isn't bad. Our investment in brand, our investment in people, in feet on the street, our investment in product development, building SBUs is the last place where we're going to pare back. What we may do is slow the pace of acceleration. I mean, there was a huge incremental lift in that in 2013. But we truly do, as I think most companies do, in good conscience, divide all discretionary costs into 2 buckets. Those that are creating revenue through generating new products, creating revenue and building brand franchises versus those that are just required to run our business. And it's the latter that's under closer scrutiny than ever and looking at significant cuts. The former will not increase at the rate they increased in 2013 nor were they ever planned to. They'll be closer to flat in 2014.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Research: On the update call you hosted last month, you talked about 12% attrition. My understanding, that may have been for November. But it seems, like, for the quarter, it was back up in mid-teens in your presentation. Can you just talk about how that is versus your expectations? And to the extent the attrition is driven by any kind of irrational price competition, would you be chasing that business? Or would you just cede that share?
John F. Lundgren: Yes. Mike, I'll give you a top line. This is John. And then you can follow-up with Greg because he can give you as much detail as you want that we feel we're willing to publicly disclose. What you said is correct. We were improving at a faster rate quite frankly than we expected in November, and it digressed or reverted in December. So the quarter ended up being flat sequentially in terms of attrition. That being said, I don't manage this business nor does Massimo Grassi, who runs it, day-to-day or even quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, we look at the trends. Second half versus first half, we were down 200 basis points. If we repeat that again in the first half, it will be -- we'll be down 200 or 300 basis points. And as Jim said, our target by the end of the year is 10%. We're tracking to get there or slightly shorter, but that remains our objective. But your statement is absolutely correct. December was poor relative to October, November, and we've not reduced the focus on it one bit.
Donald Allan: Yes. The only thing I would add to that is that as we -- we really highlighted that in December as an encouraging sign. But in October, when we provided guidance, our expectation was the attrition was going to be flat in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, which is really what we saw. So we really highlighted that in December, more that we were seeing potential for encouragement there. And we still see that, but this business will see those types of fluctuations month-to-month.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Dahl from Crédit Suisse.
Michael Dahl - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I wanted to ask about Security also but on the North American side. Could you talk about what trends you're seeing on the RMR in North America, what type of conversion you're getting from some of the stronger install and also maybe talk about which verticals you're seeing the most momentum in?
John F. Lundgren: Yes. I'll talk about which verticals we're seeing the most momentum in, which I already did in the presentation, with our global customers, with health care and in education. We're not going to talk about the beginning of your question. It's nothing we do in the public domain, and we think it would provide more, I'll say, competitive damage than it would be helpful information to our investor base.
James M. Loree: The only thing I would...
John F. Lundgren: Jim may want to add something.
James M. Loree: Yes. The only thing -- the way I would answer that question is that our RMR base, without any acquisitions, grew in 2013. So it is moving in the right direction. We're not going to talk about specific RMR attachment rates.
John F. Lundgren: And the verticals, did you want to mention...
James M. Loree: I did. I do.
John F. Lundgren: Okay. All right.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kenneth Zener from KeyBanc.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: With 1Q guidance coming in below consensus, I just want you to be as clear as possible. So at the $60 million FX, is that going to be split kind of equally 1 and 2Q since it's front loaded, a? And b, is your 1Q tax rate higher than your 21% to 22% guidance for the year? First question.
Donald Allan: Well, the $60 million of FX is pretty much divided in half, Q1, Q2. So it's not perfect that way, but that's a good way to think about it. And the tax rate for Q1 this year will be relatively in line with our expectation for the full year. So -- but remember that in the first quarter of last year, the tax rate was around 16%.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Correct. And then I guess if you could give us the lessons learned on -- as well as educate us on emerging market. How the -- since the distrib -- you're accessing more selling points there. Part of the decelerated expectation in growth I think was related to, probably, lower demand, a, but it was also some excess load-in that you guys might have perceived as demand. So how do you guys manage those channels of distribution given that they're less technical? You have less weekly runs of data in terms of sell-through and sell-in. So what did you learn in '13? And how is that -- those -- how are those channels different than the big box we're used to domestically?
James M. Loree: If you're talking about load-in issues, we did mention, last quarter, that there was some issues, in particular, in China, with respect to the distribution channels becoming congested as we grew our T2 distribution channel in China. What we're really finding in China, as we sit here today, is there is a deceleration going on in the market, and there is a credit crunch going on. And we're starting to really see a very tight credit situation with the channel. So it's not as much that -- it's not as much of a load-in issue as it's inability of the distributors to finance purchases to meet what could be growing end-user demand. But with the issue in the channel, it's almost impossible for the distributors to buy the product that they need. And it's a really interesting phenomenon going on in China right now. And if you've been following the news over the last couple of days, there's been some indication from the Central Bank in China that they are beginning to realize that there's a credit crunch with the small to mid-sized businesses, and we're seeing that.
Operator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: Hoping you can go back and just talk a little more about the attrition rates and some of the market dynamics around those attrition rates. And specifically, I guess, is this a dissatisfaction with historical Niscayah execution or is the reaction to increased effort by your competitors?
John F. Lundgren: It's some of each, David. As we've discussed on previous calls, we've had a lot more price discipline. The Niscayah European model, and Jim has gone into great detail on this in previous calls and Greg can -- Greg, I know, will be happy to provide or reinforce that offline. In the interest of time, I'll try to do it quickly. We're trying to turn this organization from farmers to hunters. Historically, Niscayah relied on referrals from its parent company, Securitas, and those have gone away. They -- it was much more of an install model with less attachment than the model that Stanley Convergent Security Solutions, both in U.S. and Europe, have operated. So there was essentially a model change or the way business was done change as a result of our acquisition of Niscayah. And quite frankly, we -- or they, the Niscayah folks, relied more on those referrals than we realized, thus attrition was higher. Second has been pricing discipline on our part. If, in fact, we're going to do an installation, we've gotten much better at costing. We want to be sure those are at least -- at worst, breakeven if it has some RMR attached to it; otherwise, that it's at a reasonable margin. That also has contributed to the growing attrition. And thirdly is we've changed a lot of people. The folks that were relying on the referrals, and it's not even meant to be derogatory, but were much more farmers than hunters, weren't going to make it in the system and business that we're trying to operate. And we believe we have very capable leaders. But in our -- 3 of our -- or 4 of our largest markets, we have new general managers in those markets in place within the last 6 months. They've come either from the industry or related industries, from blue-chip companies, all of whom Jim, Don, myself have met and Brett and Massimo have interviewed intensively. So we think we've got a new team on the field that's going to help as well. So you got a lot of factors contributing to it. You touched on a couple. And hopefully, I added a little more light. But please follow up with Greg and Dennis, and they'll ...
James M. Loree: And I would just add. There's one other competitive dynamic which is relevant here, which is that the -- electronics are gradually, and maybe now at an accelerating rate, replacing guards in commercial buildings and establishments. And this places tremendous pressure on the guarding companies, and that's one reason I suspect that Securitas probably tried to acquire Niscayah because of its electronic capabilities. So without an electronic company -- you have several major European security companies, which are guard-focused and fairly large. Their typical operating margin appetite is about a 4% to 6% operating margin, and that's quite satisfactory to them. So that competition for what I'll call the commodity-type services is pretty intense right now in Europe and probably more intense than it has been in years. So for us, the answer is moving to the vertical solutions that we're implementing in North America. But in order to do that, first, we have to get the sales force in place, which we've done, and we're working on maturing that sales force now. We're working on getting the attrition down to stabilize the revenue base, mature the organization enough so it can handle the vertical market solutions, and that's about 6 to 12 months out. Once we start getting the vertical market solutions from North America imported into Europe, that competitive pressure that we're feeling will be muted to some extent, and the higher-margin business that we'll bring in will really help turn the Niscayah situation around.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I guess a couple of questions here. I just don't want to get cut off. Looking at, for a change of pace here, construction and industrial. If I calculated right, kind of stripping out the negative impact of FX, if you're saying that roughly 80% of the $60 million headwind was in CDIY, it looks like 2013 CDIY was about 15.7% margin, and it translates to a 33% incremental margin. Are those numbers right? And as you think about that business going forward, do you look at, like, a 30%, 35% incremental as a sustainable basis given that, that business, I would say, best case is kind of a mid-teens to high-teens type margin business? Or how to think about that longer term?
Donald Allan: Well, I think if you -- the way that you did the math around the currency to get to kind of what's the operating margin rate without the currency is reasonably accurate, so I would agree with that. But you also have to remember that you're not seeing as much leverage in '13 because we've made some growth investments, too, in SG&A, especially in emerging markets within CDIY. So I do think when the business stabilizes and we're not making those types of investments, which will be in the latter half of '14, assuming no other changes in currency, that the leverage drop-through rate is more of a 35% to 38% number in that business versus what you're seeing now because of the -- both the FX and the growth investments.
Operator: And our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays.
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a sort of follow-up on that one. If you could explain what you think the incremental margins are in the other businesses given the changes that have occurred. And I guess, more broadly, also, if you could talk about -- in CDIY and Industrial, you had some pretty good organic growth generally. And I was curious how much of that you think is attributable to the initiatives that you've been doing in those businesses, implementing versus, let's say, the overall market improvement.
Donald Allan: So as far as incremental margins, I mentioned CDIY already. Industrial has very similar, depending on the business. So there's 4 different businesses in there. It can range anywhere from 30% to 35% incremental margins. Security is a different animal because it depends on the region, the type of business. And it can have a different level of leverage or operating leverage depending on which piece of it, and it can range anywhere from a 20% number to a 35% number. So that's difficult to really say, to have a perfect one for that. I think the more important thing about Security right now is it's continuing its recovery, getting it to the levels of profitability that we want to see, at the same time, seeing the right levels of organic growth that are consistent with our long-term financial objectives. And then, at that point, when that is stabilized, we can start to talk about what's the right level of leverage we're going to see in that business going forward.
John F. Lundgren: You want to take the second part, Don? How much of it was our initiatives? We've said 200 basis points. But if you want to provide some more color, if you want to provide more color on...
Donald Allan: Security specifically?
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: No, for the...
John F. Lundgren: Whole portfolio. I think Steve was asking about the whole portfolio. He won't get back on. But Steve, what we've said is roughly 200 basis points of our top line growth, we felt, was attributable to the growth initiatives. To the extent we can maintain that growth rate at lower initiatives, obviously, that will have a positive impact on incremental margin, if I got the gist of your question.
Operator: And our next question comes from Liam Burke from Janney Capital Markets.
Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: John, you had another pretty decent contribution on the IAR side from Mac Tools. Is that market share gains or just firming end markets? And in Europe, you had promotional activity driving positive growth on the IAR side. Is that sustainable as the promotional activities ease off?
John F. Lundgren: Well, the promotional growth was more CDIY than IAR, Liam. But it is -- no worries, it is sustainable. We had terrific performance in IAR in Europe and CDIY in Europe. But I may have misspoken or you misunderstood that there was much promotion in -- I shouldn't say that. It's a busy promotional quarter for CDIY in Europe in the fourth quarter because of the strength of the Black & Decker consumer products franchise in Europe in general and the U.K. in particular. That being said, I did talk about EQUIP AUTO, which normally happens -- often happens in September. This year, it just happened to happen in October. From a U.S. perspective, think Mac Tools Fair. It's a huge pan-European exhibition that does contribute positively to revenue, and it was very well received. So I might have sent you mixed signal there. In terms of Mac, it's going from -- you've followed us a long time, and Jim has been reporting on this longer, I'm just going to help him save his voice. It's gone from bad to good, and it's going from good to better. And it's a combination of several things. We really, really worked hard on net distributor adds. We've worked really hard on having the right distributors and their productivity, mentoring, training, retaining. But it's also what they have on their truck. We've also -- we have an improved financing program for them, which is far more competitive than what we've sent them to battle with in the past, and our Treasury Department deserves a lot of credit for that. So those are the -- in the back, that's kind of the underlying points. But in fact, what they've got in the truck's are a lot better than what they've had before. It was overwhelmingly 100% sourced business with no proprietary technology. Now a significant percentage of what they're selling are produced in our facilities ever since we combined Mac, Proto and Vidmar under one leadership team, made it part of North American IAR. Those cross-SBU synergies are really, really, really gaining traction. We also have the capability, since the merger, to have DeWalt tools on a Mac tool truck. That's a big draw. So we've got a lot of things in terms of basic blocking and tackling that we've improved with Mac. But I think, most importantly, we've got a dramatically better line of products on the truck in terms of both what we're offering, innovation, margin for the distributor, and it's all working to make this -- it's always been a good franchise. Now it's a good business, and it's going to do nothing but become a better business under the leadership of the current management team.
James M. Loree: And in the fourth quarter, they celebrated their 16th consecutive quarter of organic growth, which for those of you that have been following the company a long time would find that almost miraculous.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA.
Jeremie Capron - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Could you comment on the price, cost dynamics in your tools business, particularly CDIY, where you think you've been gaining share?
John F. Lundgren: So the question was price, cost dynamic, sure.
Donald Allan: Yes. I would say that, I've said it before about our CDIY business, it's a situation that is a fine balance of going after volume and controlling your pricing decisions in this business. I think there's many pieces of it that have significant levels of competition, especially on the power tools side, that you have to be smart about when you do promotional activities, how you do promotional activities. And also, ultimately, a driver of many of those decisions is all the new product introductions that we've put into the marketplace. And ultimately, those things drive the market share gains that we've experienced, especially the last couple of years. We made great progress, especially with our cordless power tool products over that time horizon. And as a result, we've been able to really continue to combat some of the price pressures you see in that particular space. But we all know that's a challenging aspect of this business. But as long as you have that DNA around new product introductions and driving technology and innovation into that marketplace that the user wants versus giving them something that they don't want, you ultimately can really continue to combat that. And I think you saw that in the performance, where there's a modest price negative in the business in 2013. We're never satisfied with that. As we go into 2014, we want to continue to focus on how we minimize that impact and maybe eventually, turn that into a price positive. But ultimately, that's the dynamic of the business today. And then we're not satisfied with it, but we think we have all the right, as I mentioned, DNA in the business that allows us to be very competitive, continue to have a premium to many of our competitors as well.
John F. Lundgren: Yes. And Jeremie, let me just add on to that. We've said this before on calls. It's our largest business. It's -- we think it's well managed, and it has the benefit of being a market leader, #1 and #2 in virtually every category where it competes, so it's not only our right, it's our obligation to behave like price leaders. That being said, there's tremendous competition in the market, particularly in power tools, which is relatively new to the Stanley management team post Black & Decker merger. Having said all that, operating margins were up 10 basis points, all in. And the reason we've been able to do that and maintain it is real prices -- in this category, real prices have declined 1% to 2% a year for the last 10 years. We haven't mentioned productivity, operational excellence, whatever you'd like to call it on this call, but we work very hard at it. And our global operations team and our CDIY ops team, every year has an absolute table stakes commitment of 3% cost reduction. They usually have a funnel that adds to more than that. But if real prices go down 1% to 2% and margins are 35% and you get a 3% cost reduction, that leads to margin maintenance, and that's how we manage this business, so quarter-to-quarter, we'll have a little more promotional activity that might drive a little more volume at a little lower margin. And that will be a little bit of give and take. But over time, that's how we think about this business. We want to keep it right in that mid-teens level and continue to gain share. And so far, I think the CDIY team in every function has done a commendable job of doing that, and it is a model for the rest of our company in terms of a level we're trying to get to.
Operator: And our last question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Don, I was hoping you could just walk through a little bit on the math of how you think about the cash flows over the next couple of years. I think what you guided to is sort of roughly $1 billion of share repos and then $700 million of debt reduction, and that would seem to pretty much match the free cash flow that you'll generate. But then you have dividends of $600 million or $700 million and then you've got some limitation on the international cash and how you use that. So I just wondered if you can maybe bridge all of that.
Donald Allan: Yes. Well, the -- we went into the year with a debt level of about $300 million that we can actually pay down in commercial paper. And so that's about as much deleveraging as we can do going forward over the next couple of years. So that's kind of the number for debt deleveraging. And then there's, obviously, the dividend numbers you mentioned and then share repurchase as well, and that pretty much uses up the vast majority of our cash well over the next 2 years.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Is that inclusive of calling back international cash?
Donald Allan: There'll be a little bit of that as well, absolutely.
Operator: And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Waybright for closing remarks.
Gregory Waybright: Lorraine, thank you. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation. And please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Just to touch on some of the highlights of the third quarter. Revenues did increase 10%, of which 4% was organic growth. The rest was the addition of Infastech, and it was partially offset by currency. Diluted EPS of $1.39, up 14% versus 3Q '12. Diluted GAAP EPS, including charges, were $1.07. Our growth initiatives that we've talked about the last couple of quarters really continue to deliver some strong results. They contributed about 200 basis points or 2 percentage points of the growth. Both CDIY and our Industrial segments achieved some compelling top lines. Specifically, CDIY achieved organic growth of 5% at a 15% OM rate. And within our Industrial segment, Oil & Gas delivered another really strong quarter of organic growth of 32%. In Security growth, both the growth rate and the margin improved sequentially. Globally, organic growth was 1% versus prior year, driven primarily by our growth investments in the North American verticals and emerging markets, and the OM rate within Security improved 170 basis points sequentially to 12.2%, so good progress. And as a consequence, we see no changes to our expectations for the long-term financial prospects for Security, and we believe the strategy and the programs that are in place to deliver our long-term financial objectives will get where they need to be. But we are revising our full year 2013 guidance -- EPS guidance to a range of $4.90 to $5, as a result -- primarily as a result of the slower margin recovery within Security, weakening in emerging markets and the impact of the U.S. government shutdown on near-term organic growth. So full year EPS, $4.90 to $5 and resulting free cash flow at approximately $800 million. And a lot more detail on those 2 projections and pieces of guidance from Don later on this morning. Let's look briefly at our sources of growth because organic growth remains strong and the momentum is good. In the third quarter, volume was up 5%, bringing it to 3% on a year-to-date basis. Price was down 1%. So organic growth, as previously stated, at 4%. Acquisitions added 7%. Currency detracted by 1%, so a total revenue growth of 10%. Looking at the organic growth year-to-date of 3%. Just it's -- where -- third quarter was not too different from year-to-date. We have a slow first quarter, as you'll recall, very robust second quarter and a healthy third quarter, which was right above the midpoint or slightly above the midpoint of our year-to-date performance. So a little bit bumpy but good organic growth on a year-to-date basis, with third quarter falling between first and second quarter. First quarter, as you'll recall, we had very little traction from our organic growth investments, but they're really starting to produce the kinds of result that we have expected. Looking at the regions. And there is more detail in the appendix, but I think it's important to point out the U.S., our largest market, was up 3% and is up 3% year-to-date. It's still strong but it's not accelerating. Europe was down 1% in total and was down 1% on a year-to-date basis. As I think all of you know, the macro environment is more stable than it has been, but there's still certainly no tailwind and arguably, a headwind. And within Europe, within our businesses, Security was down as, further detailed in our press release, as a combination of organizational changes and moves we're making and the macro environment. CDIY, it continues to gain share, and John Wyatt and the CDIY European team are doing a terrific job driving new distribution and share gains with product innovation and tremendous commercial efforts. Industrial within Europe was down slightly as well in -- pretty much in line with the market. Emerging markets remain a bright spot, up 14% in the third quarter, up 8% on a year-to-date basis. Industrial and CDIY posting strong results. And Security was up nicely in emerging markets but it's from quite a small base, but we're making good progress there on our Security business in emerging markets. And the rest of the world was flat. So again, 4% organic growth on the third quarter, 3% on a year-to-date basis. Just a quick snapshot, and I'll say some anecdotes on the specific initiatives that we've talked about for the last couple of calls. These initiatives are demonstrating results and within the third quarter, the emerging market expansion continues. We've hired about 300 people, including key country leaders and sales positions. Our distributor expansion is progressing nicely, both in the traditional and industrial channels or with that base, as well as in the modern channels in northeast Asia, where those channels are more established. That all helps us prepare for the mid-price-point product launches, which will come later this year. And the ability to launch those essential mid-priced products in emerging markets has been accelerated by 3 to 6 months through the GQ acquisition that Jim spoke to you about on the last call. Finally, the Security verticals are gaining traction. We have order momentum building, and we've had some recent success in our K-12 and Healthcare programs on a global basis, specifically, new access card control systems in 73 schools across the country in the third quarter alone and orders in excess of $1 million at 3 hospitals. Obviously, we don't want to name them without their permission, but just as a demonstration of some meaningful points on the board with some of these initiatives. So as a consequence, we remain on track for our 3-year commitments with the organic growth program. And finally, just a quick look inside emerging markets with some real highlights in our tools businesses: Russia, up 32%; China, 27%; Middle East and Africa, 9%; Latin America, 8%; Southeast Asia, 7%, so total emerging market growth -- tools business growth of 13%. And previously, as I said, Security's growing nicely in emerging markets as well but from a very small base. Let me turn it over to Jim, who's going to take a deeper dive into some of the segments.
James M. Loree: Okay. Thank you, John. Starting with CDIY, another respectable quarter for CDIY, with 5% organic growth and near 15% operating margin. Revenues were $1.388 billion, up 5%. The operating profit was $207 million versus $204 million last year or up 2%. Profit rate was 14.9% versus 15.5% last year, a 60-basis-point decrease, which was largely attributable to the cost of the organic growth investments totaling 40 basis points of impact. Organic growth was solid across virtually every region and every business unit within CDIY. PPT or Professional Power Tools was up 10%, as NPI, emerging market growth, promotions and the recovering U.S. construction market all contributed to the performance. In particular, the brushless XR and the cordless framing nailer, new products, registered significant gains. CPG or consumer products was up 5%, as outdoor continued its strength, while the innovative Matrix power tools gained share in the developed markets and new products in steam and hand vacs performed well in Europe. Emerging markets also contributed significantly to CPG's growth. Hand Tools and Storage was up 3% organically, led by continued growth in DeWalt Hand Tools in the U.S. and positive growth in Europe. As far as the regions, Europe was up 3%, an especially encouraging performance and their best since the euro crisis began, with share gains in a stabilizing economy and an especially strong performance in the U.K. Emerging markets at plus 10% was strong, but about 5 points of growth short of our expectation, as slowing markets, credit issues, currency volatility and in-channel congestion all took their toll. North America was up 4%, but could easily have been up an additional 2 points or so if inventory cautiousness at certain retailers and independents as a whole had not dampened shipments in September. All in all, inventories of the larger retailers are in good shape, with some dispersion across that universe. And POS, in the aggregate, at the large customers remained healthy, so it appears that the consumer demand and construction-related activity have yet to be adversely affected by the U.S. government shutdown. So all in all, CDIY fared reasonably well in the quarter, with somewhat less growth than expected due to the emerging market slowdown and late quarter caution in the U.S. CDIY channels. And now moving to Industrial. Industrial, too, had a respectable quarter, with 4% organic growth despite several headwinds and challenges. Operating margin at 14.5% was solid, down 90 basis points versus 3Q '12, driven primarily by organic growth investments and a slight mix down resulting from the addition of Infastech, which remains on track. Revenues were $771 million, up 25%, and operating profit was $112 million, up 18%. Infrastructure, once again, was the star of the quarter with 23% organic growth, fueled by a 32% increase, as John mentioned, in Oil & Gas. Organic revenues and a high-margin onshore automatic welding activity drove the revenue growth in both the U.S. and the rest of the world. Industrial & Auto Repair delivered 2% growth in the face of several headwinds, including a virtual no-show for a normal 3Q U.S. government spending, as well as Europe being down in the mid-single digits as SAP was implemented there and their major industry trade show will occur in the fourth quarter this year versus the third quarter of last year. Without these 2 discontinuities, IAR Europe would have been modestly positive. Mac Tools grew in the high-single digits, providing some offset. However, IAR's positive growth can be traced to the organic growth initiatives, with emerging markets up 13% and smart tools and storage collectively contributing about 3 points of growth. Engineered Fastening had what appeared to be an uncharacteristically weak organic growth performance, being flat. However, underlying that story was a very difficult equipment sales comp from last year's third quarter, which resulted in equipment sales down 23%, and that was offset by fasteners up a more normal 6% organically, about 2x global light vehicle production. So the story for Industrial this quarter was a solid performance in the face of several material, but mostly temporary, headwinds. And now I will focus on Security for a few minutes. Security is one of the drivers behind the recalibration of our outlook, with a general theme of progress but not at the pace that was expected. However, there is a definite distinction between the North America/emerging markets piece and Security Europe, with the former showing good growth and OM rates nearing but not at normalized levels and the latter taking more time to achieve desired growth and thus, profitability levels. I will delve into each one of these stories, but first, a quick overview of the segment. Revenues were $600 million, up 3%. Organic sales were up 1%. Operating profit was $73 million, down 22%, and the OM rate was 12.2% versus 16% a year ago, but, importantly, up sequentially from 10.5% in 2Q. And this represents 170-basis-point improvement, which is moving in the right direction but just not at a fast-enough pace. Now when we turn to the 2 pieces, starting with North America, you begin to see a reasonably positive story, with the business returning to a healthier state. And there, you can see 4% organic growth in North America/emerging markets and sequential rate improvement of 180 basis points from 13.3% to 15.1%. And without the investment in the growth initiatives or adjusting for that, the operating margin rate would have been in the mid-16s. So the organic growth, pretty positive story there, really resulting from several factors, some of which John touched on: the vertical market initiative definitely gaining traction, particularly in health care, education, also, in financial services. The automatic doors business was robust, with mid-single-digit growth. We had strong product introductions across the businesses, had a really outstanding ASIS show, which is the industry show in Chicago in September, where we showcased new products across the businesses. They were very well received by our customers, as well as our vertical solutions. And as we mentioned earlier, the emerging markets are also contributing. So the sequential OM rate improvement on top of the growth is promising. Several key drivers for that: the vertical market mix as these systems are at above line average profitability; some improvements in field efficiency, not as much as we were looking for, but definite improvements in efficiency in North America; and then the commercial lock transition in the Mechanical Access business, now 9 months into the transition, entering a phase where the OM rates are now improving. So North America and emerging markets, about 60% of the segment is returning to a healthier state and will continue to make progress in 4Q and beyond. And then when we focus on Europe, turning the page, the other 40% of the segment, we see a situation where organic growth is still elusive and negative, which, in turn, is slowing the sequential rate improvement and slowing our ability to get the operating margin rates back up into that zone that we're looking for. And the reality here is that the shortfalls in organic growth have gone beyond the 2-year shortfalls that we were expecting when we closed Niscayah, and they're now cutting into the margin rates. And we haven't had much help from the macro environment, although, frankly, we didn't expect much, and it is stabilizing. So we are dealing with several structural issues, the first being historical overdependence on referrals from the mother company, Securitas, that really referred a lot of business to Niscayah back in the days when they were affiliated. So we had to rebuild the sales force almost from scratch over the last 2 years. And then we had, in various countries, weak legacy management that we had to undertake significant management replacements and changes. And then finally, we had a legacy systems integration model mindset and business model at Niscayah versus a recurring revenue model, which is what we're familiar with in North America. And then there is just the pace of change in Europe in general, which is a challenge. And so these are all significant challenges, some of which we expected, some of which were deeper than expected. But we have a strong and capable management team in place in our Brussels headquarters for Security Europe, and although the progress is slower than desired, real progress has been made. As I mentioned, the sales force rebuild is well underway, and the France and U.K. and even southern Europe elements of this business are now performing quite well. In Nordics and Germany, Nordics being the largest region, which, fortunately for us, both decent economic environments over there, are really more self-inflicted works in progress, and we just made a significant management change, leadership change in the Nordics. And so most of the management upgrades are complete at this point in time. And we're gradually moving the model now towards a recurring revenue base model. So we should continue to see progress here in Europe, but we are not going to overcommit the pace of change at this point. I'll now turn it over to Don Allan, who will cover the financial aspects of the quarter.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. So I'd like to start with a walk through working capital and then move into cash flow. So our working capital performance was flat versus the prior year at 5.9 working capital turns, which was slightly off expectation. We expected to improve our working capital turns by about 0.4 turn in the third quarter of this year. Let me walk through a couple of the specific reasons for that variation. The first of which is that when you look at our receivables or DSO, the expectation was is that we'd be closer to a flat performance versus the prior year, but given the timing of how the revenue occurred within the third quarter, it actually drove an increase in our DSO of about 5%. We view that as a temporary situation and don't see that as a major hurdle for our objectives related to working capital and cash flow for 2013. Second area is inventory, DSI which was flat. We did expect our DSI actually to improve in the third quarter, but due to the lower organic revenue performance in certain businesses in this third quarter versus our expectation, it caused some inventory pressure in our supply chain. And then the fourth area is the payables or DPO, which improved by 9%, and this is an area that we continue to demonstrate improvement over the last several years. This is really where the impact of the Stanley Fulfillment System and the hard work of our supply chain teams continues to demonstrate the benefits that the Stanley Fulfillment System can have on working capital as we continue to accelerate our progress there. The end result was 5.9 working capital turn, as I mentioned, which was about 0.4 below our expectation. The vast majority of that was the combination of inventory and receivables. Our expectation for the end of the year is that we will be closer to a flat performance versus 2012 at 7.5 working capital turns versus our original expectation which was a modest improvement over 2012. And I'll walk through that in a little more detail on the next page. But our expectation is that we still believe, with all these things that we're doing through the Stanley Fulfillment System, that we can continue to work our way towards our goal of 10 working capital turns. So moving to free cash flow. You can see the significant impact of working capital in the third quarter, which was a cash outflow of $244 million and year-to-date, cash outflow of $372 million. The good news is the expectation is, given the way that our fourth quarter works and the seasonality of several of our businesses, specifically the CDIY business, where a large portion of the revenue occurs in October and November, we believe, given that, that we can reverse the vast majority of this negative by the end of the year. However, instead of it being a slight modest positive versus our original expectation, we expect it to be flat or even a slight small negative at the end of the year. The reasons I walked through on the previous page. The Other area -- Other category made some modest improvement. If you remember, back in July, I talked about some negatives that occurred in other that were more timing issues. We saw some of that reverse itself in the third quarter, and that trend will continue in the fourth quarter as that becomes more in line with our expectations by the end of the year. So the question some of you might be asking is, "What's the roadmap from where we are to $800 million in free cash flow?" Well, if we start with our original expectation of $1 billion back in July, there's really 2 drivers that reduced it to $800 million. The first is our working capital expectation has dropped by about $100 million, and you'll hear on the guidance section and right after this that our earnings expectation is $100 million lower as well. Those are the 2 main drivers versus prior guidance. But where we are today, at $150 million roughly of free cash flow, what is the path that gets us to $800 million? Well, our fourth quarter would have approximately net income and D&A of about $310 million based on current outlook. The working capital reversal of roughly $372 million, as you see up above, and then Other continuing to improve by about $50 million and then CapEx of about $80 million to $90 million would get you to roughly $800 million of free cash flow for the year. And that would be the roadmap to that expectation. So with that, I'd like to turn to our revised outlook for 2013. Our current view of organic growth for the year is that we expect it to approximate 3%. We're year-to-date, through 9 months, at right around 3%, which means the fourth quarter is expected to be a similar number, versus our prior expectation of 4% to 5%. And I'll walk through some of the details of that in a few minutes. What that means to our EPS is that, combined with Security's slower recovery, we believe that EPS can be $4.90 to $5 this year versus our previous expectation. So let's walk through some of the details of that. About half of the EPS reduction relates to a slower-than-expected pace of Security margin improvement versus our expectation in July. Jim did a great job walking through the detail of that a few minutes ago, so I'm sure you can understand the aspects of that in more detail. The second portion of it is related to a reduced view of organic growth, that I previously mentioned a few minutes ago, of now 3% for the year. And there's really a couple of drivers to that. We believe that with the pressure that we're seeing in emerging markets, it's -- which is a slight temporary deceleration, we believe, associated with some of the macroeconomic environment pressures we're seeing in those geographies around the world will contribute to this. And then two, we really believe the U.S. government sequestration and shutdown has had a modest impact in Q3 on us and will have a slightly more significant impact in us in Q4. The good news is we believe these issues are temporary, that they're not issues that will carry over into 2014. But we cannot guarantee that at this point, so our view is to be prudent about where we are today and focus on what we can achieve through our growth initiatives and other organic initiatives across the company. The last thing I'd say is that partially offsetting this pressure is an improved tax rate. As you saw in the third quarter, we did have some accelerated tax credits, as well as a shift in the distribution of our earnings across the world that allowed a lower tax rate. We expect that to carry through for the year. And now our tax rate will be 20% versus the 23% expectation in July. The last thing I'd say associated with guidance is that, when you think through where we were in July, we were at a situation where we felt we were beginning to accelerate organic growth. As we close Q2, we saw accelerating organic growth in many areas, emerging markets, the U.S. and even Europe continuing to slightly improve. Our second quarter organic growth was 5%. Our second half view was organic growth slightly above 6%. Now, we see some deceleration in the -- with the second half being closer to 3% to 4% organic growth versus that 6% number. The second area, which is a change is really our slower recovery in Security. We believe we're doing all the right things in Security to get this business back to historical levels. But in the case of Europe, it's going to take a little longer than our original expectation, but we're hitting all the right areas to make sure we achieve that in 2014 and beyond. There's a little bit of segment detail associated with our guidance to the right. I'll touch on a few things very briefly, and then you can have follow-up questions as you see appropriate. CDIY will still be a mid-single-digit organic revenue performance for 2013, although slightly lower than original expectations due to the emerging market growth expectation being slightly muted. The modest OM rate increase is still expected to occur for the segment versus 2012. Security's organic revenue is expected to be a modest decline versus 2012. And we'll continue to see modest growth in North America, which will be offset by the continued mid-single-digit decline that we've been seeing in Europe. The operating margin rate will decrease year-over-year based on the information that Jim provided a few minutes ago. And then Industrial will continue to be a low- to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth expectation for 2013, slightly lower than our expectation in July due to the emerging market situation, as well as the uncertain government situation here in the United States. And then the OM rate is expected to decrease slightly, mainly due to the initial Infastech margins being slightly below line average, as well as the impact of some of the growth investments. The last thing I'd say on this page is that our view for 2014 is still being developed. But we still believe that many of the things that we're seeing here are temporary around the pressures in organic growth and that our long-term objective of 4% to 6% organic growth is achievable in 2014. Along with that, we believe that we can grow our EPS year-over-year 7% to 9% associated with that. Obviously, those numbers are excluding charges. So to summarize the presentation portion of the call this morning, we believe 2013 is continuing to demonstrate traction in organic growth, even though we are seeing some pressures in certain areas that I just touched on. We continue to focus on the organic growth initiatives. They drove half of our 4% organic growth in the third quarter, and we're definitely seeing the benefit of them. CDIY and Industrial had a solid performance in the third quarter, and we continue to see positive momentum in those businesses. We've recalibrated our Security margin performance. The expectation is below -- or is below expectations but it's progressing. And we really believe that we will regain position in this business as being a revenue and earnings grower and a driver for our performance in 2014 and beyond. The emerging market macro environment is difficult, and the U.S. government situation is creating some uncertainty for us, but we're still demonstrating solid organic growth even with that. Our 2013 outlook has been revised for the items that I mentioned, and we remain focused on driving organic growth in our company, the efficiencies across the company, trying to maximize synergies and then allocating our capital in a way that provides excellent returns for our shareholders. So that concludes the presentation portion of the call, and we'll move to Q&A.
Gregory Waybright: Yes, great. Thanks, Don. Dawn, we can now open the call to Q&A, please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Feldman from UBS.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Last couple of years, I know have certainly been challenging from a macro perspective, in currency and a lot of acquisitions and divestitures. But when I look at your revised guidance for this year, it's actually very similar to the initial guidance you gave for 2011, 2 years ago. When you look back kind of over the last 3 years, what do you think, over that period, kind of drove the shortfall versus your expectations? Do you see any kind of structural issue with the 3 segments that you have? Was it execution? Was it M&A? Or was it really just end markets and macro?
Donald Allan: Jason, it's Don. When I look back at the last 3 years, there's things that have happened in that time frame, and obviously, we've had shifts in the portfolio. We've sold businesses such as HHI. We've had acquisitions that have kind of shape-shift the structure of the company in that time frame. In 2011, the performance, in my view, was pretty solid and achieved our objectives for that year. In 2012, we had some dynamics in Europe that were difficult that hit every company, not just ours, in the second quarter and the third quarter of that year, and we think we responded accordingly with appropriate actions. And then the acquisition of Niscayah certainly had an impact on us here in 2013, and Jim walked through that in a lot of detail, and we're responding accordingly to it. We feel like we've taken the actions to get the business back on track here in '13, so it can be -- get itself closer to historical levels as we enter '14 and move further into 2014. But my view is there's not something structurally wrong with the portfolio of the company or structurally wrong with other aspects of the company. I think it's more due to the continued portfolio transformation of our company and driving performance and trying to maximize shareholder value along the way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So just 1 question. So you're guiding for 2, 3 points of sequential margin improvements at Security in 3Q, and you've got within that range. And it sounds like your implied guidance suggests there's no further improvement in 4Q. So can you just maybe just confirm that and just give us some color in terms of what's changed in the last 3 months?
John F. Lundgren: Yes. Nigel, it's John. I'll confirm there is no implied guidance despite your calculations for the fourth quarter. That being said, nothing has changed other than, I think Jim did as detailed a job as could possibly be done on this call, that we're pleased with the direction of Security. We are not pleased with the pace. I think the other very important point is the situations in the U.S. and Europe are dramatically different. Europe, we are in the midst of meaningful organizational changes, and those take time. That does take time to, I'll say, put points on the board and have you realize the results. And as I think Jim pointed out pretty clearly, we've got a lot of things going on in the U.S. on the Mechanical side. We've talked about our business model change which -- to a distribution versus direct, which is going to help with volume but, short term, have an impact on margins. I think that's quite clear. And on the Convergent side -- access is making great progress. And on the Convergent side, we've also -- we've talked about the need to focus or refocus on more recurring revenue and less systems integration and installation, which was, I don't want to say a trap but which was a tack we found ourselves going down that's not consistent with our long-term strategy. So a lot of things going on, but there was no implied guidance for the fourth quarter as it relates to margins. My expectation is we'll continue to improve globally, the question is at what pace.
Donald Allan: Yes. The only thing I would do to clarify what Nigel said is that we certainly gave an indication of the sequential improvement back in July, with the expectation in Q3 being a much higher number than what you said, Nigel, which was we expected it to improve about 300 to 350 basis points, and it improved 170 so about halfway there, and then by the fourth quarter, get to historic -- closer to historical level. So if there was a "implied guidance" that was really what it was.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.
Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just a question -- I know 2014 is in flux a bit, but when you look at that 7% to 9% EPS growth and you're saying 4% to 6% organic revenue growth, it seems like you should be able to get much better leverage on that organic revenue growth than what you're implying in that EPS growth for '14. What are kind of the drivers of the deleveraging or the reduced leverage on the volume growth that could potentially occur next year? I'm just trying to square that.
James M. Loree: Yes. I would say that -- this is Jim. I would say that the single biggest aspect of that is a hedge because the government is shut down, business confidence is shaky right now in the U.S. We don't know what the consumer is going to do. So we're putting 4% to 6% out there because the assumption is if the economy kind of stays at the current level, then we should be able to generate 4% to 6%. If that 4% to 6% does not materialize, we still think that we're in a situation where we'll be able to generate some meaningful earnings growth in the range that Don mentioned. However, it will require some more cost cutting and perhaps, some deferral of investments and that type of thing. And we're just at an early stage here, and we can't really determine what the external environment is going to bring with it. So hold on for a couple of months and come January, we'll be talking about that in more detail. Hopefully, the U.S. government will be back in business and business confidence and consumer confidence will be moving in the right direction again.
Donald Allan: Yes. And I would add that we're really just looking to give folks an indication that we saw the potential for growth next year, both top line and EPS growth. So it wasn't necessarily to say that this is a locked-in number and the view of exactly what it's going to be, but I think the way that Jim articulated is an excellent summary.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I've covered Stanley for a long time, and historically, at least, there's been a clear pattern of anytime there's been weakening business conditions and/or executional issues, you've also announced further restructuring actions in order to rightsize the organizational cost structure and offset the earnings shortfall in short order. And notably, I'm not seeing that sort of new restructuring announcement today, which seems really curious given the scale of the current shortfall. So how should we read that as it really -- it seems like it's a significant departure from historical management actions at Stanley, not to announce a restructuring at the same time when there's a material miss?
Donald Allan: Sam, it's Don. The way I would respond to that is I certainly understand that perspective, and I think we are very -- as you know, very active in managing our company and responding quickly to situations. The current situation, though, our view is that it is temporary and to some extent, we believe, unorganic growth. Now we do have some situations related to Security that it's taking a little longer for us to recover, but frankly, we're taking all the restructuring actions we can take in our Security business to make sure that, that gets back on track. And it would be difficult to do a lot more beyond what we've already done, especially given that we're talking about a European business, where it takes time to do these types of restructurings and they can't be done overnight. But going back to the organic growth point of view is that we believe that we're seeing a bit of a deceleration, as I mentioned, here, and it's not the right time to react by a dramatic cost takeout. But to what Jim was saying earlier, if we get into 2014 and we start to see this trend continue, because it's more issues related to the U.S. government or there's some other type of economic impact either associated with that or independent of that, then we will have to take those types of actions. And I am convinced that we'll do that because this leadership team knows how to respond to those types of difficult situations.
James M. Loree: And if you look at where we are in the cycle, to kind of reiterate Don's point about this, we think this is temporary. If you look at where we are in the cycle, you have a construction market in resi which is pretty hot here in the U.S. You have a non-resi market that looks like it's going to be pretty hot in '14. You have Europe, which is stabilizing, not out of the woods, but certainly not a big negative like it has been for -- from an economic point of view. And you have the emerging markets, which are slower, but still 2 to 3x times the growth of the developed markets. So when you look at the macro backdrop, you say, "Well, this is not a permanent problem." It's a bit of a deceleration right now, and in particular, our emerging market activities performing in the low teens pretty impressive, I think, performance under the circumstances. Our issue is that to sustain a mid- to high-teens performance in markets that are decelerating would only put us in a position where we'd be getting into a trap or the channels would get too full. So we're throttling back temporarily. And next year, we have a significant MPP, mid-priced-point, growth program that John referenced. That's going to help us in the emerging markets. So we look around and we say, "The environment is not terribly negative right now. In fact, there's more positives than negatives." Therefore, we're cautiously optimistic that '14 will be a good growth year. There's no point in going and taking a business that has great organic growth momentum, in general, and going to take a hatchet out and take a big chunk of costs out because we're trying to make up for a couple of -- $0.50 of EPS this year. So that is the backdrop. And as I said, we'll have another look in early '14, and we'll share with you our view. And we haven't lost our ability or our inclination to cut costs when the revenue isn't going to be there. But we think, based on everything we see at this point, that the environment could be relatively favorable in '14.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Research: It looks like in terms of the Security margins, without knowing how much you're spending in terms of the growth investments and the restructuring that you're doing with Niscayah, it's hard for us to model that out. But in a similar fashion, in terms of getting to your growth investment targets of the 35% gross margins and somewhat robust operating profits by 2015, can you provide us some more clarity in terms of what gets the gross margins up from where they are currently and what sort of leads to that margin ramp over the next 2 years?
Donald Allan: Yes, Mike. I would say -- well, first of all, the gross margins are not a major drag related to these initiatives here in 2013, and they won't be in 2014. The drag tends to be more at the operating margin rate level, which is where we're making the SG&A investments and the feet on the street in, streets in the emerging markets. Some of the enhanced resources and investments we've made around vertical solutions in the Security business here in North America, those are all SG&A-related costs, so the drag is more at the operating margin rate level. Now as we get into 2014, we'll be embarking on our mid-price-point product launch in the emerging markets, which our expectation is that will be reasonably close to line average gross margin and should not be a drag in that area in 2014. So our view is that we continue to make these SG&A investments. It's more about a volume leverage, getting the volume up to the right level. So the SG&A is giving -- the investments we're making is giving us a return that's in excess of 15% OM.
Operator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: Jim, you talked about throttling back a little bit on the emerging markets business. You're at low teens now. Can you just talk about the profitability as it stands today on the emerging markets business? You've talked in the past of it being 20% or better margins. I'm just wondering how it should go in the quarter and your thoughts for the next couple of quarters.
James M. Loree: Well, there hasn't been any significant change in the profitability levels of emerging markets, with the exception of the fact that the SG&A investments are a bit higher. So that's probably costing us 200 basis points of operating margin or something in that order. So instead of 20%, we're probably closer to 17%, 18%, but it's still above line average profitability.
Operator: We have Stephen Kim from Barclays on the line.
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just wanted to ask you a question, I guess, about the Security business, in particular any lessons you think that are applicable as you sort of look into future opportunities. You cited the fact that there were some sales relationships and then maybe a sales force there that wasn't exactly up to your expectations, relationships with the parent company that were, I guess, losing some of the reported results beyond your expectations. As you look in the rearview mirror and you're trying to assess the lessons you learned from this and you apply that forward, what would you think you might do differently as you assess future M&A opportunities?
John F. Lundgren: Steve, great, great, great question. And maybe there's a spot for you on our Board of Directors because we've had the same conversation with them, and I mean that very, very seriously. I'll give you the short answer, and then I'll add some color because I think it's a really, really important thing to understand. The answer is nothing. And the different -- I would argue that Stanley Black & Decker has a core competency rapidly developing, if not already recognized, for acquiring, integrating, improving the performance of the business. And even in the past, when it's been suggested we've acquired at a very high price relative to our trading multiples, within a year or 2, it looked brilliant. In the case of Niscayah, there was one really, really important distinction. It was a contested publicly-traded company, where the former parent tried to buy it. We had the opportunity to intervene as a white knight, for lack of better terminology. It was a business we knew strategically was a very important fit. We had tried to buy that business when it was part of Securitas. That being said, Jim, myself, the Security team did a lot of due diligence to the extent we could 3 or 4 years prior. We had the opportunity -- we did not have the opportunity to do the kind of due diligence that we do, so we hit the ground running Day 1, where we know what the organization looks like, we know what the projections are, we're really comfortable with the synergies. We used our best estimates. That being said, what did we get right and what did we miss? And I think you asked that. We knew that the senior management was not there for the long haul because it was a newly upgraded -- newly created public company. They had no desire to carry on and weren't a good fit with our organization and they left. We underestimated the degree to which the field sales organization and the field tech organization in both countries needed to be upgraded. That took some time. I think it's well in process. But as we've suggested earlier, we depleted some of our existing Security business' bench, and we've put some very capable resources, including Massimo Grassi, one of our most tested and proven European leaders, added him to our Security business team in an effort to drive the changes that needed to be made. And I think the other thing Jim mentioned that we missed and I don't think without proper full due diligence in hindsight -- with the guide of 20/20 hindsight, it's easy. But we underestimated the degree to which the Niscayah business allowed on referrals from Securitas to maintain their installed base and as a consequence, turn that into recurring revenue. So all those things that Jim touched on are real. We've sat back and asked ourselves the hard question. Would we -- could we have anticipated that ahead of time? And the honest answer is, we think, no. To answer the last part of your question, were it to be a publicly-traded company and we were having -- we had the opportunity to intervene because we've never made a hostile acquisition in our career. It's not our style, and that tends to not work out very well. We might try to ask more questions, do more research. But understand, we had 2 weeks to mobilize to do this deal or not. I think 2 years from now, because we're asking ourselves the question now, "Would we have made the acquisition if we had to do it over again?" The answer is absolutely yes. Are we enduring some short-term pain for long-term gain? The answer is yes. And it's a long answer to a simple question, but it's appropriate that -- we've had this question internally, and we've had the discussion with our board. And I think that's exactly where we come out.
James M. Loree: Yes. And I'll just add to it that when we did this deal, we knew there were a lot of unknowns, and we knew the environment in Europe was uncertain, although we were not in the midst of a euro crisis. And so we've put pretty significant hedges in the plan. There was a $100 million revenue hedge as an example. We assumed we would lose $100 million of revenue. That would have been sufficient to cover the Securitas issues and some of the other things John was talking about, but it wasn't sufficient to cover the euro crisis and that at the same time, so not a big enough hedge, a very large hedge. We outperformed the cost synergies, and we continue to outperform the cost synergies on this deal, as well. And we knew that was a conservative estimate of the cost synergies that we undertook when we announced the deal. And the hedges just weren't big enough based on a combined euro crisis and some of the internal structural issues at the same time.
John F. Lundgren: And last point, Steve, it kind of relates to Sam Darkatsh's question on restructuring, which I think Don answered quite well. We haven't forgotten how to do it. We do it when we need to. We've made over 50 acquisitions in the last 10 years. We haven't gotten them all perfect on Day 1. There are very few that after we've owned them for a reasonable period of time, we haven't fixed them or figured out what's wrong with them and dramatically restructured them or changed them. And I personally am confident that we'll get there with Niscayah. It's going to take longer for all the reasons you've identified. They're all completely accurate. There all with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, and that's where we stand on it. And then I'm hoping within -- a year or so from now, we'll be able to say we told you so. You asked the right questions, and we had the right programs in place, but spot on for now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Lisnic from Robert Baird.
Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: This is Josh Chan filling in for Pete. Just on the idea of possible deceleration, I know, Jim, you've talked a little bit about some slowing in September in CDIY. I was just wondering if September was just a slow month in general across your different kind of businesses. I was wondering if you have any color on that.
James M. Loree: Well, September was a slow month in Industrial & Automotive Repair for sure, with the government basically shut down. And there's usually a surge in September related to the government spending and so forth that just didn't occur, so that was clear. We think that there were some inventory corrections, as I mentioned, at retail, which was definitely a factor in CDIY. And then we also had the systems implementation in IAR, as well as the Kip [ph] Auto Show, which is the trade show which would occur in the fourth quarter and not September as in previous -- as in the previous years. So these factors all contributed to a slow September. It was a very slow September in relation to what we expected and what we've been experiencing on a run rate basis. And that's why a fair amount of the deceleration is attributable to both the emerging market slowdown and the U.S. government issues that we have right now with respect to the budget funding levels.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes. Just wanted to focus on North America also for a bit. If you could go into more detail with regards to, I guess, what you would call some of the areas that you are happy with and that you still expect some additional improvement in, particularly in Security. You had mentioned on the -- where you felt room to go is on the field efficiency side, for example. And also in the CDIY, where you'd mentioned the inventory reductions, if it's possible, can you give any additional clarity there, if you think that will continue into the fourth quarter, for example?
John F. Lundgren: Yes. I can't give too much more clarity on the inventory reductions other than to say that what we're -- I said there was some disparity across the population or the universe of these customers, and we would never call out any one in -- specifically. But what I will say is that there is a pattern where the retailers that are performing well are not necessarily adjusting inventories. Their inventories are in pretty good shape. And the retailers that are struggling a bit are in a different place, so their inventories are getting a little bit out of line. On the average, the inventories are in good shape. So -- but you do have a little bit of a dispersion across the universe. And on Security, their -- the fourth -- the third quarter performance in terms of margin probably fell about 200 basis points or so short of where we had hoped it would be, and a good half of that is related to the field efficiency. So we did make improvements, but there definitely are some areas in the area of efficiency that are improving even as we speak on a month-to-month basis, but just not improving on a fast-enough rate. And we have good visibility into that, and we should see some improvements continue into the fourth quarter on that front. And then, in general, what I'm very happy about in North America is the organic growth. We really haven't -- we've made a lot -- talked a lot about it, but I defy anybody to go back and find out when the last time CSS organic growth was at that level in North America. So we've been talking for a long, long time about Security ultimately becoming a growth engine -- organic growth engine for the company. The vertical market solutions is the way to do that. It's a terrific, terrific business because it has a defensible value proposition. It has above line average margins, and you can grow it. It's not like the basic monitoring business, which is the more you install, the lower your margins go until you get the recurring revenue built up. It doesn't have that dynamic, so it helps us deal with that. Very excited about the growth in North America Security.
Operator: Our next question comes from Liam Burke from Janney Capital Markets.
Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: You'd had -- Engineered Fastening, you had a tough comp in terms of the systems orders year-over-year. It did affect your operating margins for the quarter. Looking at current order rates, how do you see that business trending for the balance of the year and into '14, both on the systems side and on the margins?
Donald Allan: Well, this is Don. The portion of the business that we're referring to is the legacy Engineered Fastening business, which is tied more to light vehicle production globally. And as Jim mentioned, the fastener piece of the business outperformed light vehicle production growth in the third quarter and has done that over ...
James M. Loree: 2:1.
Donald Allan: 2:1 and has done that for quite some time. But we did, in the third quarter of last year, have a significant equipment -- set of equipment sales that occurred in our European business. That was a difficult comp for them in the third quarter. But our view going forward is that we believe that, that performance versus light vehicle production will continue to be strong and healthy. And they have been very focused on gaining market share over -- well, that's certainly part of their differentiation model over the long term. But in the last 2 years, they've really been able to demonstrate that in the financials, and we believe they will be able to continue to do that at a significant pace. And when you look at the Infastech business, which is more significantly tied to the electronics industry, we believe that we're doing similar things there around differentiation that allow this business to continue to demonstrate mid-single-digit growth going forward over the long term.
Operator: We have Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Just quickly, Jim, on the '14 numbers and the puts and takes. I can appreciate risks from the government side and kind of the uncertainty, but I would think that would flow through the revenue outlook as well. But for a given 4% to 6% increase and realizing you'll be anniversary-ing some of the brand investment or the strategic growth investments, you'll have lapped a lot of the problems in Security, it would seem like the incremental growth should be a lot stronger for that given level of 4% to 6%. So is there something else within the margin structure that would be offsets to that?
James M. Loree: There's nothing structural at all. I mean I think Don, as he said earlier, put that numbers -- those numbers out there because he wanted people to understand that we expect positive growth in 2014 no matter what the environment looks like, based on the government shutdown, et cetera. The -- so for you to conclude that if anything beyond that would be wrong -- and the 4% to 6% growth is a number that, as I said earlier, I think we can make if the economy is kind of more the same that we've had this year, for the most part, and the organic growth initiatives will buttress that number up against kind of a normalized economy that we're having this -- that we have in the first half this year and, hopefully, we'll have in '14. So it's just as I said earlier, there is a pretty substantial hedge in that number, and if the volume doesn't come through, we still expect to be able to deliver growth of that magnitude at the earnings line.
John F. Lundgren: Dennis, it's John. Let me just add a little perspective that I think will help you, but I think Jim and Don described it perfectly accurately. This is -- it's available on the public domain. It's in our proxy. And a lot of it reflects on how we compensate in an effort to motivate our organization, and the overwhelming majority of the organization is compensated based on 3 metrics: organic growth, earnings and cash flow and/or working capital turns, if you're in a business. And we want the organic growth number to be more of a stretch than the earnings number for all the reasons Jim and Don talked about. But all 3 of those metrics are important. That's how we measure our people, that's how we measure ourselves, that's how we pay our people. But I think it's important to note that earnings per share or operating margin depend on where you sit in the company. Cash flow and working capital turns are weighted slightly higher than the organic growth. We've had a lot of conversations about that internally with our comp committee, with our folks, and we think it's the right weighting. So yes, don't jump to any conclusions based on that. But I've -- hopefully, what I just walked you through will help you understand it.
Operator: We have Andy Noorigian from Vertical Research.
Andrew Noorigian - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: And just really quick, I think on the CDIY, you've mentioned emerging market channel congestion. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what exactly that was. And as you look to '14, with the medium price point rollout, are the channels all in place for that as you look out? Or is there more investments to be made there?
James M. Loree: The channel congestion that I referred to simply relates to the fact that almost all business in the emerging markets is done through distribution, independent distribution. We have done a lot of developing distribution this year, and in doing so, we have sold a lot of tools to these distributors, who are now in the process of marketing these tools to end users. And we are in the process of creating end-user poll and end-user demand, and it's a natural process that you go through when you develop distributors. When you look at the markets, just to be clear, these markets are not growing at the pace that we're growing in the emerging markets. So our growth is coming from the development of distribution, as well as share gains that are with the existing distributors. And so part of the deceleration is driving a slower growth outlook because we certainly are not going to fill the channels to the point where it becomes an issue for the end distributors from a liquidity perspective or just it doesn't make business sense. So we're being prudent in not pushing too hard until the pool is sufficient at the end-user level, so the channels are operating smoothly.
Operator: That was our last question. I will now turn the call back to Greg Waybright for closing comments.
Gregory Waybright: Dawn, thanks. And we'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning. Please contact me if you have any further questions. And again, thanks for your participation.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q2 2013 Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. You may begin.
Gregory Waybright: Thank you, Christine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR portion of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. This replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's 2013 second quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] And obviously, please feel free to call me with any follow-up questions after today's call. And finally, as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Second quarter highlights certainly included 12% revenue growth due to a combination of 5% organic growth, with which we were very pleased, and the other 7%, the addition of Infastech. Diluted EPS of $1.21 a share were up 7%, and diluted GAAP EPS was actually $1.23. And the press release, if you've had a chance to look at it, explains, I would say, the counterintuitive nuance of GAAP earnings being higher than -- higher due to the reversal of an accrual. And if anyone needs more information, Don can get you that offline or during the Q&A. The organic growth initiatives, which we've talked about on the last 3 calls, are accelerating, particularly in the emerging markets. Our CDIY business and Industrial businesses both had compelling top line results, as well as margin growth. CDIY organic growth of 6% and an operating margin, x charges, of above 15%. And Engineered Fastening grew 9%. That's well ahead of its core market -- core automotive market around the globe. And in the discussion of the segments, Jim will talk a little bit about the penetration -- increased penetration and resulting share gains that we're experiencing in that business. Security, globally, organic revenue was down 1% due primarily to the Convergent Security Solutions volume declines in Europe, and that was partially offset by organic growth in both our Commercial Hardware and Access Technologies, our automatic doors business. The bright spot is orders increased significantly in both North America and Europe as the quarter wound down. In volume, Niscayah synergies and platform growth investments are expected to lead to margin recovery for Security in the second half. More about that at the end of our brief presentation from Don when he discusses the outlook. But as a consequence, we are maintaining full year guidance as our increased organic growth expectations we expect to offset the significant headwinds that we are facing from foreign exchange in selected markets. Looking briefly at the sources of growth. Sequentially, volume, as mentioned, was up 6%; price was down 1%, leading to, on a global basis, 5% organic growth. Acquisitions, primarily Infastech, added 7%. In the quarter, the impact of FX was flat, leading to our up 12% revenue growth versus up 3% in the same period a year ago. In the regions, we were quite encouraged. U.S., in total, up 6%; Europe, 2%; emerging markets, 12%; and the rest of the world, the details of which are in the appendix, was primarily Canada and Japan were down low-single digits, while Australia, New Zealand were flat. The rest of the world was about down 2% as a combined group of countries, for the total of 5% in terms of organic growth. So the momentum from our growth initiatives continues to build. But let me talk about those for just a second before we get into the segments. We have hired 450 people, feet on the street, primarily sales folks, primarily in emerging markets, to drive the growth that we've talked to you about on our last 2 or 3 calls. We've also completed the acquisition of GQ, the #3 Chinese power tool company and a significant move for us in that it allows us to expand our mid price point footprint in the Asian market in particular, emerging markets in general. And we remain on track to our 3-year commitment from our project leapfrog [ph], our organic growth initiative, for $850 million of incremental revenue and $200 million of incremental operating margin. Again, as we've highlighted, this is something that we track rigorously, regularly, with the same, I'll say, intensity and metrics that we would track a large acquisition integration. So we feel, at this stage, quite comfortable with those numbers. Looking at the emerging market and the impact that -- the emerging markets and the impact the growth initiative has had, really, really strong quarter: Russia, up 31%; China, 24%; Southeast Asia, 13%; Middle East, Africa, 15%; Latin America, up 15%. Very, very strong performance. And as a consequence, per the press release, we're now expecting those initiatives to contribute 2 percentage points or 200 basis points of incremental growth for the year versus the 100 basis points which was our previous forecast as these programs begin to gain traction and really put some points on the board. Let me turn it over to Jim, who's going to quickly walk you through some of the highlights from our 3 segments.
James M. Loree: Okay. Thank you, John. Once again, CDIY had a terrific quarter. Strong execution across the globe, coupled with improving U.S. residential Construction & DIY markets, produced excellent results: revenues of $1.446 billion, up $115 million or 9%; segment profit was $219 million, up $11 million or 5%; and organic growth was 6% in total, with Professional Power Tools up 13%; the Consumer Products Group up 3%; and Hand Tools and Storage up 5%. The operating margin rate was 15.1%, down slightly 50 basis points from a year ago, reflecting strong impact of the growth initiatives, as well as strong promotional activity in the U.S. Professional Power Tools benefited, from a growth perspective, from those promotions, as well as new product introductions and emerging market gains. The consumer group benefited from outdoor growth, which was a turnaround from the first quarter, when we had some weather issues, a global steam product introduction and strength in the emerging markets. And Hand Tools and Storage gain -- experienced gains from the Black & Decker revenue synergies specifically associated with DeWalt and the continued rollout of last year's program at Stafta [ph], as well as a major U.S. home center. In addition, this quarter, we began a rollout of DeWalt mechanics tools at a major U.S. retailer. They accounted for most of the growth in the Hand Tools and Storage. And in total, as we look at CDIY, we conclude this business is really in great shape as its U.S. market is shoring up nicely while Europe has stabilized and the growth initiatives continue to drive emerging market gains despite somewhat slower markets there. Turning to Industrial. They also had a solid quarter all around, with surging organic growth the new story. Revenues were up 28% or $178 million, aided by Infastech, which added 21 points, and 8% organic growth in total. Segment profit was $117 million, up $22 million or 25%. And organic growth was a great story across the businesses with IAR up 4%; Engineered Fastening, up 9%; and Infrastructure, up 22%. The operating margin rate was down slightly, 50 basis points, reflecting the growth investments and a slight mix down from Infastech. In Engineered Fastening, the automotive segment of Engineered Fastening was up 15%, and that outpaced a plus 1% global light vehicle production. And the Infastech integration is on track, and in fact, their pro forma organic growth was 9% as well. Industrial & Automotive Repair North America was up 2%, with Mac Tools' strength offsetting a very weak government business, and the growth initiatives gaining traction, particularly in the emerging markets and MRO vending. And then the Infrastructure business, which was up 22%, was really, really powered by the oil and gas business or CRC-Evans, which was up over 40% organically, and that was somewhat offset by weakness in the scrap steel market, which affected our hydraulics tools business negatively. The story at oil and gas was the recovery of the North American onshore market, which, as you know, for a year or 2 has been going in the opposite direction for us, and it really, really turned around. And we had seen that coming. In addition to that, we had strong offshore growth in connection with our organic growth initiative. So surging growth in this segment driven by the growth initiatives and Engineered Fastening, performance, all in all, a great story which we expect to continue into the second half. Now moving to Security. It was a mixed picture, with organic growth in mechanical offset by continued Europe weakness, resulting in minus 1% organic growth overall and some margin compression. Revenues were $611 million, up $10 million or 2%. Segment profit was down $18 million or 23% to $61 million. And the organic growth story in North America for CSS was modestly positive at plus 1%, Europe was down 5% for CSS and mechanical was up 4%. I think the bright spot, as John said, and it's very encouraging for CSS was that the second quarter order rates grew in North America and Europe by 7% and 11%, respectively, as its double-digit order growth in the second quarter in Europe and the backlog, in both cases, grew significantly. And that's a direct result of the organic growth initiatives and the Niscayah integration success that is taking place. In mechanical, organic revenue was up 4% on commercial lock, direct to distributor model successes and increased automatic door installation activity at selected retailers. And I will say there's a wave of new product introduction coming in the second half for the mechanical business, which, when coupled with the distribution change and the move to independent distribution, should result in some very, very strong earnings and revenue growth. So overall, the 300-basis-point margin decline in Security was driven by a number of factors: the growth investments, some field cost inefficiency in preparation for increased growth in the second half, the European volume headwinds and the impact of -- the temporary impact of the distributor model shift in the mechanical business. And that basically results from still having the same or similar costs to serve that we had when we had a direct model but taking a slightly lower gross margin in order to run through the distributor channel. And in the second half, you'll see the cost to serve come down as the costs get taken out of the cost structure, and then MAS will restore its profitability to more historical levels. So all the headwinds I just discussed are temporary in nature, and we expect the margin rates to bounce back nicely in the second half. You'll have significant benefits relating to the organic growth investments in both vertical market initiatives and the emerging markets. We will convert the growing order backlog, which will drive field efficiency, as well as revenue growth. We'll complete the mechanical model -- go-to-market model transition. The volume will pick up. Some redundant costs will come out related to the cost to serve that I mentioned and -- as we have now fully shifted to the new indirect distribution model. And then there will be an increased level of Niscayah synergies as they get executed, and you'll recall that, last quarter, we upgraded our estimate from $35 million to $50 million for Niscayah synergies for the year. Most of that impact will be felt in the second half. So these actions will drive operating margin to the mid-teens levels in the second half '13. The growth is coming, and we feel very bullish about the second half for Security, as you can see. And at that point, all 3 of our segments will be driving organic growth, earnings growth and margin expansion. With that, I'll turn it over to Don Allan.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. I'd like to spend a little bit of time and talk about working capital on Page 10. Our working capital turns improved from the prior year by approximately 0.3 turn and sequentially from the first quarter by over 1 turn, which allowed us to drive a significant cash flow benefit in the second quarter, which I'll touch on in a few minutes. We're very focused on how the Stanley Fulfillment System continues to evolve and get implemented throughout our company. We continue to see modest improvements in both accounts receivable and accounts payable as we focus on the back-office operations and have more efficiencies with our vendors and our customers to drive working capital benefits. But the more significant improvement continues to be the focus on inventory, as our inventory days went from 78 days in the second quarter of 2012 down to 72 days here in the second quarter of 2013. In that scenario that we've been focused on significantly for the last year or 2, and we'll continue to be focused on it as we believe there's more efficiency to be gained in inventory throughout our entire manufacturing and supply chain. The impacts of the Stanley Fulfillment System continue to be seen across our company, and our working capital continues to become more efficient. The expectation for year-end 2013 is that we believe we can achieve 8 working capital turns as we continue on our path towards 10 working capital turns by 2016 or 2017. So let's move to free cash flow on the next page. Free cash flow, as I mentioned, was very strong in the second quarter as we achieved a 117% conversion rate, i.e., free cash flow as a percentage of net income. This is obviously before special charges, but the result is really seen by strong earnings performance as well as the strong working capital performance that allows us to drive that type of conversion rate in our company. A couple of items to mention on the free cash flow statement. The first of which is that if you look at the line called other/restructuring, we had some timing issues in the second quarter, which caused a bit of a negative drag. And that has to do with such things as pension payments, which occurred in the second quarter of this year and occurred in different quarters in the prior year, simply a timing issue that we believe neutralizes itself by the end of the year. The other area to notice on the free cash flow statement is the cash outflow associated with our working capital through the first 6 months. You can see it's quite significant. However, it is in line with historical trends. And as many of you know who follow our company, we tend to see a very positive inflow of cash from working capital as the year progresses, and in particular as we get into the fourth quarter, given the seasonality of many of our significant businesses. And as we achieve our 8 working capital turns by the end of the year, we will see that number turn to a significant positive inflow. As a result, although our year-to-date free cash flow trails prior year at this point in time, we believe $1 billion of free cash flow is achievable due to the expected strong second half earnings, which I'll touch on in a few minutes, combined with working capital turns improving to 8 turns and then some of these timing issues beginning to neutralize themselves by the end of the year. So with that, I'd like to spend a few minutes and talk about our guidance. We are reiterating our 2013 outlook today. We expect our EPS to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.65. This will be 16% to 21% EPS growth versus 2012. The vast majority of our guidance items have remained unchanged since April, but there's 2 items of significance that we want to point out that has changed. The first of which is that we're raising our organic revenue guidance from 2% to 3% in our prior guidance up to 4% to 5% growth versus 2012. This is going to drive approximately $0.20 accretion of EPS versus the prior guidance that was provided. Let me give you a little more information and detail on that particular category. If you break it down into core organic growth versus the growth initiatives, we expect the core growth to now be 2% to 3%, which will contribute $0.30 to $0.45 of EPS. That's up from our prior expectation of 1% to 2% organic growth. Additionally, as John mentioned, we believe organic growth initiatives will now yield 2 points of growth versus the previously communicated 1%. However, it still will be slightly dilutive for the year. It will be about 10% dilution versus our prior guidance of $0.15 as we continue to leverage to the effects of the investments during the year, and by the end of the year begin to see some accretion occur related to these growth investments. The second offsetting item that is offsetting this positive impact is we are seeing headwinds related to foreign currency, and we expect that to be approximately $0.20 of EPS to the negative in the second half of the year. Several countries have moved negatively versus the U.S. dollar, where we have a significant presence, such as Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Australia, Mexico and India. We continue to monitor that and are focused on what types of actions we can take to offset that impact, such as areas as customer pricing actions, et cetera. But it clearly appears to be a headwind of significance in the back half of the year. The net effect of this is obviously neutral and allows us to reiterate our guidance range as previously communicated. One other factor I'd like to mention is really the timing of the third quarter versus the fourth quarter associated with EPS. We anticipate the third quarter to approximate 42% of our second half EPS. This is slightly lower than the 46% to 47% historical norm that you see looking out the last 4 or 5 years. It's really being driven by 2 things: it's the expected sequential second half Security profitability improvements that Jim touched on as we see continued sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3 and then more sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4 related to profitability, as well as that particular segment turning to a revenue growth organically versus a slight revenue decline in the first half. The second area is similar to what we discussed in April, is that we continue to see the acceleration and the benefits of our organic growth initiatives throughout the year and the investments weighing that down in the first half, beginning to turn neutral in the third quarter and slightly accretive in the fourth quarter. Those timing factors are resulting in this dynamic that I've just described. The last thing I'd like to touch on on guidance is just a little bit of view on these segments. On the CDIY side, our expectation is that we will see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the entire year, with continued strength similar to what we saw in the second quarter. The operating margin rate will increase year-over-year as we see the benefits of cost synergies. We do expect a slightly negative effect of the growth investments impacting the operating margin rate and offsetting some of the incremental profit or leverage that we see from the volume. In the Security segment, low-single-digit organic growth is expected, as Jim touched on. We believe, based on the order trends and the backlog that's been created here in the first half of the year, that the North American business will begin to show more significant growth beyond current levels. However, that will be slightly offset by a continued low-single-digit decline in Europe, as that European environment continues to be a difficult environment, in particular, for our Security business. The operating margin rate will decrease year-over-year, primarily due to the factors that impacted us here in the first half, but by the end of the year, the business will be back to historical levels in the second half in the mid-teens, as Jim discussed. The Industrial business will see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for 2013, and the operating margin will decrease slightly due really primarily to the effects of the lower-than-line-average Infastech margins as they're in the early stages of integration, as well as the impact of the growth investments. This allows us to reiterate our guidance of $5.40 to $5.65, as well as our free cash flow guidance of approximately $1 billion. So to summarize the presentation portion of the call this morning, we believe we've made excellent progress with the growth initiatives. We're seeing sequential improvement; it is being realized, which allows us to raise our guidance estimate in this particular area. The CDIY business, as Jim touched on, is really performing very well, driving significant organic growth through new product introduction, market share gains and solid returns in the emerging markets, primarily from our growth initiatives. Industrial delivering strong organic growth as well, and the Infastech integration continues to progress on track. We're focused on our Security business continuing to improve and showing more significant returns in the back half of the year as we drive that backlog that we touched on, the benefits from the growth initiatives, continue the integration of Niscayah to really ensure that our second half performance gets closer to historical levels for this particular segment. The company remains focused on driving organic growth and really trying to maximize the synergies across all our businesses that are being impacted by integration today, as well as we're focused on allocating capital that really provides excellent returns for our shareholders in the midterm, as well as the long term. That concludes the presentation portion of the call. We'll turn it over to Q&A.
Gregory Waybright: Great. Thanks, Don. Christine, we can now open the call to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Jason Feldman of UBS.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So nice to see, obviously, that the organic growth initiatives are gaining momentum more quickly, I guess, than expected. How do you think about that in relation to kind of the 3-year targets that you'd laid out, the $850 million contribution. Is this kind of a pull forward and then maybe the incremental pick up in the other years won't be quite as high, we're just getting it sooner? Or is it that the opportunity is really larger than you originally thought?
John F. Lundgren: Jason, it's John. Per my comments early in the presentation, at this stage, it is the former of your 2 hypotheses, specifically, a pull forward. It's very early days, and as we quantify the entire basket of synergies, we're encouraged we're ahead, as opposed to behind schedule. That being said, we just don't have enough information to suggest that that's a larger pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Do -- rest assured, a year from now, we think that's the case, as we did with Black & Decker synergies. When we realized it was more than just a pull forward on the cost synergies. We raised our estimate, raised the guidance. Far, far too early to do that because we've got nothing to tell if the totality of these programs is any greater than what we initially thought about.
James M. Loree: And this is Jim. I would just add to that, that when we set forth this initiative, the idea was to change the culture of the company so it could be capable of generating 4% to 6% organic growth annually. And it was a 3-year commitment that we made, and it was a finite commitment. However, we also indicated that we were hopeful that we would be able to direct the company in a way that would yield a 4% to 6% minimum growth rate on an ongoing basis regardless of the economic environment, and this is where I think this progress that we've made is very encouraging because it seems like while -- even if this is just an acceleration, when we get to 3 years from now, there'll be more acceleration. So the point is that it's a very, very encouraging indication that this company is capable of driving growth while remaining financially disciplined and driving margins as well. So we're excited about the progress. Obviously, not going to commit anything more on a 3-year basis at this point, but it is a very, very positive start.
Operator: Our next question is from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities.
Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I had a question on Security with the European order growth in the quarter. That was a very strong number and just wanted to get some additional color on what you saw in the quarter. I imagine the construction markets over there are not great, so how much of this was just growth with existing customers, new products, market share gains? Any color along those lines would be helpful.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, all of the above. Jim will give you as much detail as we're comfortable giving you, Rich, at this stage.
James M. Loree: It's early days in Niscayah, and when we tackled this acquisition, we learned that Niscayah really didn't have a very robust sales-generation capability. And in fact, it was sort of a symbiotic relationship between Securitas and Niscayah in the sense that Securitas, being primarily more focused on guarding, often would have customers that it would then hand off to Niscayah as sort of a freebie or maybe for a commission or that type of thing. Well, as Securitas and we have gone our separate ways post the acquisition, we found out that we really needed to build -- not rebuild but build sales-generation capability. And I would say that's the single most important factor going on here, is that we've been hiring a lot of sales reps and they've begun to produce orders, which is now, hopefully, going to be translated into sales at some point, and that's encouraging. But it's really that dynamic that is going on. And so while, for the first year, 1.5 years or so, we were experiencing negative growth that I would attribute largely to the economy, it was also due to the fact that we no longer had the sales handoffs from Securitas, and now we have begun to rebuild our own sales force. I'd say that's the single biggest item there.
Operator: Our next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.
Michael Sang - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: It's actually Mike Sang in for Nigel. I was hoping to dig more into pricing. I was wondering if you could comment briefly on the price environment overall. And then specifically on -- in the U.S., in CDIY, where -- I guess just in CDIY, where you, I guess, lost 2 points from pricing this quarter. And then, separately, on Security side, whether the increase in orders was due to -- based on given pricing.
Donald Allan: Mike, it's Don. I'll give you a little bit more color on that topic in particular. On CDIY, in the second quarter, we did have a fair amount of promotional activity, which was planned and expected, and so that's driving a little bit of that price impact. It's probably unusually high compared to previous quarters and future quarters because of that factor. The other thing to keep in mind, and we all know this over the long term, is that that pricing number is more of an accounting number. It doesn't necessarily capture the true effect of pricing impacts across the board. As we roll out new products at different price points, that price increase versus a previous product that it's replacing does not get captured in that line. So we know that in that particular business it's not exactly a full encompassing view. So those 2 factors together really are driving that impact. So I don't view it as a significant trend or change in the business. I think it's more related to certain promotional activities that we did in the second quarter that were expected and planned. In the Security side of our company, Security is an area that pricing -- it is a price-sensitive business, but you really drive value through the differentiation of service, as well as the differentiation of bundling the different products that you have and trying to install and enhance the solution to our customers. And that's how you really drive positive price value. I think, over the long term, it's a business that you can drive positive price, and we have demonstrated this in this particular business over the past several years, that it is a business that allows that type of pricing situation. The current market in Security is there's nothing unusual happening around pricing specifically. I think it's pretty much in line with typical trends, and nothing has shifted or no dynamic that's happening that's unusual at this stage.
John F. Lundgren: Well, in fact, a couple of quarters ago, we indicated that we thought that maybe we've been getting a little more aggressive on pricing, taking some business that we perhaps, in retrospect, would not have wanted to take in the CSS North America business. And so Don and I have both spent a fair amount of time with the Security team, going through their pricing, their price discipline, going through their backlog and looking at the profitability of the backlog. And I can tell you that it is improving, and the new business, largely being driven by the vertical market initiative and from the organic growth initiative, the vertical market initiative is where we have put together the bundles and the value propositions that Don is referring to. And in fact, what we're finding out in a lot of these orders in the order book in general from the vertical market initiative is that the gross margins are coming in at somewhat above line average. And that is where we want it to be because we think the value that we generate in these verticals is very high and therefore, we should get paid for it.
Operator: Our next question is from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Jim, the oil and gas strength, I understand it's off of a relatively small base. I know -- I think you have also had some organizational changes within your CRC business, but it just -- the growth seems to be a real outlier, particularly based on what, I guess, broad trends would be in the line pipe industry in the U.S. How sustainable are those growth rates? And how should we be looking at that going forward?
James M. Loree: Yes, I mean, we've had some tough experience in onshore North America over the last few years, which have made the comps relatively easy. So I do think we have a couple of easy comps in front of us. However, I wouldn't be looking for plus 40% every quarter. That said, the pipeline construction activity in North America is really almost back at the level it was about 4 years ago when it peaked, and we can see that. We've been talking for a couple of quarters about the strengthening market. But it takes -- it took a couple of quarters for us to actually go from doing the proposals and so forth to actually doing the work, which is when we are able to recognize the revenue. So we see -- this is a long-cycle business. We have good visibility forward in North America onshore, and we see a continued strong market, not greater than 40% growth, but certainly very robust. And as far as the offshore business goes, which is the other half of the puzzle, that is extremely strong worldwide, and we expect that to continue as well. So this should be a good growth driver for us for several quarters, if not years to come.
John F. Lundgren: Sam, let me just add to that because the format won't allow a follow-up. You'll recall, when we bought this business about 3 years ago, it's new in terms of the business model, relatively new to Stanley Black & Decker. And to Jim's point, these are generally very large orders. They're very lumpy, and it's a huge difference on a $300 million revenue base if something comes in in the second quarter versus the third quarter. So even at the beginning of our ownership of this company, it's a very lumpy business. It may be the best way to describe it. And I think for your purposes and objectives and ours as well, looking at rolling 12 months or rolling 8 quarters, looking at things that way, as opposed to just the much more classic EP-wise [ph] just because of seasonality and things of that nature, is a better way to look at this business. And that's how Don's team looks at it as we try to get a better grip on it and how best to forecast. At the end of the day, though, it's going to be lumpy. If you do $320 million in a year, it's not going to be $80 million a quarter. It's going to be $60 million 1 quarter and $100 million the next, and that's just something we've learned to live with with this business. And your question is very fair, but just recognize that's the dynamic, I would say, unique to the oil and gas business.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Wood of Macquarie.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Research: Impressive growth with your growth initiatives. I'm curious, at the early stages, what you're seeing in terms of the competitor responses from the market share gains that you're getting in these countries.
Donald Allan: Well, we're not seeing much yet. Power tools in the emerging markets are very hotly contested by our biggest competitors anyway. So in some ways, I would argue that we're a little bit later to the game than some of them. However, we haven't really seen any major competitive response. I think it's really too early for that, and there were a lot people betting against whether these initiatives would even be successful, and I suspect that competitive reaction will come once the success has been institutionalized.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, Mike. It would be naïve for us to think -- for we, Stanley Black & Decker, to think that as the share gains start to register -- remember, we're seeing them first in our shipments and in the POS. Competitors will see them 3 to 6 months later as they evaluate our performance versus theirs and others. It would be -- it would simply be naïve and irresponsible of us not to expect reaction because no one relinquishes share willingly. Hey, this is the power tools business. It's -- the tools business in general and the power tools business in particular. We've been in it for 100 years, and that would be our expectation.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Kim of Barclays.
John Coyle - Barclays Capital, Research Division: It's actually John filling in for Steve today. Just wanted to get a bit more granularity on the FX headwind outlook. It seems like the currencies you cited are pretty contained for like 25% of sales. So I thought it was a little big 2% -- $0.20 just in the back half of the year. So what is your outlook for the back half in those currencies?
Donald Allan: Yes, well, we basically have taken the rates that -- of about a week, 1.5 weeks ago or so and are using them as, really, our forecast for the back half of the year. We don't tend to try to forecast trending, whether they're going to go up or down. As far as the magnitude of the number, you have to remember that, in particular, Brazil and Canada and Australia are pretty sizable businesses for us and make up a significant amount of revenue. The other thing to factor in is it's not just translational FX, it's transactional FX, which means we're shipping products into those countries, in many cases, from the United States or European markets, and so the cross-currency exchange has a negative impact as a result.
John F. Lundgren: Well, I think it's about 50-50.
Donald Allan: It ends up being about 50-50, exactly, John. So those are really the main drivers. But the transactional piece is why it ends up being bigger than anticipated. Now part of that is hedge, but we don't hedge 100% of those types of activities because of the cost associated with hedging.
James M. Loree: And the Latin American moves were very, very sudden and sharp. They're big moves.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, John, you referenced 25%. That's roughly the percentage of our business in Western Europe. And obviously, the pound sterling and euro is all that matters to us there. 50% of our business is outside the U.S., and there are very few currencies in the back half of the year strengthening relative to the dollar. So I think Don gave you some pretty good granularity there. And hopefully, that will help understand and validate the magnitude of the headwind.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.
William Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's actually Will Wong on for Mike. Can you talk about the trends in Latin America, especially in Brazil as it relates to the consumer? There were some challenges in 1Q. So just wondering what type of impact you would expect to your organic sales growth initiatives if consumer trends and sort of the political environments in some of these countries deteriorate from current levels.
John F. Lundgren: Rank has its privileges so I'm going to delegate that to Jim because if he can predict what's going to happen in Brazil quarter-to-quarter, he's a better man than I. But we did have -- your point is very well taken, in that we really were stunned by the difficulty in Brazil in the first quarter. It was a lot more friendly market in the second quarter, but Jim's been close to that. Give it a whack, Jim.
James M. Loree: Brazil consumer market, definitely a little slower than it has been. However, all these markets in Latin America are just exceptionally volatile, and they bounce around from the markets themselves and the demand bounces around from quarter-to-quarter and then the currencies bounce around from quarter-to-quarter, so your pricing positioning in the market changes dramatically over time. And in addition to that, there are some countries that have major political, structural processes that drive further inefficiencies in the demand profile and supply and demand. So it's hard to predict anything in Latin America other than just go there and execute as hard and as fast as you can. And that's where we're adding salespeople, bringing new products that are more appropriately designed for the mid price point segment and so forth, to enable us to achieve growth rates that are definitely above market growth rates. And that's what we're -- what we've been doing in Latin America for a long time because that's where we've -- really, this formula that we're now applying to all the emerging markets has been applied for the last 10 years by the management team that is now running the overall emerging markets initiative. And that's -- they're finding actually that some of these other markets around the world are more stable than Latin America and therefore, sometimes easier to penetrate than perhaps Latin America.
John F. Lundgren: Just to follow up, Jim made a very important point. And I just -- and it's probably not news to most people, but unlike several North American-based or U.S. multinationals operating in foreign markets, particularly Latin America, I think it's really important to point out our entire emerging markets group in general and the Latin American group in particular is staffed by foreign nationals who have grown up in, lived in those markets that are well-tenured executives within our company. And this isn't about me. I spent half of my business career living and working abroad. And the value added by people who understand our company and our company's culture, values, codes of conduct, everything else, at the same time, understand the markets, the people, the culture, quite frankly, are quite accustomed to dealing with day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month volatility and frustrations that Jim, I think, very, very adequately described is a huge advantage. So that's just a point that I thought worth making on our emerging markets team, it's -- they are tenured professionals with local experience that we're leveraging across the world. And I actually -- I truly believe it's a competitive advantage, and I just wanted to make that point.
Operator: Our next question is from Peter Lisnic of Robert Baird.
Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: This is Josh Chan filling in for Pete. You talked about how the order growth accelerated in CSS Europe, but North America also accelerated quite a bit. So could you talk a little bit about what you saw there?
James M. Loree: Yes. I was referring earlier to these vertical market initiatives and they're part of the corporate organic growth initiative that we funded especially and announced a while ago, last July. And we've been working on these growth initiatives in Security, in the vertical markets for about a year now. And what they involve is taking certain markets such as financial services, education, K-12 and secondary education separately, health care, retail and so forth and putting together solutions for the customers using some of the proprietary technology that we have acquired over time, such as our RTLS technology, real-time locating and sensing technology, that would be the AeroScout -- or excuse me, the iLock technology, which is iris identification, and putting together solutions that are specifically designed for applications within these vertical markets. So for example, in the K-12 environment, having the ability to lock down the school using this type of technology or to identify potential intruders, to integrate the mechanical locking systems with electromechanical locking systems and electronic systems, all these types of things are relevant to the end customers. And I could -- we have a demonstration center in Indianapolis, where we have all these different solutions kind of identified, and we bring customers in and so on. And the sales force has now been organized so that we have a segment of the sales force that's specialized to each one of these verticals, and that's what's gaining momentum right now. And in addition to, I'd say, just decent execution in the rest of the market, that's what's providing the extra oomph for the growth. And we expect -- we've seen, on a monthly basis, that order rate is increasing on a sequential basis and really beginning to grow like a wave of new business. And some of it is medium-cycle, long-cycle business, so it takes a while. But we will see that come to fruition in the second half in North America. And in Europe, we think, to some extent, not as much because the vertical market solutions that I'm talking about are primarily, I'd say, almost exclusively focused on the North American markets right now. We're still in the process of integrating Niscayah. When we get to the point that the Niscayah organization is ready in Europe, these solutions are exportable to Europe, and we will do that at that time. So they will provide future growth in Europe. None of that's really baked in to any of the long-term guidance that we've given. However, that's sort of the reason that you start to see North America order rates pick up in Security.
Operator: Our next question is from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: Question for you on CDIY, nice acceleration of growth in 2Q versus 1Q. Just wondering if you can dig in a little bit more to the 2Q growth. You talked about promotions and some new products, and I'm assuming some of the outdoor move from 1Q to 2Q. So wonder if you can break up the 6% and some of the components of that and then how you think about the core and the benefit from some of the efforts in the second half for the 5% or better growth you're talking about in the second half.
John F. Lundgren: Sure, Eric. Everything you said, Eric, is correct in terms of outdoor moves, promotions. You'll recall Jim mentioned some major mechanics tools and hand tools moves, but Don can give you even a little more granularity to the extent we're comfortable.
Donald Allan: Sure. As Jim touched on, in the second quarter, the growth was significant really in almost all the areas of the business, both geographically and across what we call the SBUs. And there was a promotional aspect in the second quarter, where, in the prior year, that occurred in the first quarter, so that was a factor. We did have the shift of the outdoor season into q -- from Q1 to Q2, and that'll continue to shift into Q3 as the season ends in a month -- roughly in a month or so. So those are all factors. But the reality is what you see within this business is that the new product introductions that they keep rolling out continue to drive organic growth and gain share. The emerging market growth, through the organic growth initiatives, are accelerating to a mid-teens growth or 15% in emerging markets in the second quarter that we expect to continue into the back half. And then we don't talk a lot about Europe, but frankly, the European performance was very strong for them, where they had a relatively flat performance in a very difficult market. And that's allowing us to demonstrate all the other growth that we're seeing and have it flow through across the entire global business of CDIY. And that European flat performance is really because of share gain, as well as some new product introductions that help facilitate that, primarily in the U.K. and in the Nordic regions. So all those factors together are the result of what happened in the second quarter, as Jim articulated. But the reality is as we see those trends continuing in the back half, and the growth that they experienced of roughly 6% is expected to continue in the back half of the year because of all the factors I just mentioned.
Operator: Our next question is from Liam Burke of Janney Capital Markets.
Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: You had a very, very strong quarter on industrial, in particular IAR. Could you give us a little color on where in emerging markets you're gaining traction? That seems to be in addition to the strength of the Mac business, an area that's done pretty well.
John F. Lundgren: Sure. We had 4% growth in IAR, and we had double-digit growth in the emerging markets. So that was a good -- one of the big forces behind the growth, as you point out. I think, well, first of all, the answer to your question is very simply that the emerging market growth initiative is what's driving that double-digit growth in the emerging markets. But more specifically, we're very fortunate because we are the only tool company that has both Construction & DIY strength in the emerging markets, as well as Industrial & Automotive Repair access to those markets, channel access. So the way we're going about this is, as opposed to coming at it from one perspective or the other, we're coming at it -- we've joined forces internally between our Construction & DIY business and our IAR business. And that has actually given us much better access to, I think, the emerging of the IAR channels than we otherwise would have because what happens in the -- many of these emerging markets is that the channels are very blurred in between Construction & DIY and Industrial. You don't have -- in many, many of these markets, you don't have the highly developed channels that distinguish between construction and then large retail -- I mean, construction, 2-step large retail, industrial channel, automotive repair channel. You don't have that in the emerging markets. You have much more chaotic channels, much less well-developed channels. And our ability to come at it from a joint perspective and cooperate internally between our Construction & DIY business and our IAR business, I think, gives us the ability to drive that growth the way I just described.
Operator: Our next question is from Dennis McGill of Zelman and Associates.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: I think this question maybe is for Jim. But is there a way to take the backlog, both across electronic and mechanical, and just think about Security backlog overall and have one number as far as what you're entering third quarter with as far as the growth year-over-year? And then kind of within that, Jim, is there a way to separate out what you're seeing market-wise on the Security -- or nonresidential side from what your internal initiatives are? Are there signs, in your opinion, that you're starting to see the market actually pick up and get into a cyclical recovery?
John F. Lundgren: Yes, Dennis, this is John. Jim will take it. But just one point, and we've made this many times, but I think it's important to make it again on backlog. Whether it's one number or 2, what's more important is when it's executable or convertible. As we've increased our sophistication with architectural specifiers and things of that nature, we could have an order in the system that can't be executed until 12 to 15 months from now because, if you think about new construction, we're at the very end of the process. I mean, as the building is being finished, it's when wires are being laid or our systems are being put in. So whether you have one number or 2, it's not possible for us, and as a consequence, I guarantee it's not possible for you, to take that and have it be of much value to you in terms of the next quarter or quarter after that. But I just think it's important to make that point, but Jim can give you just a little more detail.
James M. Loree: I mean, I would only make 2 points, and that is definitely one of them, which is that the mechanical part of the business and frankly, the electronic are both at the tail end of the process. The second one is that, without question, there is an increase in the level of non-resi construction activity and increasing backlog related to that in the Security business. I mean, that is a piece of the puzzle. It's a much bigger piece of the puzzle in the mechanical business than it is in the electronic business. But it is, in fact, true that the non-resi construction market is picking up steam and therefore, affecting both these businesses.
Operator: Our next question is from Dan Oppenheim of Crédit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was wondering, John, I guess you talked in the past a lot about the goals of getting to 20% in terms of emerging market exposure. Now you're getting awfully close to that. Given the different growth rates in some of the markets, so this may be -- it's always a moving target. As you think about this, where do you now think of it in terms of what your goal would be for emerging market exposure?
John F. Lundgren: I don't know if you -- it doesn't matter if you directed it to me or Don. Our goals are unchanged. And as we would have a tendency to do, when and if it looks like we're going to achieve it and it's adding value to our shareholders, we'll raise that bar. But your point is correct. The combination of divestiture of HHI, acquisition of Infastech and good growth, we've gone from 10% or 11% up to 16% or 17%, depending on the quarter on an annual basis. We closed the year at about 16%. So we're getting there quickly. As we start to approach it, that 20% could well become 25%, if those markets remain as profitable as they are now. It's incredibly important not just to grow but to grow profitably. And as Don and Jim have pointed out in various conversations, these markets are at or above line average in many cases, which is not the case for a lot of businesses. So 20% could well become 25%, but let's get 20% in the bank before we change that goal. So what we talked to you and the investment community about in May, those goals are all unchanged.
Operator: Our next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: Just on the Security business, encouraging to see the order book building. But wonder if you could just help us by elaborating on that 310-basis-point margin decline. And you'd parsed out 4 different drivers in your presentation, Jim, and I was just wondering if I could get you to elaborate on that and maybe quantify the contribution to that 310 basis points.
James M. Loree: I mean, there's not much more I can elaborate other than to say that if you take those 4 items, they really do account for the vast majority of the 300 basis points. And they're all significant, so I could say they're roughly 25% a piece or whatever. That's directionally accurate but...
Donald Allan: They're all within 20% to 30%.
James M. Loree: Yes, they're all within 20% to 30%.
Donald Allan: Or each one is within 10% to 30%, I should say.
Gregory Waybright: Christine, I believe that's all the time we have for questions, and we'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning. I know certain of you weren't able to ask a question. Please give me a call after the call, and we'll be able to handle and accommodate any questions you have. And thank you, all, for your attendance and participation this morning. Thank you.
Operator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2013 Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lorraine, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Kate Vanek. Ms. Vanek, you may begin.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Thanks so much, Lorraine. Good morning, everybody. Thank you, all, for joining us this morning for Stanley Black & Decker's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is: John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Senior Vice President and Group Executive, CDIY. Our earnings release, which was issued this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR portion of our website as well as our newly revamped iPhone and iPad app and mobile website. The replay of the call will begin today at 2:00 p.m. Replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim, Don and Jeff will review Stanley's first quarter 2013 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As always, please feel free to contact me with any sort of follow-up questions that don't get covered during the Q&A portion. And as I normally have to do, we are going to be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act. With that, I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us this morning for our first quarter earnings call. Just as a top line summary, despite a slow start to the year from a volume perspective, we exited the first quarter '13 with a lot of momentum that, you'll hear later from Don, gave us confidence that we will achieve our fiscal year previous guidance and targets from an income perspective. Revenues increased 3%. And that was largely due to the inclusion of Infastech, which closed in February. That acquisition actually took several months longer to close than normal as we waited for various Asian government approvals, so we didn't get as much benefit in the first quarter as we expected. But the extra time really allowed us to hit the ground running. And that integration is progressing very smoothly and on or ahead of schedule now that we've started. The organic growth initiatives that we've talked about in past quarters, they gained traction at an encouraging rate. But our core business organic growth did decline. Volume was down 1%. It was due primarily to a slow start to the North American outdoor product season, combined with temporary soft markets in Latin America and modest continued contractions in Europe. A bright spot was CDIY operating margin. It expanded 160 basis points despite flat organic growth. And we do remain on track for mid-single-digit organic growth for the fiscal year. And as Kate said, we have Jeff Ansell, our Senior Vice President and Group Executive, responsible for that business, to give you a little more insight on that a little later on in the call. Organic growth in Mechanical Security did -- was offset by some declines in Convergent Security in Europe. And as a consequence, our Security segment profitability was temporarily pressured by installation mix and volume declines, primarily focused in the Nordic region, historically a very strong region for the legacy Niscayah business. And moving on to Niscayah. The 2013 synergy estimate has been increased by $15 million. The total program estimate, we're now taking a second look at it to think that we may even be able to get more, not this year but next year in 2014, as we combine that business with the former Stanley Black & Decker Convergent Security business in Europe. 1Q diluted earnings per share of $1.03 was up 5% versus prior year. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.52. And as I suggested and Don will give you more insight, we are reiterating fiscal year organic growth EPS and free cash flow guidance. Let's take a quick look at our organic growth initiatives, which suggest that they're on track to contribute about 1 point, 100 basis points of organic growth for this year. During the first quarter, we invested an incremental $16 million in spending. And a lot of that was in feet on the street, 370 new associates hired with about 2/3 of them, 225, in the emerging markets, where we believe our greatest opportunity for growth is, growth and volume leverage rests. All of the initiatives are tracking to their 3-year goals. And as previously stated, that's $850 million in incremental revenue and $200 million in incremental profit. But let's take a look at some of the markets, drilling down into some of the geographies. We're going to spend less time on geographies in general than we do historically. That is in your appendix or will be in the appendix. But if you see all the emerging markets with the exception of one, a large one, showed very, very strong increases: Russia, plus 19%; China, 13%; Northeast Asia, 13%; Turkey, 12%; Southeast Asia, 7%. Latin America experienced, I'll say, what we believe is a confluence of temporary issues and they're different in each country: Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia. But as a consequence, our largest emerging market group, Latin America, where we have very strong market positions, is actually down 2%, which we think is temporary. So that gave us a combined total of plus 2% in our total emerging market group, which is below where it has been historically and below where we believe it will be as the year progresses and certainly on an ongoing basis. Let me turn it over to Jeff Ansell who, as I said, is the man in charge of our CDIY business. And he's got some fairly exciting opportunities in his business that he's going to give you some more detail on.
Jeffery D. Ansell: Thank you, John. Looking at the CDIY results for 1Q. Total revenues, plus 2%, driven predominantly by the Powers acquisition. Organic revenues, flat. As you can see in the upper left, our PPT or our DeWalt business, positive. It was, however, pressured in the quarter due to intentional promotional timing change, moving promotions that occurred in Q1 2012 to Q2 and 3 2013 to match the building seasons in North America and Europe, intentionally done as well. Our cordless products performed very well in the quarter pervasively. From a CPG or a Black & Decker perspective, positive. From a power tool perspective, the outdoor season began late, and thus, pressured the results. But overall, positive results in the Black & Decker business, with growth primarily attributed to new products, including Matrix, Gyro, et cetera. In our HT&S business or our Hand Tool business, exceptional growth in our DeWalt Hand Tool range was really offset by weakness in Europe, Brazil and Colombia during the quarter. If you look at the center of the page, you could see the track record over the previous 4 quarters of, on average, mid-single-digit growth with this quarter being flat. The 2 reasons are outlined in this portion of the chart. Outdoor, given a 4-week late start due entirely to weather, put 2 points of pressure into the quarter. The Latin American business, as John referenced earlier, added 1 point of pressure. So sans those 2 things, we would've had consistent growth with previous quarters. We do feel good about the correction in the outdoor season, which I'll come on to in a few minutes. And the Latin American business was trending quite positive during the course of the quarter. It essentially just took a little longer to sell through inventories from 2012 than expected, about 6 weeks longer. So you can see the depiction, where January was down 15%; February, down 6%; March, rebounded very nicely to plus 15%. So really the first half of the quarter was pressured. The second half of the quarter was much more consistent with our previous results in Latin America. And finally, in the upper right portion of the chart, you can see that profit rates expanded by 160 basis points, driven by mix, cost synergies and promotional timing to a record 14.5% for the first quarter. Turning to the following page. I want to reiterate as strongly as I can our commitment and confidence to mid-single-digit growth for the year even with a flat first quarter. Why do we have such confidence? Well, they're depicted here; 5 reasons, primarily. First is around emerging markets. We believe we'll have continued strength in Asia and other emerging markets, which were up mid-double-digits in the quarter, along with the Latin American recovery that I just outlined, that's already begun. Additionally, we added 185 sales and product headcounts during the quarter. That investment, combined with investment in programming from emerging markets, will certainly improve our business sequentially as these resources and programs gain traction over the course of the remainder of the year. Number two reason for confidence is new product development. We have very robust power tool, hand tool and home product new product plans. The launch cycle for our new products really begins in March through October. So very little impact in the first quarter but much greater impact over the coming portions of the year. A couple of examples to highlight. In March, we launched the world's first cordless, brushless framing nailer. That product competes extraordinarily favorably with anything that exists in the marketplace. It is the first framer to use cordless battery technology. It does not require disposable fuel cells, which is a negative to the user. And it works in any climate, any temperature, which is also unique. Based on the initial response to that product, we have doubled and are working to triple our capacity for that product for the remainder of this year. Additionally, we have really strong momentum in our DeWalt Hand Tool range, up about 30%, as the trend line goes. And then our new steam products, which have led us to the #1 position in Europe, continue to drive growth. So things like that really give us great confidence. And in general, our cordless business outperforming the market while being #1 is another reason for confidence in the terms of new product development. The third area to outline is promotional planning. Programming for 2013 essentially starts in Q2 and Q3 versus Q1 of last year. We intentionally moved the timing of these promotions to coincide with the building season in Western Europe and North America because those investments in Q2 and 3 versus Q1 will provide greater ROI for our customers and for ourselves. So we feel very good about that, and that will add volume strength for the coming quarters. Fourth, the outdoor season. The analytics have told us recently that April would be the kickoff to this season. We've seen that to be true. Last year, the outdoor season began in week 10. This year, the outdoor season began in week 14. So essentially, we lost a month in the outdoor business, which occurred in Q1. The point would be, though, the duration of the outdoor season is the same length regardless of when it starts. It will run 5 months, the starting point varies. So we will now run from April to August versus last year, March to July. It's very consistent year-over-year. And we have very strong cordless and corded listings across our enterprise, so we feel very good about the uptick once the season does begin. And on average, temperatures globally were minus 11 degrees from where they were this time last year. So a lot of reasons why this season is starting late. And then fifth and final but not least is we have really strong revenue synergy plans continuing through the year. We will unveil for you one of these major or mega programs at our meeting in June. Subsequently, we have another mega launch in the third quarter. Both have confirmation with customers and channels in the market already. We just don't talk about those things till they're in the market. And we'll show you again 2 major programs, 1 in Q2, 1 in Q3, with a lot of activity there with really good traction. So in closing, strong profit improvement in the quarter, plus 2% total growth, flat organic sales. But with a track record of organic growth in the mid-single-digits as depicted on Q1, we believe we have really strong prospects in front of us. Organic growth headwinds in the quarter were clearly timing and clearly temporary. We remain committed to the growth elements in emerging markets with lag already recovering; with new product development really starting in March running through October; promotional activity as a tailwind in Q2 and Q3 versus a headwind in Q1; the outdoor season starting, as we speak, albeit later than last year; and really compelling revenue synergy plans that are built and ready to execute. So we reiterate our confidence in mid-single-digit growth through the remainder of 2013. Thank you.
James M. Loree: Okay. Thank you, Jeff. Exciting story there and all the more exciting because we really didn't even talk about a recovering U.S. housing market, which as we speak, is indisputably taking place. So no reliance on that, but certainly that's going on as well. Let's turn over to Security now. Overall revenues were $599 million versus $592 million a year ago. Organic growth was minus 1%. And despite an OM rate of 10.3% even lower than normal for first quarter, there was some very positive developments in Security during the quarter. Let's start with organic growth, which was very solid in several U.S.-centric businesses, including Electronic Security, which was up 3%; mechanical, which was up 5%; and access doors, which was up 4% organically. Europe, while not surprisingly under some volume pressure, will outperform its 2013 synergy commitment by $15 million, as John mentioned, thus protecting full year operating margin and ensuring that the Niscayah acquisition produces a solid return on investment. Now some of the CSS or Electronic Security volume growth has come at the expense of OM rate in the first quarter. And I believe we're at an inflection point where the exciting new vertical solutions in K-12 education, health care, financial services and retail are ready to be deployed. And with a differentiated value to be sold, we are training and reinforcing a value pricing mindset with the field, which will address this issue, in addition to some other margin improvement actions that the team is taking. So we expect to see flat deposit of organic growth for the year with overall operating margin slightly positive year-over-year and growing growth momentum heading into the second half and 2014. And moving to Industrial. Industrial is also pressured by Europe, especially in Industrial & Automotive Repair. Total revenues were $695 million versus $662 million a year ago. Organic growth was minus 1%. The profit rate was 14.1%. It was pressured by lower volume on the higher-margin European business, cost absorption issues and investment in the organic growth initiatives. Now as we take them business-by-business. Industrial & Automotive Repair organic revenues were down 4%. The U.S. was flat. Europe was down 9%. The good news here is the comps for both Europe and the total business ease as we get into second quarter and beyond, second half of the year as well. In the U.S., a strong Mac Tools performance was offset by weak government business and Industrial MRO business for the Proto business. I'd like to highlight one of our organic growth initiatives, the smart tools and storage, or otherwise known as Advanced Industrial Solutions, was up 5% organically, with CribMaster up double-digits on vending success in MRO. In Engineered Fastening, they were flat organically. The automotive business grew 6%, outpacing a 4% decline in global light vehicle production. The North America auto business was up 7%. Europe was up 2%, as auto-related market share gains offset declines in Industrial and a $5 million shipment timing issue, which was customer-driven, and pushed $5 million of revenue into the second quarter at the expense of first quarter revenue. Japan, with its difficult situation in the auto industry, was down 8% on a 16% light vehicle production decline. And as John mentioned, the Infastech acquisition closed on February 27 and the integration is progressing well. This exciting new addition to the portfolio will add significant growth potential through emerging market and electronics content. And then Infrastructure really was a bright light in the quarter as the offshore pipeline business drove 9% organic growth in CRC, a very positive sign as the U.S. onshore business is gaining cyclical traction and the offshore business continues to grow. So stay tuned for a very strong 2013 for CRC-Evans. Now I'll turn it over to Don Allan, who will take you through the financial aspects of the quarter.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. I'd like to start on Page 10 and talk about our free cash flow performance for the first quarter. There's really 3 things that I'd like to point out. You can see that the performance was a negative cash flow of $132 million, slightly worse than our anticipated result. And let me walk through some of the details associated with that. The first of which is working capital. As most of you know in the first quarter, we tend to see a sequential decline in our working capital turns, which we did see from the fourth quarter to the first quarter from 7.5 turns in the fourth quarter to 6 turns here in the first quarter. That was about 0.5 turn lower than our expectation. And it's really being driven by a couple things. First of all, the lower overall volumes in the first quarter, as well as the timing of the revenue within the quarter. As you've heard in various pieces of the call this morning, January and February were very slow in certain parts of the company, and then March began to accelerate and we saw improvement. That timing dynamic certainly caused pressure to the working capital number. The good news is that's a temporary phenomena. We don't see that as any major concern for the year. And we still believe for the year, we will have modest working capital turns improvement year-over-year. The second item of note is other. Other is an area that always in the first quarter we see a large negative outflow. That's where annual rebates, bonuses, et cetera, get paid, and that impact is reflected there. And then CapEx, slightly higher versus the prior year, as we expected, due to certain growth initiative investments we're making, as well as other key investments around the overall strategy. We still expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 2.5% to 3% of annualized revenue this year. So the first quarter performance, although a little bit worse than we anticipated, we are not concerned. We believe that these are temporary issues that will subside and correct themselves in 2Q. And we'll still be able to achieve $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year. So with that, I'd like to move to Page 11 and talk about our guidance reiteration for 2013. We believe that we will still be within the range of $5.40 and $5.65 EPS for the full year. That'll be 16% to 21% EPS growth versus 2012. The factors on the left side of the slide indicate the items that we are reiterating associated with these certain assumptions within this range. The first is organic growth. We still believe we will grow 2% to 3% versus 2012. And the dynamics within that are consistent with what we said in January, where the core business will grow 1% to 2% and our organic growth initiatives will yield 1 point, but they will be dilutive by $0.15 to EPS. The cost synergies associated with BDK of $0.23 and carryover cost reduction actions of $0.15 are consistent with January. And then Jim touched on, as well as John, the Infastech acquisition. We still believe the accretion will be $0.20 for the full year and even with the 1 month delay in the timing of the closing. Our share repurchase has gone successfully with $0.37 benefit. That will be completed in the coming weeks and be behind us. And that's really associated with a large portion of the proceeds received from the HHI divestiture. Moving over to the right side of the page. There's a few items that are changing but do have a neutral impact. The first of which we have mentioned a couple times this morning that we believe the Niscayah cost synergies will be $15 million higher in 2013, now $50 million for the year. That is offsetting some of the volume and rate pressures that we're seeing in the CSS business. So a net neutral impact. And then there's 3 additional items that are neutral as well. A small change in our other net assumption, which is causing a positive of $0.05 versus our January guidance. Tax rate is still within the range of 23% to 24% but is trending towards the low end of the range, so that will be a slight positive as well. And then we have a little bit of pressure in our shares outstanding. So our outstanding share number is expected to be slightly higher. Moving to Page 12. A few more assumptions associated with our guidance. On the segment side, you've heard from both Jeff and Jim some of the assumptions associated with the full year. For CDIY, very consistent with what we said in January, still believe that our organic revenues will be mid-single-digit. We expect the OM rate to expand year-over-year as we see continued benefit of synergies, as well as incremental profit associated with volume and a slight offset associated with some of the investments related to our growth initiative. Security, similar story to January as well, a flat to low single-digit organic growth, although we have a mix in the geographies, where we'll see growth in North America with offsetting pressure in the European markets. We do expect our OM rate to expand slightly year-over-year, as we will execute more cost synergies related to Niscayah, as well as carry over some of the cost actions from last year. And then on the Industrial side, flat to low single-digit organic growth as well, similar dynamic in the geographies, where we see growth in North America. However, a retracting environment in Europe that's partially offsetting that. And then the OM rate will actually slightly decrease year-over-year in this segment, as we see a temporary impact from Infastech margins being below line average, as well as the investments in growth initiatives. The one last item I'd like to mention associated with guidance is looking at the first half and the second half associated with EPS. Due to the growth investments that we have engaged and made and started in the end of 2012 and the timing associated with the dilutive impact of that $0.15, the vast majority of that $0.15 dilutive EPS impact will happen in the first half of 2013 and will have a neutral impact from the growth initiatives in the back half of the year as they begin to turn accretive, and we expect them to be significantly accretive in 2014. That creates a dynamic when you look at the first half versus the second half, where we expect the second half to represent 60% of the full year EPS, i.e. the first half will be 40%. That's slightly off historical trends, where if you look at the last 3 years of our company, the second half tended to be between 56% and 58%. The main difference between that and our expectation this year is these investments in the growth initiatives and the timing associated with that. So overall, we believe that we'll continue to see -- we will see solid growth in CDIY in mid-single-digits that will outpace Security and Industrial as we begin to see growth in the residential end markets that's outpacing the commercial and industrial markets. So with that, to summarize the call, I'll pass it back to John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Don. So just to wrap it up, hopefully it's clear that we remain focused on driving our organic growth initiatives and efficiencies across the company, maximizing the synergies across our lines of business and certainly allocating capital in ways that provide excellent returns for our shareholders. We are reiterating full year organic growth EPS and free cash flow guidance. The organic growth initiatives are gaining traction and are on track to achieve our 3-year targets of approximately $850 million in organic revenue and $200 million in incremental operating profit. CDIY, as Jeff, I think, walked you through very clearly, will grow mid-single-digits organically for the year, fueled by new products, market share gains and a return to growth in our emerging markets. In Security, which has historically been among our higher-margin businesses, we expect profitability will improve throughout the year, as the Niscayah integration synergies and the benefits of a modified field sales model in North America begin to hit the bottom line. And as a consequence, we expect modest year-over-year improvement. So 2013 will be another solid step towards the achievement of our mid-decade vision with 2% to 3% organic growth and 16% to 21% earnings per share expansion. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Kate and Lorraine, and we'll start our Q&A.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Great. Thanks, John. Lorraine, let's open up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: John, I wonder if you could just talk about market share trends within the Security business, particularly the Convergent Security business.
John F. Lundgren: Sure. Within Convergent Security, we clearly lost a slight bit of share both in Europe and North America, some of which was programmed. If I start with the U.S., we've got some good installs and, as Jim suggested in his segment overview, some of those larger jobs came at the expense of margin. But even with that, we arguably have, I would say, very, very, very modest share decline in North America as we attempt to upgrade our mix and integrate the Niscayah business. And we remain highly focused on new vertical markets, such as financial services, government, education. If you'll recall, our largest single market right now or vertical market is retail. And of course, that's not a very, very robust market. So globally, we arguably saw some modest share loss, which we believe is temporary. Europe, as I suggested, our business remains very strong. We remain a market leader. We did suffer some share loss, particularly in the Nordic markets in Sweden, a legacy Niscayah stronghold. The rest of the business remains very strong. We remain strong in France. We've lost business in Spain, but we've gained share because we've lost business at a far slower rate than the market. And Jim, you might want to -- if you want to add anything on to that, please feel free to do so.
James M. Loree: I think when you look at the competitors and their various reports, there's no indication that anything but share loss and share gain at the margin is going on. There is no sweeping trend here. You have the largest competitor in electronic industry shedding some less profitable business. So their numbers are not terribly strong. You have nothing really meaningful going on underneath the 2 of us, the largest and us being the second-largest, and no real meaningful trends with the other electronic players, although there's some noise coming out of a few of them. But thus far, nothing to get too excited or concerned about. In mechanical, I would say that I think we're gaining share in the U.S., and that's a terrific turn of events there. Very recent turn of events, but that's a new business model that we've taken on, certainly seems to be paying some dividends in the early stages. So that's really positive. And then as John mentioned, the European situation, we do have a strong, strong business there, and we're very pleased with it. We have been shedding some business intentionally there, and the market is not terribly strong either. And I think John covered that very thoroughly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: I guess, it's kind of a related question. But I was hoping within the CDIY business, if you could maybe break out expectations domestically versus internationally, if you think about it for the year. And then as it relates to the promotional discussion that you talked about in the first quarter, any help that you can provide on what that impact was on the margin side that will be shifted towards 2Q, 3Q?
John F. Lundgren: Yes. Dennis, this is John. Jeff's going to take all but the very end of your question. We are not going to drill into margins forward-looking by segment or by business. I think we can talk to it arguably directionally. But Jeff, why don't you take those?
Jeffery D. Ansell: As we look at the full year, our expectation is that we'll have -- the North American marketplace will perform essentially at the range we provided, which is mid-single-digit growth with a plus or minus of 1 point either way but around mid-single-digit growth there. Some pressure in Europe, volumes are holding up pretty well as they did last year. But that business continues to be somewhat pressured, offset by strength in the Latin -- or the emerging markets, which will grow double-digits. So if you combine those 3 things, you have strength in emerging markets above our mid-single-digit total range. You have some pressure in Europe, as expected. And North America will perform about at the range of the total business.
John F. Lundgren: And Dennis, just retrospectively to touch on your margin question, as I say, we're just never going to do this prospectively. But we did report strong margins on flat volume. And the math would suggest that was due in part to the delayed promotional activity that Jeff talked about but in equal greater proportion to the strong product mix. Outdoor is a terrific business, but it's not among our highest mix businesses. So less outdoor, less promotion, really strong Professional Power Tool performance certainly helped deliver the very solid margins in the first quarter. Hopefully, that'll help you. Prospectively, we're just not going to go there on this call.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Research: Would you be able to talk about the rate pressures that you saw on CSS, what regions they were in? And also along those lines, how Niscayah is tracking versus your expectation from a sales perspective.
John F. Lundgren: Yes. We'll have Don take it. Mike, we've touched on that, but we'll try to elaborate.
Donald Allan: Yes, Mike. As Jim articulated and I touched a little bit on guidance, CSS is definitely seeing a combination of volume and rate pressure. There's certainly volume pressure in Europe, some of which we anticipated, some of which is a little bit above expectations. But the rate pressure is also in Europe because where we're seeing that volume pressure is in the Nordic region, which is the highest profitable business we have in the European CSS business. We believe it's temporary in nature, but it does require us to accelerate some of the cost synergies that we touched on through the call, and we believe that can quickly get us back to a level of profitability that we're comfortable with. In North America, we have a little bit of rate pressure as we saw some mix shift from larger installed jobs. But that's really us just continuing to focus on the vertical strategy in that business and ensuring that we're achieving the right levels of profitability. And we believe that's a temporary phenomenon, and a lot of that was actually planned for in Q1.
Operator: And our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays.
John Coyle - Barclays Capital, Research Division: It's actually John filling in for Steve today. So in the release, once again you laid out the $15 billion sales target by mid-decade. Clearly, I would think that acquisitions are a big part of that or reaching that. And there are a few potential targets that are being shopped in the market. So I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how you're evaluating M&A and to what extent future tax planning plays in that analysis.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, I'll take that. I guess, 3 points. One is we've said the temporary -- the very publicly announced temporary hiatus in our acquisition program allows us to digest several of the recent acquisitions, particularly Niscayah and Infastech, and focus our efforts both in terms of organizational capacity and to a lesser extent, spending on our organic growth initiatives. That's number one. Number two, we hadn't -- we didn't have -- about 3 years ago, we didn't have Black & Decker on our M&A or BD target, but the opportunity to combine 2 phenomenal businesses with even greater synergies presented itself. And as an opportunistic proactive management team, we seized that opportunity. So that's a long way of saying were that to present itself again, it's not saying we won't do it. Tax planning is a tertiary thought as we look at our M&A and business development plan. Specifically, those who have followed us, we have a very careful screening. Strategically, is it 1 of our 4 identified growth platforms? And then financially, does it achieve our hurdles? Last but not least, do we have the organizational capacity to absorb it? All 3 of those things go into our thinking and our planning. And it will continue as this year progresses. We haven't in the past nor will we ever talk about specific targets. But this company -- acquisition, valuation and integration is or is rapidly becoming a recognized core competency in this company. And we've been given a lot of credit for that. We haven't forgotten how to do it. Long term, it will remain part of our strategy. But temporarily, it's on the back burner.
James M. Loree: And if I could just elaborate as well. We come at M&A more from a strategic point of view than we do trying to fill in some goal that we have for the mid-decade. So we're not out there just willy-nilly shopping around so we can get to $15 billion. What we do believe is that with the capital allocation approach that we have and with the revenue growth objectives that we have, which would be low double-digits total growth and then 4% to 6% organic long-term objectives, that we can get to something along the lines of $15 billion by the middle of the decade using our very publicly stated acquisition strategy, which is to continue to consolidate the tool industry, number one, which means strengthening our CDIY and IAR businesses through investments, and particular -- in this particular market, the accessories is the area that we really are underrepresented in. It's the most profitable area in the power tool business. And it's one where we're constantly looking for opportunities. These would tend to be bolt-ons in this particular space, but we will continue to pursue those. And then the other area that we're focused on is in emerging markets for the tool business because there's plenty of opportunity to continue to complement our organic growth strategy in tools with an acquisitive growth strategy. So protect the core through M&A, protect the tool business. And then we move to the growth platforms. And we have 4 growth platforms. We have Security, Engineered Fastening, Infrastructure and Healthcare. We'll start with Healthcare because we're only $170 million in Healthcare today, and we're not going to go out and buy a multi-hundred million dollar healthcare business that trades at 4, 5x revenue. That's just not what we're going to do. Healthcare, we may do some small technology bolt-ons that could help improve our value proposition, where we bring efficiency and safety and security to hospitals. But the other 3 areas are the ones that you'll likely to see M&A activity in the future. Engineered Fastening, we just completed one, so I wouldn't expect anything too soon there. And then you have Security and you have Infrastructure. Well, as you know, the Security businesses, those folks are busy digesting Niscayah and also getting their organic growth on track. So they probably won't be doing anything significant in the near term. However, as we look further out, I would expect to see some activity in the emerging markets and perhaps some activity targeted at industry verticals, such as retail, financial services, government, et cetera. And then finally, Infrastructure. And we will continue to see plenty of opportunities in Infrastructure, where we can find niche positions that are in secular growing areas that can be defended, that have high margins and high growth associated with them. So we would probably see some activity in that area on a prospective basis. But as we said last July, 12 to 18 months hiatus. Well, we're coming up on July, we've made some good progress, but we will not continue acquisition strategy above and beyond emerging markets until we get to the point where we can say definitively that the organic growth initiatives are working.
Operator: And our next question comes from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: I see the investment in the discussion on organic growth across the business. I'm curious how you're balancing this thinking in the Security business, trying to grow Security, improve organic growth share there, while at the same time you're taking cost out. So if you could just talk a little bit about how you're balancing the spending there and especially thinking about Niscayah with the market share and the growth objectives.
John F. Lundgren: Yes. I think it's fairly simple. I think when you look at the model, Eric, the North American business, we are investing for growth right now. And the European business, we are rightsizing the cost structure to reflect the revenue reality. So that's where you see the cost out, the synergy increases, is all in Europe. And in North America, we're investing significantly in vertical markets, in particular, the vertical market growth strategy. But it's as simple as that. It's a bifurcated approach.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: And if I could just follow up, the assumption for the year sounds like you expect to make up the margin shortfall in that business through the rest of the year. What changes in 2Q to 4Q relative to 1Q, especially in light of the investments you're making?
John F. Lundgren: Yes, I think I'll take it. Jim can elaborate if he'd like. I touched on that in my comments, and I'll try to clarify. Two things. Obviously, Niscayah increased synergies in and of themselves will make up mathematically for some of the volume shortfall and some of the margin shortfall. Again the Niscayah synergies get -- they get greater every quarter, the run rate not smaller. Second, Jim alluded to it in his segment discussion. We've modified our, if you will, go-to-market approach via distribution in North America on the mechanical side of the business. And early signs are it's been tremendously successful. And we think that's going to continue. A lot of other moving parts. And as Don talked about the total company, within Security, Brett would talk about a lot of puts and calls that are neutral. But strong Mechanical Security business, as well as Access business getting stronger and continuing to put a lot of points on the board from Niscayah's cost synergies, we do believe will get us back to where we've been. And Eric, you've followed this business a long time, it historically has been a very, very profitable business. And the math with Niscayah was low -- very low single-digit operating margin when we acquired it. It is double-digit operating margin, and it's going to get to fleet average within a year or so, and that's just a really big piece of it.
James M. Loree: Yes. And I know that when we talk about investments in verticals, it sounds kind of generic and it doesn't really have a lot of life to it. But when you start talking about the individual verticals and what we can bring to the -- what we can and are bringing to the market right now, it's very obvious that we have solutions that are differentiated in a number of these verticals. Just take K-12, for example, where we have the full array of mechanical, electromechanical and electronic solutions to bring to a K-12 scenario. And every school board in the United States is evaluating their security right now. We have deployed an army of people around that opportunity. That will come to fruition at some point in time. We are the best positioned security company in America to deal with that opportunity. In financial services, we have the best iris identification technology in the world, exclusive rights to the best iris identification technology. We're in discussions with major financial institutions about how we help them create branches that are keyless branches using iris identification technology. At some point, that will likely come to fruition. And I could go on and on. In retail, what we're doing in retail, what we're doing with government, what we're doing with the RTLS technology that we acquired from AeroScout. But if you start to really delve into these solutions, our opportunity at this point is to commercialize them. And that's what the Security people are focused on, and that's why we're investing in North American Security. And oh, by the way, once we get these solutions nailed down in North America, the next wave after that is going to be to take them to Europe. So right now, we're getting Europe rightsized, so it's profitable and robust, and we have strong management team in place, which we're well on our way to doing. And then a year or 2 from now, there will be a wave of solutions, these same solutions coming into Europe. And then finally, we're investing in the emerging markets in Security. Our business this year will be about $100 million in Security in the emerging markets. The Tong Lung acquisition, which was quietly done, and the GMP [ph] acquisition, which was done several years ago, have really provided us with outstanding manufacturing and design capability. And we recently completed a series of EN products, which are the European-type standard products that play much more successfully into the emerging markets. Now we have Chinese manufacturing capability. We have Taiwan design capability. And all of that is being assembled for our frontal attack on several of the major emerging markets. So growth in Security is coming and investments are being made. And it's an exciting time, I think, for the Security business. But we're at the threshold of it at this point.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA.
Jeremie Capron - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Just a question on the Hand Tools business. You talked about strong performance of the new DeWalt line. So I wonder what is it that is actually holding it back over the past couple of quarters and if you had any comments on market share around this.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, certainly. Jeremie, as indicated, the power tool brand usage in our Hand Tool business has really been positive, while the core Stanley business remains very strong globally. The challenge -- and from a share perspective, we believe our share has increased in Hand Tools over the past 3 years. So from a share perspective, quite positive. Introduction of power tool brands, our power tool brands at Hand Tools have been predominantly incremental. The pressure that business has faced in the past quarter and probably past couple of quarters is high exposures -- relatively high exposure to Europe, which is a strong hand tool market for us that really has been pressured in that business like every other. So that really has offset some of the growth we've had from a power tool brand perspective in our Hand Tool business. But we continue to make progress from a share perspective. And we expect, too, that business will grow consistent with the rest of the business as guided already for the remainder of 2013.
Operator: And our next question comes from Liam Burke from Janney.
Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: You highlighted margin synergies. And with a few exceptions, you seem to be on track both from a revenue and margin side. CapEx is roughly in line in the 2% to 3%. Are you comfortable that you're making the progress you need to meet your ROCE target of 15% or objective of 15%?
Donald Allan: Yes, this is Don. I would say yes, we are comfortable. I think we had mentioned, I believe, back in January that one of the, if you want to call it, a benefit of us taking this temporary tactical pause around M&A is that it allows us to focus on enhancing our return on capital employed. Because what you've seen over the last 5 years, in particular, or even before that, as we did acquisitions, that before they get integrated into our existing core businesses, they have a lower return and they get to the range of 12% to 15% return on capital employed by somewhere between year 3 through 5 post acquisition. That's been a bit of a, if you want to call it, drag on that overall return of the company. But still the return of the company has been around 10% in that time frame, which is certainly significantly above our cost of capital. But we wanted to be closer to 15%, as you mentioned, by the middle of this decade. This pause allows us to make a lot of progress. We think we can make about 100 to 150 basis point improvement this year. The other great benefit of the organic growth initiatives over the next 3 years is minimal investment to make that happen. And a return of $200 million of operating margin by year 3 really does gives us a dramatic boost on those returns as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Peter Lisnic from Robert Baird.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just on the positive trends you noted on the business model shift at Mechanical Access. Can you give us a little flavor as to how that translates into maybe a margin progression this year but more importantly what that means longer-term for the business from a return perspective? And potentially, does it enhance the growth aspects of the platform as well?
John F. Lundgren: Yes. Peter, I'll say for the third time this morning, we're not going to project margins by subsegment of business going forward. It does us no good and we don't -- we're not sure it helps you that much. I understand the desire from a modeling perspective. What we can say, and I think Jim articulated this quite well, we were slow to shift our model because we had something that was working. But it absolutely will be a catalyst for more organic growth in the North American Mechanical Security market. We were missing a lot of opportunity in terms of both specification and with mid-price point products with our purely direct model, which served the high end extremely well and the restocking captive customers extremely well. But it left us a little void in a lot of areas where we felt it was absolutely essential we have greater penetration to grow the market. So at the end of the day, a better mid-price -- a mid-price point product offering, broader distribution will absolutely be a stimulus for organic growth. And we would not do it if we didn't think it was going to be incremental or positive vis-à-vis margins. But we're certainly not going to forecast that for one small segment of one segment of our business.
James M. Loree: Yes, it's an interesting time when you look at what's going on in distribution in Mechanical Security because these distributors, as they went through tough times, they sort of doubled down on growth and driving organic growth themselves and really started pushing the envelope up into the electromechanical and even into electronic, in some cases. So our business model plays very, very nicely into that trend. And the second thing I would say is while we were farming our installed base very effectively, the armies of distributors that are out there that are hunting in the commercial construction area are absolutely winning that war. And so therefore, if you don't play in that arena with them, you don't get the opportunity to participate in the commercial construction growth that's ahead of us. And so there's several other reasons for doing what we did, but those are 2 good ones.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeffrey Kessler from Imperial Capital.
Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: And speaking of Mechanical Security, at the ISC show, you demonstrated, what may not be your first but it was certainly the first that I saw it demonstrated, integrated a [indiscernible] a networked mechanical door that would be networked with CSS. Can you speak a little bit about the, if you want to call it, the convergence of getting your mechanical and your electronic businesses together particularly at the door?
James M. Loree: Yes. I mean, that's definitely a thrust of ours. You saw the product, that is going to be the first of...
Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: I think it was like the ESA [ph] to the ELA [ph], or something like that.
James M. Loree: Yes. It's called the EL. The EL lock, which will be introduced en masse in May to the marketplace, was kind of spotlighted at the show. And it'll be at a price point that no one else can even get near. And that's with sourced manufacturing to begin with, that can be brought in-house if we so desire at some point. But yes, that's a key part of our strategy. It certainly plays to many of the verticals that we're looking at. It also gives us quite an edge with respect to what I was just talking about with the independent distributors and the fact that they are moving into the electromechanical and electronic realm. And that comes in both a networked and a non-networked version. And we're expecting pretty good big things. I didn't really talk about that as part of the equation for Mechanical Security growth as we go forward, but that's certainly out there as something that can help drive it.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Great. Well, I think that wraps us up, Lorraine, correct?
Operator: That is correct. I am showing no further questions.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Well, thank you, all, so much for dialing in today. If you have any questions, please just send me an e-mail or give me a call, and I'll talk to you all soon. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q4 and Full Year 2012 Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lorraine, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Kate Vanek. Ms. Vanek, you may begin.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Thanks, Lorraine. Good morning, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us for the Stanley Black & Decker Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR portion of our website as well as our newly revamped iPhone and iPad app and mobile website. A replay of the call will begin today at 2:00 p.m. The replay number and access code are in our release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's 2012 fourth quarter and full year results and various other topical matters, followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As always, please feel free to contact me with any sort of follow-up questions. And as I normally have to do: We will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may or may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act. With that, I will now turn the -- our call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody. Listen, this morning, beyond reporting our fourth quarter '12 results and providing our 2013 guidance, which I know everyone on the call is interested in, a couple of other objectives of this morning's call are to essentially close the books on the Black & Decker merger and, of equal or even greater importance, lay the groundwork for what we believe is a series of really exciting organic growth initiatives. So thanks for joining us early this morning. Quickly, on the fourth quarter. Revenues were up 4%, to $2.7 billion. Half of that was organic growth, up 2%. And very interesting, on the organic growth, 6% in CDIY and Engineered Fastening, 2 of our strategic businesses performing really well, and those were -- that growth was offset by declines in Europe due primarily to market conditions in IAR as well as Security. A little more on that later. Diluted EPS of $1.37, combination of strong operations and a favorable tax rate. That was up 12% versus same period a year ago. GAAP earnings of 70 -- were $0.79. Full year revenues, up 8%, 2% organically. And 2012 EPS of $4.67, x charges, was flat versus prior year. But if you normalize the tax rate, i.e., equal -- 2012, make it equal to 2011, diluted EPS GAAP was $2.70 but, with a normalized tax rate, would have been a 12% increase year-on-year. And Don is going to provide a lot more granularity on tax and its progression '11, '12 to '13 when he gives you some more detail on the outlook. Strong year in cash flow, $1.1 billion, x charges, for the year. Working capital turns of 7.5, a 42% increase since the pro forma pre-merger levels. 2013 guidance for diluted earnings of $5.40 to $5.65 a share. That's a 16% to 21% increase versus 2012, driven by organic growth in the range of 2% to 3%, 100 basis points of which we believe will be driven by the early returns on some of the organic growth initiatives that Jim is going to walk you through a little later on this morning. And finally, March 2013 marks the 3-year anniversary of the merger between Stanley and Black & Decker. It's an important milestone. It came with a few notable executive management changes, and those were announced in a press release on January 14 and they're taking effect during the first quarter of this year. So let's turn to the final chapter of the merger. And I guess it's both a pleasure and my good fortune to be able to talk about it at least on this call this morning and it's probably the last time we'll talk about it in any particular detail. But let's wrap it up. We did really well on cost synergies. By the end of 2013, we will have achieved $500 million in cost synergies, significantly exceeding our target and commitment of $350 million. We've exceeded that target by 43%. As you all know, CDIY right now represents about 50% of our revenue. The $760 million in CDIY of operating margin in 2012 exceeded the entire 2009 operating margin of the entire company, legacy Stanley and legacy Black & Decker combined. That's the impact of cost and revenue synergies, a prolific new product development activity in process and exceptionally strong execution by the CDIY team led by Jeff Ansell and comprised of really the best athletes from each of the 2 legacy organizations. So it was just a terrific opportunity, and thankfully, in retrospect, we were able to take advantage of it. Revenue energy projects continue to yield strong results. We've surpassed $300 million in revenue synergies versus a goal of $300 million to $400 million. And probably the simple example, just to refresh everyone's memory, Stanley Hand Tools are up $25 million in Latin America -- or will be by the end of 2013. Business was virtually nonexistent but -- as we were able to sell premium-branded Stanley products through a well-established Black & Decker distribution network. It's just one of many, many examples of how the -- of the power of the combination of these 2 companies. The cultures, driven by world-class innovation, have resulted in more than 1,500 new products and $1 billion of organic growth over the last 3 years. And probably one of the greatest achievements in terms of results from the combination is the degree to which the Stanley Fulfillment System has been initially embraced and fully embedded across the 2 companies. Working capital turns were 7.5, up from 5.3 pro forma pre-merger levels. And within CDIY, which is where the majority of the integration activity went on, working capital is down 50% from the 2009 pre-merger levels. That is a lot of freed-up cash to reinvest in our businesses. So by all measures, we truly believe the merger to date has been a resounding success. Let's move on to the quarter. In terms of sources of growth, as you saw in our earnings release this morning, Stanley grew 4% in the fourth quarter, 8% for the year. Of the 4% in the fourth quarter, it was 2% organic, which was 2% volume and flat on price. Acquisitions added 3%. Currency was a 100-basis-point headwind, for a total of 4%. Quite similar to how it played out for the year, where volume was up 2%, price was flat, leading to 2% organic growth. Acquisitions added 8%. Currency was a 200-basis-point headwind, and that yields the 8% total growth. Looking quickly by business, to give everyone a flavor for the fourth quarter and the year. Exceptional performance of Professional Power Tools in the quarter and on the year, driven by the 18- and 20-volt lithium-ion DeWalt product introductions, just tremendously well accepted across our customer base. The Consumer Products Group also had a terrific fourth quarter and a great year. The fourth quarter 9% was driven primarily by new products, Gyro and Matrix, as well as some really good acceptance of some of the smaller products in Japan, which is a small but important market where that business continues to perform well. Engineered Fastening, another bright spot, up 6% for the quarter, 9% for the year. MAS commercial, up 3% for the quarter, reversing a trend where they were down on a year-to-date basis. Hand tools and fastening was flat for the quarter, 2% for the year. Europe actually grew but offset in -- by the U.S., where we made the conscious decision to exit some lower-margin businesses in hand tools and fasteners. Infrastructure, down 2% in the quarter, 6% for the year. The primary driver there was our oil and gas business, where the onshore business was slow across the board, offset partially by strong growth, albeit from a low base, in the offshore business, and Jim is going to talk about that a little bit in his section a little later on. Quickly, convergent security was off 3% for the quarter and for the year. U.S. Security actually grew in the fourth quarter. Most of the decline was Europe, and a lot of that was Niscayah, much of which was planned. And finally, last but certainly not least, IAR was down 5% for the quarter, 2% for the year. You will recall that IAR is one of our few businesses where we have more business in Europe than the U.S., due to the extremely important FACOM franchise, among others. That franchise is stronger than ever. I won't dwell on European market conditions, but we've -- we have, at a minimum, maintained and likely gained share in Europe by being off only 2% for the year in our Industrial & Automotive Repair business. So the key organic growth initiatives are in process, we're going to expand on this, and a couple programs in place to rev up the engine for a couple of our smaller businesses that are lagging fleet average in terms of performance. Let's look real quickly on a geographic basis. I don't want to spend too much time on this. But upper left, if we want to look at North America, very strong quarter in Canada and a very good year. More importantly, the U.S., which accounts for 48% to 49% of our business, grew 1% in the quarter, 1% for the year. CDIY and Security were up, offset by the Industrial segment, as we've talked about on an ongoing basis. Moving to the middle of the chart. Europe was off 3% in the quarter, 2% for the year. It does represent 26% of our business. Again, in the fourth quarter, CDIY grew, whilst convergent security, primarily Niscayah, as well as IAR were off in the fourth quarter. So a total of 3% organic volume decline, 2% for the year. Emerging markets remained -- go from strength to strength: a plus 15% quarter, 11% for the year. And then just very, very quickly, Japan and Australia together account for 4% of our business. Japan, a flat quarter but very strong year, driven by Engineered Fastening. And Australia was down high single digits. We think we have a program in place to leverage the opportunity to improve collaboration between IAR, CDIY, as well as leverage the infrastructure of backroom abilities with Stanley Security Solutions. Let me turn it over to Jim, who's going to spend a little less time than normal on segment detail. And we've included a great amount of detail in the appendix so that you can spend a little more time on introducing some of the growth initiatives to which I've spoken.
James M. Loree: Okay. Thanks, John. As John indicated, I'll hit the segment info fairly quickly. It is a fairly clear and relatively simple story this quarter, operationally. And the first part of the story, relating to CDIY, is just a terrific performance by that team, with a 6% organic growth and 180 basis points of profit rate accretion. The organic growth was 7% in North America. We had double-digit growth in the emerging markets and we were flat in Europe. Now of all those accomplishments, I would say the last one perhaps was the most challenging to deal with and perhaps the most impressive because they were able to take what in Southern Europe was a down 10% to 20% type of performance across those countries and translate it into an overall flat performance. Really outstanding work in the U.K. and real strong in other parts of Europe, excluding the south as well. So they've taken the new products and they've done some really creative promotions, and they've really worked hard to offset the difficult market conditions in Europe. And now moving to the global business. The Professional Power Tools, up 14%, as John mentioned; consumer, up 9%; hand tools and fastening was flat, as new storage products and Black & Decker Hand Tools strengths were offset by lower U.S. sales as we exited some dilutive-margin promotion activity that we had engaged in last year. What's really impressive to me is the profit rate, 14.5% in the fourth quarter. That's really strong for the fourth quarter for this type of business. And as you will probably recall, the margin rates have been pretty strong in CDIY all year. And we think that -- as we enter 2013 with strong organic growth momentum, that we have a new watermark for operating margin rate that represents a sustainable -- we think, sustainable level, with perhaps room for even further improvement. In the home market, that's firming up as we sit here today, and a solid new product pipeline so we're pretty bullish on this segment for the future. And then moving to Security and Industrial. The story is -- it was articulated as basically weakness in Europe in both these businesses negatively impacted the growth and profitability in the segments. Security had negative 3% organic growth and positive growth, if -- albeit 1%, but still a sea change in terms of performance in CSS North America and we're happy to see that. Minus 5% in Europe. And the Mechanical Access business, which is primarily U.S., was up 3%. The operating margin rate in Security was 15.5%, essentially flat, down 20 basis points versus the prior year; and 17.3%, excluding the Niscayah dilution that -- or rate dilution that occurs because of the lower rate. Although, the Niscayah integration is continuing to progress smoothly and they've essentially doubled their operating margin rate since the inception of that integration activity. CSS overall was down 3% organically: North America up 1% and minus 5% in Europe. And as I mentioned, the Commercial Hardware organic sales were up, in total, 3%; and in North America, 4%. We have a very interesting business model shift going on in Mechanical Access in the U.S., and that is that we're converting our direct business to be served by independent distributors, which is freeing up our sales force for -- from the transactional activity to become much more hunters, hunter-type activity. And also, this change enables us to really pursue more aggressively the commercial construction market, which is heating up as we speak. So that's the story for Security. Industrial, 16% operating margin rate, down 40 basis points versus the prior year. The operating leverage in Engineered Fastening continuing great performance there, offset by the declines in IAR Europe. And John talked about the numbers, with IAR down 5% organically, Engineered Fastening up 6% and infrastructure down 2%, for a total of negative 1% organic growth. Engineered Fastening at 6% positive was a good, really good, story when you put it in the context of the light vehicle production globally, which contracted 1.5%. And they also had a terrific performance in Europe, being up 3% despite the issues on that continent. And they also -- the team at Emhart also made terrific progress planning for the Infastech integration, which we expect to -- the deal to close here over the next several weeks. So all that, very encouraging. The infrastructure business. The declines moderated, so trend is getting better there. And actually, oil and gas, that -- the larger part of the segment there -- or the subsegment was slightly positive organically, reflecting what we think is a bottom in the U.S. onshore market, which is very encouraging. In fact, we see activity beginning to become -- pipeline activity beginning to generate very significant activity in the -- North America. And then offshore remained strong. The issue in -- that made the subsegment negative was the hydraulics business was down about 10%, relying heavily on -- end market relying heavily on scrap steel, which was a tough story in the latter half of the year. So that's the segment information for this quarter. Now I'd like to spend some time on the initiative that we as a team have been aggressively pursuing for about 6 months now. And we think the #1 catalyst for positive reevaluation of the company in the stock market will be the demonstrated capacity of this team to achieve 4% to 6% organic growth, which has been a long-standing objective of ours ever since John's arrival. And if you average out the organic growth over the long term, we've been running around 3%, if you exclude 2009, which was a kind of an outlier of a year. It will be about 1% if you included '09. So we haven't really hit that objective. And if you look at the last 5 years, there's lots of external factors that have been attributable to that. However, we cannot accept the fact that the external environment, a, has been weak; and we cannot accept the lower performance just because the external environment has been weak. And we don't really expect the external environment to be much better over the next 5 years, with continued issues in Europe, slow growth in the U.S. and maybe somewhat slower but still robust growth in the emerging markets. So as a team, we've decided that we would take matters into our own hands and we would rev up our organic growth engine. And a lot of the acquisition activity that we've pursued over the last few years has put us in a position where we're actually able to do that, leveraging some of the value propositions that we've acquired and capabilities that we've acquired over the years. So we have an initiative, I've talked about it before, which adds up internally to slightly over $1 billion of revenue over a 3-year period. We're going to commit to $850 million, which would give us the ability to tack on a couple of points of organic growth, on top of the 1 to 2 to 3 that we kind of expect attributable to all our other activities and our core activities in these relatively slow markets. So that's how we're going to get to 4% to 6%. We're going to have these incremental activities that require some significant funding and a lot of execution. So about $100 million of operating expense investment over the 3-year period, with about $65 million of it this year and about $50 million of onetime CapEx, is the price for implementing these programs. I'm going to talk about emerging markets, which is the single largest element of the $850 million, at $350 million. But first let me just quickly cover some of the other ones that add up to the other part of this major initiative. Very exciting is the smart tools and storage element. It's about $100 million; includes MRO vending, tool-locating systems, electronic can bonds [ph]. It leverages our CribMaster and AeroScout acquisitions. And we've -- we're in the process now of adding about 40 sales executives, primarily in the U.S. but also in some other areas around the world. That's under way and looking very, very positive. $150 million will come from health care and security verticals. The acquisition of Niscayah and AeroScout enable us to take a whole new approach to health care where we can bring safety, security, efficiency and compliance to hospitals at a time when they sorely need it and, in many cases, are desperate for improvements in these areas. It's just for health of their enterprises. And we have the value proposition which is very, very powerful and we've really developed it at this point in time. And now it's incumbent upon us to take it to the market and start selling it. And so we are adding about 75 account executives in health care and education, which is also, obviously, in the security vertical, a very, very relevant place to be right now. And these -- the hiring of these folks is well under way. The value propositions are intact and I'm very confident that we'll get to the $150 million. Then on the U.S. government. You might ask, why go into the U.S. government right now when the spending looks like it's going to go down about somewhere in the neighborhood of 5% to 10%? But the reality is, as the -- as we look back in our market share with the U.S. government over time, we're kind of underweight in this area and we haven't attacked it in a very efficient manner over the years. And so what we're finding is that we need to have feet on the street at the locations where things are actually purchased by the government and not necessarily just in Washington. So we are putting about 20 people on the street to cover U.S. government in the regional areas, with focus on California, the South and Virginia. And we expect the U.S. government sales to increase by about $100 million over a 3-year period. And that will cover several of our different businesses, including CDIY, IAR, the security business and health care. And then we have offshore. Offshore today has already been a great story, somewhat masked by the weakness in onshore which, as I mentioned, is now subsiding. And offshore is going to continue to grow. It's about $100 million today. It was about $20 million when we bought CRC. And the latest chapter in that exciting story will have to do with 2 things and primary things. One is building portable spool bases, which is a -- kind of a revolutionary idea that our CRC folks came up with which helps the pipeline company save enormous amounts of money by moving the spool bases to where the oil is, as opposed to just the fixed spool bases that exist today. And then the other area is a major push into Malaysia, where the offshore activity has increased dramatically over the last few years. And we're in discussions now with the major producers, pipeline companies in that area to implement a major growth program there. And then the final part of this is just finishing up the Black & Decker revenue synergies. As John mentioned, we're closing the book on the merger today, so we won't be talking about that much more. But we didn't want to lose sight of the last $50 million that -- of revenue synergies that we have planned for that and so we'll just track it and manage it using the process that we're using here to drive this organic growth engine. And that process is basically taking the integration approach that we used so successfully over the years for our various acquisitions. And using that kind of program management, resource allocation, tracking, monitoring, pulsing-type of an approach to ensure that we manage this organic growth initiative as tightly, as we did those various acquisition integrations. And that is under way, and so far so good. We feel real confident that we know what the status of each one of these initiatives is and that, if we do run into issues, that we'll know quickly and be able to respond quickly. So all of these initiatives are up and running. We will generate a minimum of $100 million of organic growth, as a result of them, in 2012, and then another $350 million to $400 million a year for the following 2 years after that. And the thought is that once we get through this that we will have made enormous progress, just like we did with the Stanley Fulfillment System, in making this organic growth part of the fabric of the company and therefore changing the inherent structural organic growth rate of the company up into that 4% to 6% range, which we think will have enormous value creation potential for the equity. So let's move on to a little bit more color on what we're doing in the emerging markets. And this is really a major step function change in the way that we're approaching emerging markets. Historically, we've managed the various regions of the world as very -- tight P&L's, with incremental investments generally made at the local level, monitored by the businesses, with input from the businesses, but because of the tight P&L management and, most of these initiatives, when you make the investments, the payback is greater than 1 year, so any time that there were external market issues or that type of thing, there was frequently kind of pulling back on the incremental investment. And we still -- despite the fact that we only made incremental investment, we still have terrific growth from the emerging markets. And today, they represent about 15% of the company. They typically have grown over the last 5 years about 20%. Last year was slightly lower than that as they have slowed down a little, but they continue to be major growth drivers. They continue to have above-line-average operating margins. So roughly in the neighborhood of 20%. It will be -- operating margin will go down slightly as we make some major funding commitments, but it will still be well above company line average. So we have funded a major push. As I mentioned, the totals that we're spending this year will be about $65 million. And a good half of that -- slightly more than half of that will be spent on the emerging markets where we're going to add about 1,000 commercial resources over the next 3 years. And that, as I said, is well under way. We're also moving the management of these various markets from a business-led center of gravity with, generally speaking, U.S. headquarters to a regional-led center of gravity led by one individual, who was appointed in the fourth quarter, Jaime Ramirez, who ran our Latin American business for -- first with Black & Decker and then with Stanley Black & Decker and grew it from $200 million to about $900 million over an 8-year period. He is a proven veteran who has aggressive growth track record and also strong profitability management and people management. So he's the right guy, he's on board. He's about 4 months into – or, excuse me, 3 months into his planning process. He's got his organization assembled, and we're off and running. We're also moving from high-price-point Western-designed products, which only cover about 10% to 20% of the market, to mid-price-point products, which will be designed locally, which address about 70% of the market. Now the high-price-point products will continue to sell because over time we'd like to move our MPP customers up into the high-price-point products. But that -- the heartland of the market right now in the emerging markets is the MPP. And these products need to be designed locally by local engineers who are in touch with local market customs and local market needs. So we have formed 3 renew SBUs with global emerging markets responsibility because one thing we have found is that, although there are nuances from region to region, many of the products across all these markets are very, very similar. And so at late-point identification, we can have a relatively streamlined product structure. And those 3 SBUs are in power tools, hand tools and Commercial Hardware. And then the other thing that we're going to do is we're going to go from a limited MPP line, which we talked about, but we're -- much of which is sourced, and we're going to go to a much more of an in-house manufactured line in the emerging markets and for the emerging markets, with local plants that are dedicated to local markets. We can't have high-cost plants that serve the West, even though they're located in the emerging markets, serve the local markets because we can't get to the right cost structure. So we will have several new plants. We started that with the opening of an Indian plant last year. And we'll have plants in China and Turkey. We'll expand our plant in Brazil. And we'll continue to build plants as necessary as the volume begins to build up. This will not require enormous capital expenditures. There will be a combination of small acquisitions and relatively small capital expenditures for these plants. We're also moving from an under-resourced commercial organization in the emerging markets to a very significant troop movement, with feet on the street sized to the market opportunity and over 1,000 commercial resources to be added. And you might say, "Well, that -- what does that mean in the context of what you have now?" And it will be more than doubling the resources that we have in those markets today. So, just to give you some context. And then finally, we're going from separate CDIY and IAR efforts in Tools and Storage to one unified effort focused on growth. Now as a company, we are the only one with power tools and hand tools. We're also the only tool company with strength in both the CDIY and the IAR channels. And it's very interesting, when you get into these markets, the channels become very blurred between CDIY and IAR. So instead of spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to take our structure and account for it and manage it in a way that isn't a natural fit with the markets, we're going to leverage the advantages that we have, the power tools, the hand tools, the CDIY, the IAR. And we've constructed an internal JV, which will take the best elements of CDIY's aspects and IAR's and it will be managed by the leader of the region. And there'll be no time wasted on internal things like trying to sort out who gets credit for what, it will simply be focused on growing in the marketplace, which will help us drive these powerful results. So this is a pivotal moment in our company's evolution, in my view. I think in the past we've demonstrated prowess in cost control, acquisition, integration, deal execution, working capital management, so on. But as I mentioned earlier, our organic growth has been okay but not superior, not an outperformance, let's say, for what it could be. And that's despite the fact that we've more than quadrupled the size of the company over the last 10 years, and now we're going to add organic growth to the fabric of our culture. And I think it'll be a very, very positive thing for our employees and our stockholders. I'll turn it over to Don now for the rest of the financial presentation.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. So I'd like to start with a review of free cash flow on Page 13. As you can see, our free cash flow performance was very strong in 2012. One thing I would like to highlight, though, is this financial statement is a little different than what you've seen in the P&L, which excludes HHI. The cash flow statement actually has the impact of HHI in it for the majority of the year. However, it does not reflect the full year cash flow performance for HHI because we did close the transaction in the early to mid-December. And as a result, there's roughly $30 million of loss in cash flow associated with HHI. So when you adjust for that, our performance was about $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion, and compared to the $1.60 billion (sic) [$1.06 billion] that you see here on the page. One thing I would like to point out as well is that our working capital performance, as John mentioned, was very, very strong, up to 7.5 from 7.2 in the prior year, which generated in the fourth quarter almost $350 million of free cash flow. It was slightly short of our expectation. We expected it to be slightly above $400 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned back in October. And naturally, the gap that you see, the $1.1 billion versus our guidance of $1.2 billion. That, all set aside, is fantastic performance in free cash flow overall, 2 years in a row in excess of $1 billion, and it continues to be a strong part of the story for our company. Couple of items to note as well here on this page. There's a large gain associated with HHI that's included here, and we're actually backing that out. So it's included in that income and then it's backed out so it doesn't affect the operating cash flow. A very tax-efficient transaction selling HHI, which I think most of you are aware of. The growth -- the pretax gain was almost $390 million, and the tax effect -- or effective tax rate was $25 million. So a very nice story there, with less than 10% tax paid on the gain associated with that transaction. And then the last item to mention would be our CapEx. CapEx was relatively in-line, about 2.5% of our revenue for the year. And we would expect that, going into 2013, we'd see a similar trend in the percentage of revenue as well. So the last takeaway on free cash flow is that we feel this is definitely a differentiator for our company. We'll continue to focus on working capital improvement, going forward. As you know, we have a road to get to 10 working capital turns, and we still feel there's many areas of improvement that are available in our businesses. So with that, I'd like to move to 2013 outlook. For EPS, we expect to be between $5.40 and $5.65 for the year, which would be a 16% to 21% EPS growth versus 2012. Let me walk you through some of the assumptions associated with that. First, organic growth. Organic growth, we expect to be up 2% to 3%, which would be an accretive impact in EPS of anywhere from $0.00 to $0.15. Breaking that down into a little more detail: The core businesses, we would expect to grow somewhere between 1% to 2%, so relatively consistent with the performance that we saw in 2012, which adds accretion of $0.15 to $0.30 EPS. As Jim touched on briefly, the organic growth initiatives will yield about 1 point of revenue in 2013. However, they will be slightly dilutive to EPS, $0.15 specifically, as we make investments to ensure that we can achieve $850 million of revenue in 3 years and $200 million of operating margin in that same time frame. It's more of a timing issue and it's something just to be cognizant as we make these investments and ensure that we're successful over the next 3 years with this growth initiative. The next area would be cost synergies associated with 2 -- our 2 larger acquisitions, BDK and Niscayah. As we close the book on BDK, we do still have some revenue synergies, that Jim touched on, to execute on in 2013 as well. It's $50 million of cost synergies. That will have a cumulative effect of $500 million of BDK cost synergies and really close the book on that transaction. $35 million of Niscayah synergies, which is year 2. And we continue to progress forward with really trying to achieve an OM rate above line average for Niscayah within our Security segment. $0.20 EPS accretion associated with Infastech. So it's slightly better than the $0.15 that we provided 3 months ago. We -- the transaction has not closed at this point. We do expect that it likely will close, hopefully before February 1. But if for some reason that doesn't happen due to the regulatory approval process, in China specifically, then we'll provide an update accordingly as needed. Carryover effect of our cost actions from 2012, we expect to be $0.15, which is slightly lower than our October view as we've allowed some customer-facing headcount and TD adds to come back into the system to make sure that we drive organic growth. The next area is associated with the share repurchase. So as you know, a large part of the funds of -- with the HHI divestiture, we’re going to utilized to repurchase shares. We entered into an accelerated share repurchase program in early December that was executed on post the closing of HHI. As a result, approximately 80% of the $850 million share repurchase, which is up from the $700 million we originally communicated, was executed on in late December. Then as a result, 9.3 million shares were retired associated with that at a cost that's in the low 70s from a stock price perspective. The remainder of the 20% of the $850 million will be executed on in the second quarter, with the total EPS impact will be a positive $0.37 for 2013, resulting in an average shares outstanding, as you can see, of 155.9 million. Then we have several other areas that net to a neutral impact that we touched on before such as FX, prices inflation -- pricing inflation, the negative mix carryover effect that we experienced in 2012 and then some positive impacts from some smaller acquisitions such as Powers, AeroScout, et cetera. All that will be net neutral to 2013. The next area is tax, and I'd like to clarify a few things in tax, especially related to 2012, before I walk through the guidance. Our tax rate in 2012 for the year was 19.8%. That's on a continuing operations basis. If you include HHI in our results for the year, the tax rate would've been 22%, which is right in line with our guidance of 22% to 23% that we provided in January and reinforced throughout the year, as well as in October. The Q4 associated rate with that 22% was 17%, again in line with our expectations. So I just want to make sure I clarify that because there were a few questions earlier this morning related to the tax rate in 2012, which was in line with our guidance expectations. So what does that mean going into 2013? Well, we do expect our tax rate to increase in 2013 to 23% to 24%, which does create a headwind in EPS, as you can see, of $0.20 to $0.30. Why is that? Well, in the last 2 years, we've had some significant tax audit settlements in 2011. Those settlements were over $100 million, $105 million specifically. And in 2012, they were approximately $42 million. When you adjust the effect of those onetime items, the tax rate is between 23% and 24% for those years, which is really the new base for us going forward. We've settled a lot of the old years associated with tax audits and we are current now. And we don't expect to have large settlements as we move forward. And it's a good base rate for our company as you model it into the future. And then the last item, which is more mechanical in nature. We do have a headwind associated with higher interest and a little bit in Other. The interest is associated primarily with increased debt related to Infastech that we'll experience throughout the year. Although, we will bring that down as the year closes, but we will -- it will spike throughout the year, which will drive some additional interest expense in 2013. So the last thing to mention is free cash flow. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $1 billion in 2013, which is slightly down from the number I just reviewed for 2012, but let me walk you through that math. In 2012, our free cash flow was $1.60 billion (sic) [$1.06 billion], and within that, approximately, was $150 million of HHI free cash flow. So we backed that out as that won't exist, but then we have free cash flow coming in from Infastech, which will be approximately $90 million. That gets you right on that $1 billion number for 2013. And there is a modest working capital turn improvement in it as well. So let's move to the next page and a little more clarity in some of the seasonality and geographical aspects of our guidance. First of all, seasonality. As all of you know, our first quarter tends to be one of our lower-performance quarters from a volume perspective and it is slightly higher from a tax rate perspective. We expect the first quarter will represent about 17.5% of our full year EPS, which is slightly below our historical number of 18% to 19%, which goes back, in looking at the combined company, for the last 6 years. And it really is driven, as I mentioned, primarily by volume. We tend to see anywhere from $150 million to $250 million less revenue in Q1 versus the average revenue we experienced through Q2, Q3 and Q4. The other factor is that we are making the investments in these corporate growth initiatives that are very important to achieving our 4% to 6% long-term growth objective. They are front-end loaded and so we will experience a little bit of a dilutive impact in Q1 and Q2, in particular, that will cause a little more pressure to this historical percentage that I just provided. And as a result, we think the 17.5% is a reasonable estimate. Shifting over to geographic view. North America, we expect this to continue to see low-single-digit organic growth. We do think that we will continue to see the benefit of early-stage recovery in the U.S. residential construction market. We saw a little bit of that in our CDIY business in 2012, with a 5% organic growth in North America. And we would expect those types of trends to continue as we go into 2013. They will be slightly muted by a slower recovery in our security and industrial markets. However, overall, we do expect low-single-digit growth in North America. Europe, slightly better performance than we experienced in 2012 but not dramatically. We still think we'll see low-single-digit organic revenue declines, primarily in our Industrial and Security businesses, while our CDIY, or our construction markets, will remain relatively flat. And in emerging markets, low-teens organic revenue growth, so somewhat consistent with what we experienced in 2012. But we'll actually start to see that improve more as the year goes on and as those organic growth initiatives that Jim reviewed really start to impact the top line. And then the last thing on the page is just reinforcing what we mentioned related to the organic growth initiatives impact. As you know, there was a negative impact in 2012, with $15 million, as we started the investment process. It's $65 million in 2013, with a negative drag of about $30 million in 2013 or that $0.15 EPS I mentioned. The end result, 3 years now, is we still expect $850 million of revenue associated with this program, incremental, with $200 million of incremental OM, which is approximately a 25% OM rate significantly above our line average. Jim touched on the associated operating expenses and CapEx investments that we'll make over that time frame as well. So on Page 16, a little more clarity around the segments. First of all, CDIY, we do believe we'll see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, so somewhat consistent with what we experienced in 2012. The new products that we continue to introduce really allow us to increase the momentum in North America and grow in emerging markets and outpace any sluggishness that we really experience in Europe, which we expect to be relatively flat performance in Europe. The OM rate will increase slightly year-over-year due to cost synergies, but there will be a bit of a drag on the OM rate temporarily due to some of these investments in growth initiatives that we've touched on. In Security, we do expect a shift from a declining situation to flat to low-single-digit growth in the Security segment in 2013 as modest growth continues to improve in North America. And we'll be able to offset the continued low-digit growth that we would expect to see in Europe in a difficult market over there. The operating margin rate will increase year-over-year due to cost synergies as well as carryover of some of the cost-containment actions that I touched on earlier. And in Industrial, flat to low-single-digit organic revenue growth is expected in our Industrial & Automotive Repair tool business. We would say, relatively flat as we see growth in North America that is offsetting a continued weakness expected in Europe. In Engineered Fastening, we would expect low-single-digit growth as global light-vehicle production continues to slow modestly, and we would expect our business to be modestly impacted as well, but continuing to show growth. And then operating margin rate will actually decrease slightly for Industrial due to 2 things: one, the addition of Infastech, which is slightly below line average, to start, but we would expect that it would get above line average as we get deeper into the integration process; and then some of the investments I mentioned on the growth initiatives as well. So, growth in CDIY will likely outpace Security and Industrial, and then we'll see some nice operating rate expansion in both CDIY and Security. So in summary, to summarize the presentation portion of the call this morning, we do think 2013 will be another solid step towards achieving our mid-decade vision, with 2% to 3% organic growth, beginning to make investments associated with the growth initiatives and 16% to 20% EPS expansion associated with that. Looking back at 2012, it was a transformational year for our company. We divested a business, HHI. That was very successful but we had concerns about the long-term strategic aspects of it. We announced the acquisition of a wonderful company, Infastech, that we believe will be a great addition to our portfolio and ultimately drive a significant amount of organic growth and operating margin rate accretion over the long term. We increased our dividend 20%. And we were able to repurchase $200 million of stock, over and above the HHI repurchases we commenced in late December of 2012. The organic growth initiative programs have commenced in the fourth quarter of 2012. We do believe $850 million of incremental revenue and $200 million of incremental OM will be achieved by 2015 and will allow us to reach that 4% to 6% long-term organic growth goal. Without relying on macro and economic environment, that could be difficult over the next 2 to 3 years. In addition, we have made a tactical pause in significant M&A in 2013, outside of some bolt-ons that we'll do in emerging markets to help us accelerate our organic growth over the long term. But the long-term capital allocation strategy remains the same: Still 2/3 of our free cash flow will be dedicated to acquisitions and 1/3 going back to the shareholders through dividends or opportunistic buybacks, as appropriate. It also allows us to enable a more laser focus on the organic growth and to facilitate our ability to continue to improve our CFROI and allow it to move into the middle of that target range we look for, 12% to 15%, in 2013. The Stanley Fulfillment System really allows us to drive a lot of the things that we're doing. We saw the benefits again in working capital in 2012. Jim touched on how we think it will begin to allow us to drive more organic growth in the company. And we feel good that 2013 will be another solid step towards our mid-decade vision.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Lorraine, we're ready for the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Credit -- from Credit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: You talked a lot about the -- sort of the organic growth, but I was wondering about the CDIY. You talked about the operating margin to increase slightly, with the cost synergies. You're doing a great job in terms of looking at sort of pricing incentives there to help margins slightly. Is there further opportunity that you have there in '13 and beyond as we think about margins in that?
Donald Allan: Yes, I -- this is Don. I think the -- 2013 for CDIY will continue to be a nice year of mid-single-digit organic growth, us focused on more margin accretion related to the cost synergies. But it's also important to recognize that we do want to make sure that these growth investments are in place and begin to get a impact in the back half of 2013. So that will mute clearly the operating margin rate expansion, to some extent. But going forward, as far as looking at this business and operating margin rate, we do see -- still see opportunity for further expansion. And I think one of the bigger areas will be our ability to focus on these organic growth programs in emerging markets. If you look at the incremental operating margin rate, it's 25 associated with these growth initiatives. A large part of that is impacting CDIY. And so even if we do see price pressure in certain areas, overall, I do believe that we'll be able to continue to expand operating margin rate.
Operator: And our next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: You spent a lot of time talking about the emerging markets opportunity and your approach to it, but I did have one additional question. You -- we talked about opening up a few different plants. I gather these are probably going to be relatively small, mostly assembly oriented, but I wanted to confirm that. And when you talk about opening up an Indian plant and expanding Brazil and maybe China and Turkey as well, I was wondering if you could be a little more specific about which countries you were thinking about prioritizing, particularly as it relates to opening up plants, this year.
James M. Loree: Sure, Steve. First of all, you're right about the plants being relatively small. There's no need to build monuments at this point in time. And the key for these plants is to keep the overhead down because the competitors don't have high overhead and some of our plants in the emerging markets that serve the Western markets have a lot more overhead than the local plants of competitors serving the local markets. So there is a very important element of that, which is keeping the overhead down. It's really a different approach. We have to have the -- kind of the Western-company mentality in terms of compliance with regulations and all those sorts of things, and environmental and so on, but we cannot have the Western mentality as it relates to the overhead in the plants. So relatively small, and typical investment for something -- for a plant of this nature would be in the neighborhood of around $10 million. And then the other question that's in terms of prioritization: Interestingly, when we look at the emerging markets and -- 70%, we think, of the growth in the tool and hardware industry over the next 20 years is going to come from the emerging markets, in our view. And when we look at where the growth is going to come from, we can start with the BRICs. That'll be about 1/3. And then there's the Next 11, headlined by Turkey and Indonesia. That'll be another 1/3, the Next 11. And then all the other countries after that will be the last 1/3. So a strategy to go in and just serve the BRICs or China and India or even -- or something like that really won't get the kind of fast-mover advantage that we think we can have here and it certainly won't capitalize on the opportunities. So unlike many initiatives where you say, "Okay, let's just focus on the 80% rule," here you have to have a layered strategy. And we've got terrific infrastructure already in Latin America. So when you look at the BRICs, for us it's really Russia, India and China. In China, clearly, we will have a plant serving the local market plant or plants. We have one in India already. We may have another one at some point in time. And then Russia, Russia, you don't need a plant. Russia can basically import from China very cost effectively. There's no competitor that has a plant in Russia that -- of any material size. So that kind of covers the BRICs. Then you start getting into Indonesia and Turkey. Presumably, at some point, we'll have a plant in Turkey. Not -- it's not a top priority, but it's something that we're obviously looking at and working on. And maybe in Indonesia. The rest of the Next 11 can be served from the plant infrastructure that I just talked about. And then certainly the last 1/3, the strategy to go into those countries will be quite different than it will be for the BRICs and the Next 11. It will be a far less-intensive approach and more -- it'll be much more of a kind of an import model into those countries until they develop over time. So for instance, Africa is going to be incredibly important in the future, but it probably will be 10 years before we can justify a major thrust into Africa with plants and the whole nine yards of infrastructure.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I had a question about your outlook for Security in 2013, specifically in North America. I believe you're looking for modest growth to be offset mostly or completely by Europe. I was wondering if you could go into the growth drivers in North America for Security. And I think over time Security in general has been looked at as a higher-growth opportunity as you've pieced it together over the last 10 years through different acquisitions. And I -- maybe first talk about 2013 drivers, what's working for you, what's maybe still an opportunity and, additionally, how the growth in Security in North America has played out over the last few years relative to your expectations.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, I'll take that, Mike. There's some level of granularity we're not going to provide on this call. But I think we've been fairly public. Remember, our -- you know well, our Security business in general, and North American business in particular, is overwhelmingly commercial. About 20% to 25% of that business is driven by non-residential or commercial construction. That's the biggest driver. About another 15% is retail construction. And as Jim pointed out, while commercial construction is improving from a very low base, we still don't anticipate for that to be a robust market. So what's slowed down the growth of that business the last 2 or 3 years is, quite frankly, the complete lack of any commercial construction activity or, certainly, the reduction in commercial construction activity. And we do need new commercial construction to get the new accounts, to prime the pump to generate the recurring revenue that is so important to that business. The opportunities, though, are in areas such as -- where we're less developed such as health care, which, as you know, is an important small but emerging high-growth business for us that we report within our Security business. And with the acquisition of Niscayah, particularly in North America, the Niscayah team is -- was very well positioned. It has tremendous vertical market expertise in the financial and banking sectors. That's 2 areas where, up until now, we had very, very little business. And we think that we have the opportunity to grow in those areas irrespective of market conditions. So you got a commercial construction market that is anything but robust, but we think it'll be a little better than -- it'll be no worse than prior years, with the upside opportunities in health care, financial institutions, all other things, a very little change from prior years.
James M. Loree: Yes, and I'll take a stab at kind of adding something to that, which is we've done as a company, I think, 70 acquisitions over a 10-year period. And of those, the vast majority have been in Security. And they have been all-consuming into -- for the management team. When we bought into what we thought was a high-growth market and in normal -- under normal circumstances historically, it has been both from a secular point of view, given the importance of Security growing and so forth, and also just from the standpoint of being a technologically driven market that has a lot of innovation and value-creating change going on within the industry. So it is a high-growth market. It has been depressed by commercial construction over the years. But the key to growing in -- and outperforming vis-à-vis the market regardless of what size the market is at any point in time, or growth rate it has, is to have differentiated value propositions. And what I would say we did over the course of building the Security business was we assembled all the pieces that are required to provide differentiated value propositions to various industry verticals, so for instance, health care, education, financial services, government, the global customer that wants to be served in a global fashion like an industrial or that type of organization. So we have all these pieces. And one of the thoughts behind the hiatus that we went on in July was that we're not getting above-market growth in Security. And in order to do so, we have to spend the time and focus the same people that have are -- have been focused on doing over approximately 50 acquisitions and focus them on organic growth and taking with we have and maximizing it. And I just got back from a sales meeting from North America Security, where they had every commercial person in the organization gathered in one location, and they have gotten to the point now where they've been able to take these value propositions that I've discussed here and now commercializing them -- in the process of commercializing them. I've never seen, in the Security business, a more charged-up sales force than we have right now because they finally have what they need to grow and they're going to go out and do it. So I would suggest that we are totally on the right track in terms of growth in the Security business. We have -- if you look back, you can certainly argue that it hasn't been what we'd hoped for, but I'm very confident that it will be, on a prospective basis.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities.
Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Had a question on the Security, longer term, on the margin. So you're around 15%, 16% right now. What's the progression to get to that -- back to that high-teens rate? I think, John, you referenced you're going to need some macro strength on the commercial construction market, retail construction market. But other than that, is there anything that would prevent you from getting there over a 2- to 3-year period?
John F. Lundgren: The answer is -- Don's going to give you a little more granularity, Rich. But remember, Niscayah is a big piece of that now. It's way below line average margin. That being said, we've increased the Niscayah operating margin between 500 and 800 basis points. So part of it is simply math, as the Niscayah represents almost 40% of our Security segment now and the margins continue to increase. But I'll ask Don to give you just a little more granularity than that.
Donald Allan: Yes, Rich, if you look at -- obviously, Jim reviewed the Q4 performance where you had that segment, it was 15.5%, but without Niscayah, it was closer to 17.3%. So clearly, the underlying business is still kind of in that 17% to 19% range that we're striving for in this business. And in the third quarter, it was closer to the 19% number when you excluded Niscayah. So it really comes down to our continued execution on the cost synergies in Niscayah and a combination of making sure that some of these growth initiatives -- although Jim didn't go through as much detail and the ones in Security, but there are certainly some significant growth initiatives in the world of Security as well, in that $850 million, that will allow us to stimulate more volume growth, which ultimately will help us leverage the cost base and ultimately drive those percentages in that range of 17% to 19%, with an average of probably about 18%. I mean, I really believe that this business, based on its current makeup, is in that category and it's more of a timing issue over the next few years.
John F. Lundgren: Rich, and I'll remind you of one more thing. I know you're aware of this, but remind you, and I think it's important for everyone else on the call, this business overall, more on the mechanical than the convergent side, does have a little bit of seasonality. And historically, if you go back in time, you're looking at a couple hundred basis points lower margins in the first and fourth calendar quarters, a lot of reasons. We've discussed them, and more -- better margins in the second and third quarter. It's purely due to seasonality. And so as you're looking at that long-term margins, take a 12-month look and project forward. And be careful projecting off a quarter because I would argue that second and third quarter flatters our margins a little bit, and first and fourth quarter depresses them somewhat artificially due to seasonality.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.
Joshua Wilson: This is Josh filling in for Sam. A quick clarification before my main question. You said Niscayah was 40% of Security segment sales in 2012?
John F. Lundgren: It's -- well, remember you take out HHI and add Niscayah, it's almost 50% of what's now remaining.
Joshua Wilson: 50% of the remaining. And then shifting gears to the Infastech acquisition. Could you give us some color, if possible, on what's going on to delay the timing in there and why there might be risk to the close before February?
John F. Lundgren: There's -- simply said, it's factors really beyond our control. China has a very methodical antitrust, believe it or not, approval process. We've done everything we can do. We are in the queue and, simply said, any acquisition is very, very thoroughly reviewed and that we see little or no risk. As I'm sure you're aware, Chinese New Year, which starts in mid-February, things do slow down a lot, so I believe there is an incentive on the authority side to get that behind them prior to Chinese New Year. And obviously, there's an incentive for us to get it done. But what our advisers tell us is we've done everything we can do. It's in good hands. It's going through a very normal and expected, albeit a slow, approval process. But we don't see any -- there's -- there are no numerical activities or issues, it's just a question of time.
James M. Loree: Yes, exactly. There's no reason...
John F. Lundgren: So 100 -- 99.9% probability of closing. The question is purely on timing, if that helps.
Operator: And our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Two questions, kind of related to the longer-term targets that are intertwined. The first is, on the ROCE target of 15%, can you just tell us what that is today or what that was in '12 and how you guys calculate that? And then relative to the 4% to 6% organic growth target for the whole company, how would North America look in -- within that target range?
Donald Allan: Yes, I would say the ROCE at the end of 2012 was about 10.5%. And Kate can send you the details of the calculation because it's not exactly clear cut. But it's relatively consistent with what you would expect with an ROI calculation, with some adjustments for after-tax interest and amortization, in some cases. So when we look at that and we say, "How are we going to get that to 15%?" We clearly think that we'll get a significant improvement in 2013 just from the fact that we won't be doing any significant acquisitions. And we'll continue to show significant earnings improvement, with almost 20% EPS growth in that time frame. And so we would expect probably almost a 2-point improvement in 2013 from that level. The associated CFROI, or cash flow return on investment, at the end of 2012 was about 12%. And so there's about a 2-point -- 1.5- to 2-point gap between ROCE and CFROI and that's probably due to the intangible amortization that we experienced through a lot of these noncash expenses through the acquisitions that we've done over the last 8 years. And we would expect a similar result in there, where that would improve probably 1.5 to 2 points as well in 2013. And so we feel like we're on track to really move that forward, and both those ratios, getting them in that 12% to 15% band, even ROCE, probably in 2013. In North America, it's likely going to be a little bit higher than the line average for the whole company, but we don't have -- we don't exactly do a precise calculation...
James M. Loree: North America was not on revenue. It was on organic growth, not on ROCE, up to 4% to 6% organic growth.
Donald Allan: Yes, I mean, the 4% to 6% organic growth in North America, I would say that that's probably -- when you look at that over the long term, I would say that you're probably still looking at a couple of points of growth, frankly, in North America. And so the bulk of the growth is going to come, I would imagine, in emerging markets over the long term.
James M. Loree: Yes, if we can get the core growth rate in North America to 2% to 3%, the 4% to 6% is very achievable. And just -- because it is 50% of our volume, yes. And just one other thought on the ROCE and the cash flow return on investment. The ROCE for us over the years has become disconnected from the cash flow return on investment because of our acquisitive activity and the amortization that's associated with it. It's really -- I mean, for those of -- that are familiar and have studied it, it's really more of a book income concept than it is a cash income concept. And we're evaluating -- as a management team right now, we're evaluating moving to more of a cash flow return investment view because it actually is more relevant to our business today because our cash earnings are substantially higher than our book earnings. And we are going to discuss that at the -- at our next analyst meeting, which will occur sometime in the middle of the year, date to be announced. So we'll have more on that, but I think cash flow return on investment is increasingly more relevant to measuring the return on investment of this company.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Quick question. The 17% -- or just to begin to address this, the 17% EPS in 1Q compares to 22% EBIT mix last year, so if there's any outlying driver, if you could address that briefly. But with Niscayah, because it's such a large piece of the business, could you update us where we are in the transition? If I think about HSM, the reverse integration that you did, you were sloughing off low-margin install business as you transition to a more a recurring revenue mix. Can you highlight the challenges and successes you've faced in that relative to the economic stress that we've had?
James M. Loree: Yes, I will address the Niscayah while Don racks his brain and tries to figure out the answer to your other question.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: It's seems -- the EBIT mix is lower.
James M. Loree: Well, we've owned Niscayah something like 16 months now. And when we bought it, it was one of those -- it was a contested situation. So we didn't have the normal opportunity to go in and vet the management team thoroughly, like we would with a uncontested transaction. And so the hope was that we were going to get some good people at the headquarters and that we were going to be able to take our basic business processes that we have in North America and implement them in Europe in fairly short order. And what we found was that we had strong country managers in -- for the most part, in Niscayah, which was good, but we also found that the centralized management team was quite weak in Europe. We...
John F. Lundgren: [indiscernible] country managers in the U.S. as well.
James M. Loree: Yes, yes, yes. So in any event, yes, I -- well, everything I've said thus far relates to Europe. And we'll talk about North America separately. So we put a Stanley leader in charge of the business. He replaced the entire management team within about 4 months after ownership, and they have gotten great traction. And they have outperformed their cost synergies. And now they're really focused on growing the business in a tough environment. One of the challenges with Niscayah was that, from a growth perspective, in addition to the environment, was the fact that a fairly significant percentage of their revenue came from referrals from Securitas because they were -- at one time, Securitas and Niscayah were part of the same company and then they were spun, Niscayah was spun from the parent. And they still had a symbiotic relationship because Niscayah was the electronic business and Securitas was the guarding business. And so when a customer needed electronics, they were referred over to Niscayah. So we've had to kind of fill that -- the gap there in the revenue that no longer comes from Securitas because they were the ones that we contested the acquisition with so they're not the -- they're not our friendliest allies out there in the marketplace. So I think the management team has done a fabulous job, when you think about the revenue being down about 5% on the average this last year organically, of filling the gap for the lost business from Securitas as well as dealing with a difficult market in Europe. And they're -- it's very stable. They're going to perform at or above the cost synergy targets. And the acquisition is going to drive every bit of return that we thought it would. And in addition to that, it has really enabled us to be a global security franchise. We're really one -- we're really the only commercial security company in the world that can coordinate globally now, which is a big advantage. So all that is a good story. It's a tough environment. We bought it right before the European market issues were manifested. However, we expected that, we anticipated that. And so I think in the end this is going to be a terrific acquisition. It's -- the operating margins are about double what they were when we bought it, now, and moving on up again this year as well. So it's all in pretty good place. The North American piece, I think, was, for the most part, a pleasant surprise in the sense that -- I talked earlier about these value propositions and the verticals and so forth. They brought in North America great strength in these verticals. So they had a vertical market approach in North America. They were relatively subscale but they managed to do quite well with their business despite that because they have such strong vertical value propositions. We've taken those and we've now integrated them with the commercial force in North America, which has given us an advantage, we think, in the marketplace, especially as we pursue these organic growth initiatives. So I think on balance, we're very happy with Niscayah. It would have been better if the public relations aspect of this, buying a European company, hadn't occurred 2 months before the Europe went into a deep freeze, but nonetheless, we anticipated that. We have it all built into our pro formas, and it's going to be a great acquisition. It already is.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, just one final point, Ken, on Niscayah, and Jim touched on it -- 2 points, I think, just to close the loop because the last thing we'd want to leave is any impression that the integration thus far has been anything but a terrific success, that we're completely satisfied, more than satisfied with the acquisitions and what it does for us. But the first point Jim made and an important one: We normally hit the ground with our feet running 90 days before closing. And simply said, the integration process started on closing because it was a contested public acquisition of a public company. We're on schedule. We just started 3 to 6 months later than we normally are allowed to start. Second, Jim referenced North America and subscale great franchises. Only 15% of the business is in North America, but upwards of 30% of the synergies came from North America because we were able to consolidate, as Jim suggested, and address that subscale issue. Don, you've got a -- you got a view on the calendarization of EBIT?
Donald Allan: Yes. So the answer to the question, Ken, is, as I mentioned, 17.5% of our total EPS will happen in Q1, which is slightly below when you look at the historical trends. There's a couple of factors. When you look at Q1 last year, our operating margin for Q1 represented about 22% of the total year operating margin, which is close to the EBIT number or EBITDA number you were mentioning. In this year, we would expect that operating margin number to actually be closer to 20% of the total for the year, in Q1. Why is there a difference? Well, the real -- the main difference, frankly, is these investments we're making in growth. As I touched on, we do have a dilutive impact for the year. The bigger part of that dilutive impact happens in Q1, and it begins to moderate as we get into Q2 and starts to flatten out in Q3. So that's the driver associated with that. And then the other area would be in the area of interest and tax. So we will -- our interest will spike, as I mentioned, due to the Infastech transaction temporarily throughout the year. We will see that happen initially in Q1 and then begin to work its way down as the year goes on. And then in addition to that, the tax rate, we did have a modest tax benefit in Q1 of last year that's also affecting that, that we don't expect to repeat.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Research: Could you elaborate on the roadmap or experience you've had in the past with the mid-price-point product that gives you visibility that you can gain share and achieve a 35% gross profit margin without bringing in more price competition from the people that you're taking the share from?
John F. Lundgren: Yes, I think it's as simple as -- and I think, Jim described it pretty well. We are familiar enough with the end markets that we understand the features that people will pay for and they won't. And our history with a product that was successful at lower margins was, quite frankly, we were up. I'll use the not-so-elegant term of dummying down products produced for the West by taking cost out to get to a price point where it would sell. The new approach, and it's a pervasive effort across our company, of designing to value, what will -- what product teardowns? What will an end user pay for? What does he value, and what does he not value? So simply, it's reengineering these products from a clean sheet of paper, as opposed to trying to just take cost out of a higher-cost product produced with more features and benefits for a market that it wasn't designed for. And as Jim said, to do that, we need basically a 0-base or clean-sheet engineering approach, which we've invested in and that's part of the investment that Jim alluded to. And secondly, we need to produce it locally in plants. They're going to be -- they're certainly going to be capable -- not capable, they will adhere to Western EH&S standards. Some of them are already our plants but with a lot less overhead, a lot less infrastructure than some of the plants designed to produce premium-priced products in low-cost countries but to export to Western markets. So the combination of designed for local market needs and produced in local markets will give us a tremendous edge, and this is something we've got a lot of experience with. We know what the price points are in the market. So we're beyond cautiously optimistic. We're confident that this approach is going to yield the kind of results we're looking for.
James M. Loree: And in addition to all that, we have looked at a number of companies that do this and in terms of business development activity. And I can tell you that their income statements and their cash flow statements and so forth, when you consider what -- the things that we know and the synergies that we can bring to that sort of business model, we -- there is an existence theorem. And I think it's really important because what John described was now 80% to 90% the theory of the case, but we have examples in the emerging markets of business development targets that we've looked at that can get there and so we know it can be done.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jason Feldman from UBS.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Thank you for the detail on the strategic growth initiatives. It was very helpful. But when we think about those organic growth initiatives as you kind of stretch to get to the 4% to 6% long-term organic growth range, do we need to start thinking about incremental margins differently as kind of an ongoing structural basis? Or do you view these kind of upfront initial investments as more kind of onetime-ish in nature and then ultimately will kind of get back to the incremental margins that you've targeted historically?
James M. Loree: Yes, the organic growth has the ability to drive operating leverage in the company. So while there will be some investments, the investments, for the most part, are simply the operating expense that kind of goes with the gross margin in order to get a certain contribution margin. In some cases, if we're building a plant and so forth, there will be some additional fixed costs. But I would say that we fully expect the emerging market element of this to be, overall, rate accretive to the company, even with all of those investments, very quickly. So it'll be a net positive for operating margins over the long term for the company from the emerging markets. And then most of the other thing that we're doing are very much relying on existing plant, existing facilities. We're adding salespeople, for the most part, commercialization people. That is going to be more incremental at the contribution margin line, based on what we do today. And in most of these initiatives, we're -- as you walk through them, in many cases you'll see that every one of them has a specific value proposition associated with it. And we're big believers in that, the stronger the value proposition, the more you can get paid for something. And we're very much interested in value-pricing these as we go forward.
Operator: And our next question comes from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: The -- you -- I think hand tools, you commented, were flat in the quarter, which related to you walking away from some of the lower-margin business. I'm curious, as you look at '12 and '13, how you look at the market share performance of hand tools and what you see going on inside of that business.
Donald Allan: Yes, I would say that, John articulated us walking away from business, which I -- this was a very intelligent decision by our CDIY team. As you know, we look at different pieces of our business and make sure that we're achieving certain levels of profitability and pricing associated with that, but ultimately, we also are very aggressive around new product innovation and technologies that help us drive growth as much as possible. And when I look at the hand tools business: It will be a business that will continue to grow. When I think about CDIY in 2013 growing mid single digits, I don't see why hand tools wouldn't be very close to that type of growth in 2013.
James M. Loree: Which would imply modest share gain.
Donald Allan: Which would imply modest share gain. And it also would imply that we continue to drive activities in emerging markets that will help that global growth number as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Peter Lisnic from Robert Baird.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: The -- can you give us a little feel for the implications for the change away from the direct model in U.S. Mechanical Access? Just kind of discuss the strategic implications there and what that might mean for what I thought used to be, at least, or might still be one of the highest-return profiles business-wise in your portfolio.
John F. Lundgren: Sure, Pete. That's a -- it's a great question. And I think Jim gave a great start to answering it in his prepared remarks, so I'm going to kick it to him. But importantly, it is a conversation that we've spent a lot of time internally having as a corporate management team and with Brett's team. But Jim, why don't you just elaborate a little bit on this year?
James M. Loree: Yes. I think now is a great time to do it, number one. It historically has served Best quite well because, if you go back when I -- if you go back to the -- I think it was the '30s when Best kind of came into existence, they had a patented product that was the interchangeable core that played extremely well in certain segments of the market like health care, education, government and so on. And they -- and as the market evolved over the years, they had the direct model and the 2 largest competitors had a distribution-oriented model. And as the economy slowed down and construction slowed down over the last 5 years or so, the distributors, with their profit margins under pressure, began to look more and more at other ways to grow their business and to grow their profits and they started becoming more aggressive in some of the markets that were traditional home territory of Best. And today, we're not dealing with a proprietary interchangeable core anymore. The patents have all expired and so forth. So our sales force is largely accustomed to being sort of -- had a farming mentality, if you will, in serving these customers and did a lot of transactional support for the customers and so forth, things that distributors do very well. But they weren't out there with the size and scope of go-to-market resources that the distributors were. And though -- and we did have the advantage that we could cover multi-geographic locations more effectively with a direct model, but it also is more expensive. And so when we've looked at this change, we think that this is a moment in time when we have enough value to add to the distributors in the sense that we have an installed base, very valuable, and we have extremely robust new product development for the first time during our ownership of Best Access, especially in the mid-price-point product, which has become extremely important in the -- with the economic issues that are going on today. So for us, to get to the construction market, we felt we needed to make this change. And we felt that it's always somewhat risky in an entrenched distribution model, but we believe that this is a time -- a moment in time when we have enough value to add to these distributors that we can partner up with them and put away the competitive aspect that we've had that's always made it difficult to work, to coexist, with the distributors with the kind of a hybrid model that we had. And we've taken a lot of cost out of the field in order to account for the somewhat-lower gross margins that'll be associated with this. And so we think it's income neutral from the standpoint of making the change because of the cost takeouts. And we think that this will enable us to really charge up the organic growth in the MAS model. So we still believe that it will be a great return business on a go-forward basis, but we think it'll be a higher-growth business.
Operator: And our last question comes from Liam Burke from Janney Capital Markets.
Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: You've had a great deal of success on the working capital management side. It's been a focus, and obviously, the cash flow is reflected in that. With a lot of effort in the growth of emerging markets, how does that affect your working capital management forecast?
Donald Allan: Yes, I would say that I wouldn't see them having a significant impact on working capital. We still feel very passionate that achieving 10 working capital turns by the middle of this decade is achievable. And all the initiatives that we're looking at in emerging markets, we don't expect to impact that objective. Now that being said, we probably will end up carrying a little more inventory in that part of the world to make sure that we meet the needs of customers, but when you assess the impact as a percentage of the whole company, it's not going to be more than a tenth or two of an impact across the whole company. And it doesn't really impact our objective of getting to 10 working capital turns.
Operator: Thank you. Do you have any final remarks at this time?
Kathryn H. White Vanek: No. I just want to thank everybody for logging in today and participating. Please let me know if you need anything in the way of follow-ups.
Operator: Thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q3 2012 Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sandra, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kate Vanek. Ms. Vanek, you may begin.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Thank you, Sandra. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today for Stanley Black & Decker's Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, President and CEO; Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to on the call, are available on the IR portion of our website, as well as via the webcast, and also on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of the call will begin today at 2:00 p.m. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's 2012 third quarter results and various other topical matters, followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] And as always, please feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions after the call. And as I normally have to do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody. And for those of you have been able to read the press release this morning, hopefully, you've taken away from it that our focus does remain on driving long-term growth and achieving our mid-decade vision of being a $15 billion-revenue company with 15% operating margins, irrespective of the macroeconomic backdrop. What we're going to try to cover this morning is what we're doing to counter some of the headwinds in the marketplace in an effort to essentially determine our own destiny, drive organic growth in the face of relatively flat developed markets through, among other things, an increased focus in emerging markets and some, I think, very, very exciting programs in well-developed markets. Revenues in the third quarter did increase 6% year-on-year to $2.8 billion. Organic revenues were flat. CDIY grew 4% organically with an operating margin rate, excluding charges, of 15.8%. That is the highest operating margin rate we've been able to achieve since the merger of Stanley Black & Decker almost 3 years ago. Industrial and Security were both pressured by certain weak end markets and particularly, Europe. And to counter some of those, you're going to hear a lot from Jim a little later on in his presentation about some of the investments and organic growth initiatives that have already begun and will carry on throughout the next 12 to 24 months. Our third quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.40. Again, that's excluding charge of $0.69 GAAP EPS, including all the charges we do in the appendix of this presentation have a detailed definition and explanation of what's in the charges. The Niscayah integration continues to go well, operating margins to exceed 12% this year when it's finished. That's up 500 basis points from fiscal year '11, shortly less than -- exactly 1 year after closing that deal. Importantly, we've reached definitive agreement to divest our Hardware & Home Improvement business, which marked another key step in the continued transformation of our portfolio. We've discussed this a lot over the last 2 to 3 years. This is a good business with a capable management team, and it's been under review from day 1 of the merger. And our conclusion was that while it may not be the best business long-term given our strategic objectives and geographical portfolio, we needed to fix it first. It's a much more profitable business than it was 3 years ago. And we believe we've accomplished the major strategic milestone in placing that business in the hands of new owners. It brings our U.S. home center exposure, not down to too low a level, but back to the pre-merger Black & Decker levels in the low teens. It does retain, nonetheless, the upside to the U.S. housing rebound, and that our CDIY business, which is still over $5 billion, is $1.5 billion below the revenue, a pro forma revenue, from peak. That's simply the pro forma Stanley Black & Decker revenue 2009, '10, prior to the more recent decline. And as a consequence, HHI never factored into that calculation. And finally, Don will give you some more detail on this in his forward look, but when considering Infastech, some of the smaller acquisitions we've completed in 2012, this divestiture -- and this divestiture, the revenue splits geographically around the country will be -- around the world will be approximately 46% U.S., 27% Europe, 16% emerging markets. And again, to reemphasize, Jim is going to talk to you about some of the programs designed to drive that 16% to and beyond our 20% objective by mid-decade. Moving on to our -- the global footprint versus prior year. Organic sales, as I said, were flat as strength in U.S. and emerging markets was offset by weakness in Europe and some of the smaller developed markets. You'll hear a lot about this in the segments. But quickly looking at the U.S., which still accounts for 53% of our business in the third quarter, we grew 1%. Europe, overall, was down 3% organically but with a lot of moving pieces. Excluding CDIY, Europe was down about 8%. That's primarily IAR and Security. Jim will talk about this in the segment detail. Including Niscayah, Niscayah is down but actually slightly less than our model at the acquisition time. And operating margin, as previously mentioned, for Niscayah is up almost 500 basis points. Importantly, our high-growth emerging markets, Asia, up 15%; Latin America, up 12%, continue to be strong points, growing well, albeit at a slightly slower pace; and last but not least, some of the smaller developed markets, such as Canada, Australia and Japan, down low to mid-single digits. Looking at our sources of growth. Engineered Fastening and CDIY were clearly the bright spots in the quarter in terms of organic growth, and as suggested, offset by softness in Security markets, IAR and Infrastructure. Globally, adding all 3 segments together, volume was flat. Price was flat, which arithmetically is 0% in terms of organic growth. We added 9% via acquisitions, plus 3% due to currency, and as a consequence, that gets you to the 6% revenue growth for the company in the quarter. Looking at some of the pieces. Engineered Fastening, up 7% despite being down 3% in Europe, that's obviously a significant share gain for this strategic business, which is what gave us the confidence to add Infastech to this platform to continue to advance that business on a global level. That organic growth rate is obviously well above the rate of light vehicle production, and that's due to increased vehicle penetration across the board. Great work by that team because about 60-plus percent of that business still focuses on the automotive end markets. And one of the strategic -- the primary strategic rationale behind Infastech was to further diversify the verticals that our Engineered Fastening business serves. Strength across the board in our Tools business. In our CDIY business, Professional Power Tools, up 5%; Hand Tools and Fastening, up 5%; Consumer Products Group, primarily the Black & Decker brand, up 4%, just very, very solid performance in the third quarter, which gave us tremendous satisfaction and, obviously, strong indication that our -- the new product engine continues to work, and share gains continue to be achieved. Our mechanical residential security business was up 3%. The commercial security locking business was down 3%. And Convergent Security, excluding Niscayah, was down 4%. Jim will talk to you a little bit about MAS Commercial, and we're addressing an MPP product gap that we think we've resolved. And in CSS, it's more about conversion of existing backlog that has been and will continue to be our focus. And finally, IAR and Infrastructure. IAR in Europe was down 7%, tough market conditions. We continue to have a very valuable business there. IAR North America, Mac continues to perform well, tremendous improvement in that business. And the Infrastructure subsegment of our Industrial platform was impacted by very little offshore activity in our CRC-Evans business -- onshore activity, pardon me. Offshore is doing well. It's growing rapidly, but it's a very small part of the business. And there's virtually nothing happening currently in the onshore market. And of course, in our Hydraulics business, the scrap steel prices are tremendously depressed, and that has a significant and direct impact on our Hydraulics business. So that's the view from 36,000 feet. I'm now going to ask Jim Loree to take you through some of the segment detail, looking backwards, but of equal or greater importance. Jim is going to introduce the highlights of some of our organic growth programs, new organic growth programs, that are coming into play right now.
James M. Loree: Okay. Thanks, John. I'll move through the segments fairly quickly today as the story is relatively clear, and I'd like to spend more time outlining the details of our new organic growth initiatives, which will enable us to achieve our long-term objectives with no help from the environment. Starting with CDIY. CDIY had a respectable organic growth quarter with impressive margin rate expansion. Revenues totaled $1.38 billion, up 3%. The OM rate was record 15.8%, up 260 basis points versus a year ago. Organic growth was up 4%, with unit volume up by the same percentage. The majority of OM rate accretion was driven by merger synergies, volume leverage and variable cost productivity. Along geographic axis, mid-teens organic growth in Latin America once again more than offset EMEA, which was flat, latter a laudable achievement given weak margin conditions, especially in Southern Europe. The U.S. was up 5% organically. Sales by product line were solid as Professional Power Tools were up 5%, Consumer up 4% and Tools Fastening up 5%. Each subsegment had its own success drivers to overcome what was on balance a tepid market environment. Professional Tools continued to exploit its ongoing cordless launch success. Consumer enjoyed growing momentum from its highly innovative Gyro and Matrix product introductions. And Tools and Fastening benefited from Latin America revenue synergies and the DeWalt Hand Tool launch. Looking forward, we expect continued solid organic growth performance in the segment despite ongoing external market issues. And we also expect the fourth quarter margin rate to hold in the same zip code as in the third quarter. Now moving to Security. Security margin rates continued strong sequential progression as Niscayah synergies are realized. Security revenues totaled $790 million, up 22%. The OM rate was 16.5% and 18.8% excluding Niscayah. The operating margin rate, including Niscayah, is up nicely for the third consecutive quarter. As a refresher, 1Q was 13.4%, 2Q was 15.3% and 3Q, again, was 16.5%. Organic sales were down 3%, with Convergent down 4%, Mechanical up 2 points, and Healthcare, a small percentage of the segment, under some pressure. CSS Europe was down 6% organically or 5% on a pro forma basis, which more than offset legacy CSS North America, which grew 2% organically. A solid performance in Resi hardware, up 3%, was partially offset by Access Technologies and commercial hardware, which were down 6% and 1%, respectively. Access continues to experience declines at its largest customer, associated with reduced remodels and store openings, which was responsible for all of its decrease. Commercial hardware markets are weak in the retrofit segment, including healthcare, education and municipalities, Stanley's traditional strengths. New construction markets are modestly stronger but rely upon -- more upon MPP or mid-priced-point products, which are currently a gap for us, as John mentioned. The Tong Lung acquisition, which is near completion, will quickly address this gap. And just to clarify, part of the Tong Lung acquisition will be going with the HHI disposition and an important part, including a Taiwanese plant and an important engineering center in Taiwan, will stay with us in the Commercial hardware business. Healthcare continues to bear the brunt of lower hospital CapEx spending levels, as well as its customers' propensity to defer ordering until its next-generation patient security products are released in 2013. And when the AeroScout acquisition anniversaries in mid-2013 and the legacy product updates are complete, this business should become a robust organic growth driver. Moving to Niscayah. The integration continues to progress well, and it appears the cost synergy realization will be in line or better than expected and should be sufficient to protect EPS accretion in light of the difficult European markets. In this regard, the Niscayah OM rate will exceed 12% for the full year 2012, and we expect its run rate to approach segment line average rates by the end of 2013, with the mid-teens performance for full year 2013. And now on to Industrial. In the face of difficult global markets, Industrial maintained a solid OM rate performance. Revenues were $621 million, down 2%, both organically and in total. The OM rate was 15.4%, down 150 basis points versus a year ago and up 30 basis points sequentially. For Industrial & Auto Repair, Europe and the U.S. were down organically 7% and 4%, respectively. Emerging markets were a bright spot, with a mid-teens organic growth rate, and Mac also delivered a solid growth performance. Once again, Engineered Fastening demonstrated why it is a growth platform, with an impressive 7% organic growth performance. Emhart Europe was contained to a 3% organic decline, and the Americas and Asia both kicked in for double-digit organic performances to enable a strong overall 7% result. This was achieved with only a 3% increase in global auto production, as well as very weak industrial markets, especially in Europe. So across the company in summary, weak markets, with Europe by far the weakest, and the slowing but still strong demand in the emerging markets and policy uncertainty in the U.S., this was anything but an easy quarter. CDIY, benefiting from favorable U.S. conditions and strong product introductions, clearly outperformed. Both Security and Industrial maintained respectable margins in the face of market-related growth issues. However, one thing became crystal clear as we move through this quarter, now 5 years into a sluggish macro environment, and that is that we must take our growth destiny into our own hands. And during the July conference call, I introduced the major organic growth initiatives that we are pursuing, which we'll do just that. Today, I will expand on that further to give you a lens into what we are doing to drive growth with no help from the environment. So on the organic growth slide. In 2Q, we identified close to $1 billion in organic growth programs over a 3-year period, which we shared with you during the July call. Since then, we have refined our approach by staffing the programs with leaders and building the programs out with detailed project plans and resource requirements. And on this page, you can see the 6 programs provide $800 million to $900 million of annualized growth, building over a 3-year period. We expect the growth phasing as follows: 2013, $150 million; in 2014 and 2015, $350 million each year. And operating expense investment of about $100 million will be made to drive the growth, which will be at about a $65 million level for 2013 and also will commence in the fourth quarter. The $100 million includes $20 million of brand development expense for the emerging markets. There will also be about $50 million of CapEx required to support the programs, which will be included within the company's normal CapEx run rate levels. So let's take them one at a time. First, emerging markets, a $400 million opportunity, in addition to the robust growth that we are already enjoying in these regions. And I'll come back to emerging markets in a page or 2 and expand upon this because we have a fair amount of information on that, but let's cover the other ones. Advanced industrial solutions. The objective here is to create a market, the smart tools and storage market, using RFID and RTLS technology. There are several elements to this. We have electronic kanbans, we have an MRP vending business and several other elements to it that all basically have one thing in common, that is that they utilize technology to drive productivity on the factory floor. What we're going to be doing in this business, since we've already assembled the pieces with CribMaster and with AeroScout, what we are missing at this point is a really sizable field force. And we've put a leader in charge of this. We've created this as a business, and we're going to put 30 to 40 commercial resources on the street in the U.S. in 2013 and get going by really scaling up this business. The next item is the RTLS penetration in Healthcare and some Security verticals, such as education and financial services. Taking Healthcare as an example, we're creating an RTLS-based ecosystem, stitching together the other parts and pieces that we have in our Healthcare business today, such as patient security, asset management, asset tracking, storage. And we are going to, again, add about 30 to 40 high-level sales executives on the street, blanket the U.S. with folks that can call on the C-suite folks in acute care facilities and present to them our differentiated value proposition, which can help them take out cost, improve their safety and security and also help them with the revenue recognition and compliance with the new and changing regulations that ObamaCare and other legislation brings to bear. This is a very high value-added business, leverages our technology, and it will be growing at a very fast rate within several quarters. The next area is the U.S. government. It seems like a strange time perhaps to be scaling up to go after the U.S. government business but quite the opposite for us since we haven't really ever earned our fair share of U.S. Government business primarily because, historically, our go-to-market strategy has not been aligned properly. After intensive study of this issue, we have determined that we can make significant progress despite whatever spending cuts might be coming along in this area in Healthcare, Security and Industrial. And so we're redefining our go-to-market strategy. And basically, the idea here is instead of having a few people sitting in Washington hunting elephants, we're going to increase coverage at the local level, at the bases and the other places out there across America where the purchase decisions are actually made. And the Washington teams will be repurposed to go after market and business development and provide leads and provide intelligence to the folks out in the field. And not only that, but the government specialists in the field will be working hand-in-hand with the regular sales reps in those businesses. So it's really going to be quite a different approach. And we're already organizing around that as we speak. The next area is offshore oil and gas. This is an exciting opportunity in the CRC business, which already has a pretty strong -- the #1 position in what we do in welding and coating and inspection in offshore. And this simply takes it to a new level by growing both in the areas I mentioned, but also by establishing portable factory coating units and portable spool-based capabilities, which nobody else has today. And we have some terrific know-how and innovative ideas here as to how to do that, and we've actually developed some prototypes. And we already have the strong customer relationships with customers, such as Subsea 7 and Technip, the big pipeline companies out there. And they're excited and we're excited about pursuing this opportunity together. And each one of these opportunities that I've talked about so far has about $100 million run rate to it over the period. And then finally, we'll continue to capture the BDK integration revenue synergies that have been out there the whole time, and we've been working on them. And we've done quite well. We're already at about a $315 million level, and you can see some of the organic growth that I did discuss derived from that. However, with the integration coming to a close here over the next quarter or 2, we want to make sure that we capture the remaining $50 million that we think is left there. And so there's a few things there on the page, such as expanding Black & Decker Hand Tools, the DeWalt Hand Tool expansion and so forth, that we will pursue. And I -- it would be remiss of me not to mention, though, that frankly, the entire emerging market opportunity derives from putting these companies together because prior to that time, we really didn't have sufficient scale to go after the emerging markets the way we have -- are able to now. So I'll talk about that more in just a minute. But in any event, we have a solid list of initiatives here with a high level of confidence that they can be executed effectively. And why do we have this level of confidence? Number one, because the market opportunities are real. And secondly, in each case, we are uniquely qualified to exploit them. And third, we're implying what I think is a very sound approach to execution here. And the first part of it is that we're funding the initiatives through what I'll call long-term productivity improvements or strategic cost initiatives. We've embarked upon a journey to implement design-to-value techniques in our CDIY business, which will enable us to take out something in the order of about $100 million of costs over a 3-year period. And then we're also elevating the capabilities of our global sourcing team to go beyond traditional sourcing and really take it to the next level, which includes things like clean sheet analysis that we take to vendors, and we explain to them that their costs are not in line with where they need to be from a world-class standpoint. Or -- and so either they're getting too much margin in our relationship, or they don't have the capability or the designs that will achieve the clean sheet objectives, in which case we can help them in that regard. So that, too, will generate $50 million to $100 million of benefit. And then there's -- in addition to that, there's some structural reductions, primarily as we adjust our factory footprint in Europe, that will take place over time. And most of these benefits will kick in, in the '14 to '15 time frame. But they will be sufficient to fund the growth initiatives that generate the $1 billion revenue over 3 years, with some timing issues, of course, as the cost benefits are realized. So that's the first element, is that we want to make these programs self-funding through some cost takeouts, because the dilemma here is how do you invest in growth at the same time that you have a low-growth external environment, and that's what we're trying to solve here. And then the other part of this is that we're attacking this challenge to drive growth the way we've discussed here with a methodology that is very, very similar to what we have done with our acquisition integration, which has become a core competency of the company. So we're program-managing this with the integration methodology. We've got a small, dedicated corporate team that is overseeing these initiatives and coordinating with the business units that are actually driving them, helping allocate resources and removing the obstacles to growth. We have seasoned team leaders that are in the field reporting to the businesses that are accountable for execution. John Lundgren, myself, Don Allan, our senior HR folks are -- will be conducting biweekly steering committee meetings beginning in the fourth quarter. We have robust scorecards and tracking tools exactly analogous to the ones that we utilize for acquisition integrations. And we have a very controlled and efficient resource allocation review and approval process, but it is also one that has kind of a fast track so that we don't end up with big delays. Now I promised to talk a little bit more about the emerging markets and I will right now. This is a great opportunity. Frankly, we're doing pretty well at it already. This page just outlines how -- what the numbers are by region. You can see the largest is Latin America, then the Middle East and Africa, and then China and so forth. As you get into Southeast Asia, India, Russia, you can see we clearly have a lot of opportunity there. And -- but when you add it all up, it's been a great growth story. Now this is excluding HHI and pro forma for Infastech, but it just shows you that on that basis, 2012 would be about $1.6 billion or 16% of the company and almost 17%, growing at about a 20% rate over a 3-year period with 20% operating margin. And that's driving over $300 million of growth a year. And obviously, it's a nice compounding effect that actually increases the percent of total, particularly given the fact that the developing countries are not growing anywheres near this rate. So I think kudos to the people that have been working on this for years and also the Black & Decker strength that they brought in Latin America and Middle East, in particular. We've got a great team working on it already. The approach is generating good benefits. But with the growth initiatives that we are now embarking upon, we will -- actually, it will enable us to increase the CAGR of our efforts here by somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 to 10 points over run rate, and almost certainly ensure that we blow through the goals that we've set on a long-term basis for the company. So we're actually undertaking a radical change to the approach to the emerging markets, and I'll go through this fairly quickly. But we're going from incrementally investing in these markets to a major commitment to resource to the size and the scope of the opportunity. We're funding it, as I described, through this initiative. We're moving from a business unit-centric center of gravity to a regionally led center of gravity, and we're appointing a corporate officer to lead all the emerging markets. Now I've said that we're doing a good job already, and we've got good people leading these efforts and teams already today, so we're simply overlaying a corporate officer over that structure to make sure that we coordinate and we actually execute effectively and maximize and optimize the resource allocation and the best practices across these markets. Then we're moving from high-price-point Western-design products, which generally represents about 10% to 20% of the market in most of these markets to a mid-price-point product approach, which is, on the average, about 70% of the -- of these emerging markets. And we need to be able to do this to have the products designed by folks that are in these regions because the Western engineers really don't have it within their DNA to scale down the products and to kind of orient the products to the local markets the way they need to be, especially as it relates to the mid-price-point products. So we're moving from a kind of tweaking our designs to conform to what we think are the needs of the emerging markets to actually completely redesigning new products to attack the mid-price-point segment of the market. We're also going from reinventing the local MPP product lines in each emerging market to one globally coordinated effort, again, with the help from that corporate officer. But also through 3 new product SBUs with global emerging markets responsibility: one in Power Tools, one in Hand Tools and one in Commercial Hardware. All these SBUs are located in the emerging markets, the leaders have already been appointed, and they're off and running. We're also going from a limited product line and MPP to one that was -- and one that was generally sourced to one -- to full product lines of the MPP segment internally manufactured in local markets. And to do that, we need to blanket China, India, Brazil and Turkey with local plants. We just acquired Bajaj in India, which is a power tool plant in India. That's our first foray into that. We have a plant in Brazil. We have a plant -- several plants in China, so we're in good shape there. We need plants in Turkey and some of the other areas. In some cases, we need a hand tool plant in addition to a power tool plant, et cetera, but that is all captured within either our acquisition strategy for emerging markets or the $50 million of CapEx that I mentioned earlier. And then we're going from an under-resourced commercial organization to one that's sized to the market opportunity. What that implies is the addition of 300 to 400 commercial resources throughout the emerging markets over the next year or 2. And finally, we're going from an approach where the CDIY business is separately going after these markets and the IAR business is separately going after these markets, and they're kind of running into each other sometimes because the channels -- many of these markets don't recognize the distinction between the 2, the one unified effort focused on gaining profitable market share. And to do that, we're actually creating an internal joint venture between the IAR business and the CDIY business, where we can marshal the resources from both of those organizations and really focus on what's important to driving share gains in those regions and not into internal discussions about who gets credit for what. So we're going to have a little Board of Directors, internal Board of Directors with governance from CDIY, IAR and corporate and should work really well. So a really exciting initiative, which is already in progress and will be in full gear by mid-2013. And I will finish this by saying that we have put this company in a position to execute this opportunity through the Black & Decker-Stanley merger. We are now the only tool and hardware company with sufficient scale to exploit this opportunity to its fullest. And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. Before I move to the 2012 outlook, I just want to touch on free cash flow on Page 14. As you can see, our free cash flow for the third quarter was approximately $170 million; and year-to-date, almost $465 million. For those of you who are familiar with the trends and the seasonality of our working capital and cash flow, you're well aware that a large part of our cash flow does occur in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. And so in this particular case, the working capital through 9 months, or September 30 of this year, is a negative of $286 million. So it's a little larger than we would normally see in this time frame, but, however, it is on track with our expectations because we do believe that we will be at somewhere between 7.5 and 8 turns by the end of this year. And as a result, we'll see anywhere from $400 million to $500 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter just from working capital, pretty much in line with our expectations, as well as the seasonality that does occur, had met a large part of the revenue, in particular, in our CDIY business occurs in the month of October and into early stages of November. And then it slows down in the month of December, which allows for reductions of inventory, as well as collection of many of our receivables within -- or by the end of the fourth quarter. Another thing to keep in mind as you look at the trending and where we are through 9 months is if you look back in history, I've reminded folks of this over the last few years, is that fourth quarter tends to represent anywhere from 50% to 65% of the total year's free cash flow. And if you look at those factors, that would just extrapolate to approximately $1 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow for the year. So based on our forecast, based on our plans for working capital, we feel comfortable that our $1.2 billion of annual free cash flow is achievable. So with that, I'd like to move to 2012 outlook and give an update on our latest assumptions. As you saw in this morning's press release, our new estimate for EPS this year is $5.25 versus our prior range of $5.40 to $5.65. It's based on the following key assumptions. The first one is organic revenue, and this is pro forma organic revenue, so it assumes Niscayah was part of the base in 2011. We previously guided 1% to 2% organic revenue for the year. We believe now that will be approximately 1% for many of the pressures that you heard about from both John and Jim earlier in this call. In particular, though, our Industrial European businesses are seeing a great deal of revenue, organic revenue, pressure, as well as some of our MAS businesses, in particular, MAS Commercial businesses. That combination of those businesses, which are very high profitable businesses with lower volumes, as well as having a negative mix because of the high profitability of those businesses, is resulting in a $0.30 EPS pressure or headwind to our previous estimate for 2012. This provides us, and what that implies, is that for the fourth quarter our organic volume will actually be slightly down, probably approximately a negative 1%. Looking at the segments, to give you a little sense of what they'll be for the year. We still believe that CDIY will continue to be approximately mid-single digits. Security will be down low single digits, as we previously indicated in July, but Industrial will be flat for the year for organic growth, where we're expecting to see some low single-digit growth back in July. And that's really where we're seeing a significant amount of the change versus our July expectations and today. The second factor that we're updating is based on all the growth initiatives that Jim just walked you through, we will incur approximately $15 million of operating expenses in the fourth quarter, and so that's really beginning to get these initiatives started. Jim talked about some of the hires that we've already done, so it's reflected in those numbers. It's really about getting more feet on the street, as well as creating some more infrastructure in emerging markets. The third area that we're updating is we do expect a slight positive associated with FX rates. When we talked in July, we had seen a big drop in the euro, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, in particular, that drove about a $0.35 negative to our expectations for the year. We think we'll call about $0.10 of that back in the fourth quarter, if rates stay where they are today, because we have seen a tick-up of about 5% to 6% in those 3 currencies in the later stages of September. We didn't experience much of the benefit in Q3, but if the rates hold we would expect about a $0.10 benefit for Q4. We're maintaining other assumptions. Specifically when you look at organic growth by region, we're relatively in line with our expectations, but the mix within North America and Europe is quite different, as I just mentioned. The emerging markets will be at the low end of our range but still growing nicely but just at slower paces than we have seen in the previous 2 years but in line with our expectations that we created in early January. Cost synergies were both related to Black & Decker and Niscayah continue to hold firm at $115 million and $45 million, as well as the other cost actions we completed in January and July of this year, that totaled $200 million. Our tax rate in Q3 was a little bit lower than our expectation, so for the year, we still expect to be at 22.5%, so in line with our previous guidance in July. So you can see at the bottom of the page, if you take the midpoint of the previous range, add the 3 factors or major changes, it gets you to that $5.25, which is an implied fourth quarter EPS of $1.45. So moving on to thoughts about 2013. And one of the things that we need to consider is the affect of the portfolio transformation of divesting HHI, the acquisition of Infastech, and what that impact will be. We have not factored that into our 2012 guidance that I just reviewed with you, as we will wait till these particular transactions close, which will either be late -- in late December or early January of next year. So to start with HHI. As you know, $1.4 billion of cash proceeds associated with that, which is a 7.5x multiple of LTM, which is approximately $186 million through June 30 of this year. The after-tax proceeds are expected to be about $1.3 billion, so a relatively small tax cost due to the tax basis we have in the United States, in particular, so the tax is primarily related to the small international piece of the business. And we believe, on an annual basis, the dilutive impact to our company will be approximately $0.60 in EPS. The proceeds that we'll actually receive here in the U.S. of that $1.4 billion is approximately $1.1 billion. And what are we going to do with those proceeds? How are we going to utilize them? As we've indicated previously, we wanted to make sure that we took a large portion of it and did some share repurchases. So we're going to take approximately $700 million to $750 million of those proceeds to repurchase shares once the transaction closes, like I mentioned in late December or early January. If you utilize a $75 stock price, which was our stock price when we announced the transaction in early October, it's approximately a $0.30 accretive benefit of buying back those shares. The other areas is utilizing some of these proceeds for the Infastech acquisition, in particular the U.S. portion of the acquisition. So approximately $300 million of that $1.1 billion will go towards that transaction, which we expect to close roughly in the same time frame. As a reminder, the accretion associated with Infastech is approximately $0.15 in 2013 assuming a full year and $0.35 by year 3. The remaining $550 million of purchase price will be financed by overseas cash, as well as some of the HHI offshore proceeds that are included in the $1.3 billion. And then a modest deleveraging of approximately $100 million is the remaining portion of that $1.1 million that we'll utilize. The net result of this on EPS is approximately, if you utilize the numbers I just went through, will be about $0.15. We've provided a range of $0.10 to $0.20 of annualized dilution given that there are some factors in here such as what will the stock price be when we purchase the stock back, as well as the dilutive impact could move slightly for the HHI. So it's going to range somewhere between $0.10 to $0.20, which is in line with our expectations, but not being a significant dilutive transformation of the portfolio. The good news from my perspective is we're taking approximately 70% of the onshore proceeds in utilizing that for share repurchase. So some other thoughts associated with 2013 here on Page 17. At this stage, we feel it's too early to comment on our 2013 views of organic growth. However, there are a few tailwinds and headwinds that are very apparent, which are in our direct control, and that's really what this page tries to highlight. The first is the tailwinds. We've taken various actions, as you know, and some of them are associated with acquisitions such as back in July, we indicated that we have $50 million of Black & Decker cost synergies that will occur in 2013, approximately $0.23 of EPS. We'll have incremental Niscayah cost synergies of $0.15 or $35 million in 2013 and then incremental cost actions, the actions we took in July that carry over into 2013 of $50 million. Strong tailwinds as you'll go into an environment that is still very difficult from an organic growth perspective. The headwinds will be the -- really be what I just reviewed to you, which is the net dilutive impact of HHI, Infastech and the share repurchase, which is anywhere from $0.10 to $0.20. Another factor to consider is we certainly expect commodity deflation to occur in 2013 based on current commodity prices. However, we do think that's primarily going to offset some of this mix headwind that we're experiencing, that we'll experience probably in the first half of 2013 if these trends continue. So that will be a net neutral impact. The net of all that is approximately $0.40 to $0.50 of net tailwinds going in 2013, which is not a bad place to be considering the difficult macroeconomic environment we're in today. Now Jim touched on the growth initiatives, and I just want to reinforce some comments that he made about the revenue for 2013 specifically. He mentioned $115 million in revenue in 2013 associated with these programs will probably have approximately $50 million of investments, operating costs -- investments in 2013, which means there'll be a neutral impact to 2013. It's really '14 and '15 that we would expect to see the benefits of both the cost initiatives that are funding this, as well as the continued growth of these growth initiatives, a $350 million incremental in '14 and '15. So to summarize this morning's presentation. We are investing in organic growth initiatives. We continue to look at the environment as difficult, and we don't see it changing significantly at least in the next few years. As a result, we're responding with these various initiatives that Jim went through in great amount of detail earlier today. The continued volume retractions we see are affecting our profitable businesses, therefore, they've affected our guidance for 2012. We feel that we've taken very sufficient cost actions in both January and July, but they were not enough to stop the deterioration. However, it's not time now to take more costs out. It's time to invest in areas where we can really spur some organic growth in this company. And we're investing in $15 million of organic growth initiatives in the fourth quarter that will help kickstart and jump these programs that we just walked through. The focus here is really on the long-term benefits for the businesses and, ultimately, our shareholders. And we really think this is an important step to move forward in the attainment of our mid-decade goals. And last thing I'll mention is Niscayah and Black & Decker integrations continue to be very successful, and we're pleased with where they are at this stage. So with that, that concludes the presentation portion of the call, and move to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jason Feldman from UBS.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: First, just briefly, I understand it's early for you to be willing to comment on organic growth. But on the headwinds and tailwinds for 2013, there were 2 that were absent that I would have expected. One is FX headwinds based on current rates, kind of what you think that could be -- at least, in the first half, I would expect kind of some sort of modest headwind? And also I think you touched about AeroScout and Powers Fasteners being accretive next year to some degree or another. I think it was $0.10.
Donald Allan: I would say the FX components, actually, were pretty much back to the level we experienced early in the year for most of the major currencies. So we don't see a lot of FX headwinds based on current rates going in 2013. As far as the other acquisitions, I would say, yes, they're kind of in the net neutral category. We didn't call them out because it's a relatively small number, but when you look at the impact of commodity deflation, the mix headwind and those acquisitions, they'd all be in that kind of bottom category that I called net neutral.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Really appreciate all the comments and detail. I had a question about the emerging markets strategy. You mentioned that the 2012e [ph] was also pro forma for Infastech. It looks like that Infastech revenues, and I believe you said Asia Pac was about $270 million or so, are there any other acquisitions in that number? I'm trying to get to the organic growth number. And I guess, looking forward, as you continue to expect to build that business, I assume there'd be -- it would be good contribution from acquisitions as well as organic growth.
James M. Loree: Yes, I mean, the numbers are pro forma. So the -- whatever Infastech was in 2012 would be in the base as well. And as far as the acquisition strategy for Stanley right now, it is almost exclusively on emerging markets. And we tend to be looking for power tool, hand tool, commercial hardware and Electronic Security acquisitions, which are very relatively small, in most cases, less than $100 million but very strategic on a one-off basis in a given market. We really feel that some of these companies have strong local distribution, which when combined with our product and manufacturing expertise that we're developing, or the manufacturing expertise that we have and the product expertise in the emerging markets that we're developing, can be very powerful. So yes, it will be supplemented through some acquisition. None of that is included in the organic growth rate numbers that I shared, obviously, that would be in incremental to that.
John F. Lundgren: And Mike, this is John. Just so you don't get cut off, I mean, Jim referenced a plant acquisition, which was really a manufacturing base in India. That's a good example of the kind of thing Jim's talking about. And collectively, we have spent a lot of time on target identification and development. Jim has spent, with mine and Don's and our board's full support, a tremendous amount of his time focused on emerging markets in the last 3 to 6 months because, as you know, these relationships, large or small, have a far longer incubation period than, say, a North American acquisition. So that's all part of the thought process. But importantly, the focus is in emerging markets on business development but it's small. Our hiatus on significant acquisition activity going forward remains, because we're going to focus on organic growth. And as I said, we're going to run it. I think Jim explained it really well, we're going to run it like we run a large integration, because that's a model that's tested and proven within our 4 walls, and it looks well for us.
Operator: The next question is from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: The CDIY growth number was in line, a good performance. Can you just give us a little more color on what you're seeing in that market in the U.S. in terms of growth, in terms of your share performance, in terms of price competition and promotions, just a little more color on what you're seeing in that important business?
James M. Loree: Yes, basically, I think, we're outperforming the market, for sure, in the U.S. Probably, market may be up 1 to 2 points at this point, and, I think, given our performance, a couple of points higher than that. Most of it is coming from the things that I referenced, the cordless, in particular, in Professional Power Tools and to some extent in CPG. But also the -- now we're getting the introduction of the very innovative products that we have in CPG, the Matrix and the Gyro. I think that will definitely be, again, outperformance in the marketplace. And then, the revenue synergies from Hand Tools, in particular, with respect to the DeWalt tools, are also kind of differentiating us in the share point of view. So we're probably outperforming by a couple of points there.
John F. Lundgren: And Eric, the second part of your question, we're seeing no abnormal level of promotion or price activity, comfortable at that level. As you know, there's been some commodity deflation, which is helping margins, but not so much that it's placed a tremendous pressure on price. And fourth quarter, there's a tiny bit of seasonality in the consumer piece, but that has been what's driving our business. So right now, I think, another thing that's always an area of interest, our best view in our top meetings with customers is inventories are at a very normal level. The data is so much better, both at the customer base and internally, and the ability to share it transparently, because nobody wins when the channels are stuffed, and nobody wins when they are out of stock, as you all know. We see inventories as of mid-October approaching a busy season up in -- prior to, I'll say, the December doldrums as quite normal.
Operator: And the next question is from Dan Oppenheim from Crédit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: When you're talking about the emerging markets, you can -- you had shown that Latin American and Middle East being 75% of the emerging market revenue. When you think about the growth initiatives, how much is going to be focused on those regions versus the rest of the world in terms of emerging markets and thinking about sort of what we need to achieve then in terms of growth there, and also what you're thinking getting sort of organic revenue growth in Latin America and Middle East without more initiatives?
James M. Loree: Yes, well, clearly, the resource allocation will be towards the larger markets that are -- that we're currently underweight in today. I think where we -- in Latin America and Middle East, Africa -- well, Middle East, I'll say, we have excellent coverage, sales coverage. And really the key there is just we can -- and we have pretty good MPP products that we've developed locally in both those cases. However, in some cases, the products are sourced, so the products that we will manufacture in local markets is -- that's part of the strategy there, and then just to leverage the resources that we have in the market today in those large markets that we're already pretty overweight in. In the underweight markets, it is absolute majority, probably 70% to 80% of the resource allocation will go there. It's all about getting the right products with our SBUs and then basically flooding the market with feet on the street that can develop the distribution channels to drive share growth in those markets. China, India, obviously, are the 2 biggest. But I will tell you, I just got back from Russia, Turkey, Dubai and some other countries earlier in the year. And some of these kind of medium-sized markets that I'm talking about really offer enormous potential, and it's really just about getting the right products and getting the feet on the street. The brands that we have are phenomenal. The recognition of the brands is amazing. The markets are hungry for some market development, and we're going to provide it.
John F. Lundgren: And Dan, this is John. Just to follow up and certainly, hopefully, just expands what Jim just said in a very simple manner. As you know, or some of you know, I've spent 14 years of my career living and working abroad. And as Jim, myself, the business leaders huddled to talk about the organic growth opportunity, I guess we always knew, but we've come to the realization that one size doesn't fit all, and that's really been the model that we've been using, which is why we elevated it as a corporate priority. But simply said, it's going to be different in each and every one of those markets. But I think Jim just said it well. It's what's the customer's focal point? It's going to be different in each of those markets depending on its degree of development. What is the product design? We can't simply design one product in Towson, Maryland and dummy it down a little bit and sell it all over the world. So there's 3 engineering centers around the world that are going to drive this activity. And last, but absolutely not least, how we are organized. And Jim described that in great detail, but who is accountable, who's accountable in the region, what's his or her relationship with the relevant business and with corporate, and then finally, how do we track it? So that's nothing different than what Jim said. But I think to summarize it, it is a -- it's a new approach for us, but it's one that we believe it's tested and proven. We've got a lot of experience behind it. And I think we've just validated it with the work we've done with consultants, advisors and, most important, our own team, over the last 3 or 4 months.
Operator: And the next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley.
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So I just want to ask a little bit about 4Q, the implied 4Q guidance. So it looks like you're now looking for a modest organic decline in 4Q, and the bulk of that is driven by a little bit of weakening within the Industrial segment. So it would be really helpful to get some color around your expectations Q-on-Q for IAR versus Fastening, what's driving the weakening?
Donald Allan: Yes, Nicole, it's Don. What I mentioned was that we saw in the third quarter that all of our Industrial European businesses retracted. We expect that to continue at a slightly worse trend, so we would imagine that IAR would retract a little bit more than we saw in Q3. Engineered Fastening will probably have saw 7% growth rate overall. In Europe, they were down 3%. That will be slightly larger as the Industrial European piece of that business, which is not tied to automotive manufacturing, will be down high single digits, maybe double digits at this stage. And then we'll see probably a flat performance with European auto business for Engineered Fastening. So those businesses are expected to experience a fair amount of pressure. There's a little bit of our Infrastructure business in Europe, as well, which will be pressured, but that's not a significant number.
Operator: And the next question is from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just a follow-up on the last question, which you addressed for the European businesses. How much of the cut is kind of related to what you're referring to in the U.S. in locks and doors? And are you really seeing a delay of backlog, so you have it, or is it just that it's kind of weaker backlog? And sticking on the U.S., the recent transfer of Apex to new a owner. You guys have had stellar results in the business that had problems if you go back 5 years ago. So do you think Apex's new owner is likely to bring more margin pressures as they seek to regain market share?
James M. Loree: I guess 2 points. Ken, the backlog I referred to is primarily in convergence security, not mechanical locking. The issue that Brett's team is dealing with in mechanical locking is that the market got smaller and faced tough economic times. There was a tremendous move from premium to mid-price point. And full disclosure, our mid-priced point offering was not up to snuff, and the teams worked very hard to get that developed in the marketplace and it's there. That's on the Mechanical Security side. The backlog conversion is simply the orders are there, we've got to get them converted, we've got the installations done, we've got to get them done right the first time. And that's one of the things that led to a management change within our Convergent Security business, where within the last 6 months, we've -- 2 internal, 1 external -- have added 3 senior leaders to Brett Bontrager's team to accomplish that. Regarding Apex, it's not our role to speculate on competitors and what their new owners will do. It's quite a, I'll say, diverse portfolio of brands, many of which are secondary and tertiary. That in and of itself is a challenge. Joint ventures are a challenge. And so as a consequence, we felt that -- we don't think that was a major factor, the Apex joint venture, in our ability to gain share. And I would think that's not going to be a major factor going forward. It's an interesting business. It's in good hands from a very, very professional private equity owners. Talk to them about their strategy as opposed to us. It's not our place to speculate.
James M. Loree: I think the only thing I would add is that it's -- of all the various outcomes that could have occurred, it's probably the best for us because they are rational people. They are highly levered. And they will pursue some growth opportunities for sure, but there's plenty of opportunities out there for 2 of us. So I think it's probably in a very good place. And it will probably be for sale in a couple of years, too, so we'll have a look at it then.
Operator: And the next question is from Mike Wherley from Janney Capital Markets.
Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I was just looking at Latin America, and it's been very strong for you guys despite some slowing of GDP growth in Brazil. Now I was just wondering, how much of your growth in Latin America is from the BDK revenue synergies, and how much is from countries outside of Brazil?
John F. Lundgren: There's -- BDK revenue synergies are not just Brazil, Mike. You've kind of asked 2 questions that are hard to answer. Brazil is 65% of our Latin American business. And roughly 65% of the growth has come in Brazil and 35% has come outside. The overwhelming majority of all of that growth, think of it as BDK revenue synergies, specifically Black & Decker, legacy Black & Decker had a very capable manufacturing plant with a very capable local leader, well-established commercial teams and distribution channels in all markets in Latin America, and a very capable business leader in Jaime Ramirez. And what we've been able to do is leverage 2 things. Production in Brazil but for -- it serves all of Latin America through the -- our Uberaba plant where we've been able to do some simple hand tool assembly and production there, number one. And number two, take very, very popular but previously cost competitive black and yellow Stanley products that were imported that are now managed and sold locally through a well-established distribution channel. That's been the big lift. So simply said, the business is pro rata with the size of the markets. And you can contribute the overwhelming majority of that to what we do refer to as the Black & Decker revenue synergy.
Operator: And the next question is from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Research: Security margins are tough for us to model given the mix shift that you mentioned in the Niscayah integration. Last quarter in the conference call, you talked about flat operating margins in Security for the full year. It looks like that may have come down. So can you walk us through what's changed in the Security side since last quarter on the margins?
Donald Allan: Yes, I would say that the big thing that's changed is really the impact of what we're talking about around MAS Commercial. So that's clearly creating what we are calling a negative mix impact to the company, but it's also true for the Security segment. So we saw, as Jim mentioned, a really solid performance in Security from a rate perspective given those pressures, but we would expect it to, sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter, retract a little bit more given those pressures and probably, obviously, will be down slightly total year when you look at it versus expectation of flat back in July.
Operator: And the next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: As you guys think about the organic growth initiatives, historically, obviously, have been focused on acquisitions and that's a bit of a cultural change. Can you talk about what you're doing internally either from an incentive compensation structure, other initiatives to change that culture or shift that culture to an organic growth focus that can be sustainable even beyond when you go back to M&A?
John F. Lundgren: Yes, Dennis, it's a very fair and, I think, appropriate question. 8 or 9 years ago, I implemented, with obviously the tremendous support of Jim Loree, who is already here with our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mathieu, our head of HR, organic growth as a significant portion of the short-term incentive for the entire management team. It made good sense. There were very specific goals for each and every business. And we carried on for 4 or 5 years, I think, with tremendous success, both organically and via acquisition, which is where we deployed most of our -- 2/3 of our cash flow. As we faced what was clearly going to be some really tough economic times, 2008, '09 -- 2007, '08, '09, quite frankly, some very thoughtful and experienced board members led us to the conclusion -- or helped us to the conclusion that it was going to be very difficult to grow organically in that environment, and protecting our balance sheet, focusing on cash flow was a very important thing to do to weather that storm. It's exactly what we did. That was the initiative or the driver, if you will, behind SFS, which has generated tremendous amounts of cash and, quite frankly, I think it's why Stanley was in the position to acquire Black & Decker. As Jim pointed out, we didn't think that would last 5 years, but it has. And rather than continuing to work focused just on cash flow, on income conversion, we've decided, if you will, to take organic growth into our own hands. So the simple answer to your question is yes. Anyone and everyone involved in this, a significant portion of their short-term compensation will be based on profitable organic growth. The exact specifics to that, I'm not going to reveal at this stage. It will be in our proxy that we publish next February. But it will be a specific part, and there'll be a select -- a precious few number of individuals. And Jim talked about how this team was staffed and organized. There'll be a handful of individuals that the overwhelming majority of their incentive will be based on that, but that will be specific to the initiative.
James M. Loree: Yes, another element to this is, which is not compensation-related, or at least it is indirectly, is that we are a very, very tightly managed company when it comes to P&Ls, and especially at the business level and the region level. In both cases, when there are revenue shortfalls, the initial reflex in the organization is to cut costs. And frequently, the businesses were attempting to make emerging market growth investments, but when the cost cutting kind of came to bear, typically, emerging markets were not unscathed, although we directed them to minimize that, they just couldn't help themselves because they are measured on P&L and they're very capable people when it comes to delivering those kinds of results. So the overlay that we've created here by absolutely making the investments at more of a corporate level or at least corporate oversight level, we can protect those investments, and we have to kind of sort of put our armor on and kind of get through -- if the environment gets tough, we have to protect these investments, and we will. And that will be a big difference. The other thing is with respect to kind of creating the center of gravity at the region level, you don't have the same incentives to cut costs that you would in the emerging markets that you would if you are running a business that had a global footprint because -- and you are measured on a quarterly P&L. In the emerging markets, your -- the measurements of these individuals are going to be -- well, yes, they are going to be P&L focused. There's going to be a clear understanding between them and us at the corporate level that our expectation is that we achieve organic growth and we do that with investments and the investments are protected. So there's a couple of other subtleties there beyond just direct compensation that we're addressing through this change.
Operator: And the next question is from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Question regarding the sale of HHI, receiving a 7.5 multiple on EBITDA, whereas the -- at least the housing pure-play comparables that are publicly traded are considerably above that. I know you guys are very savvy as it relates to capital markets, you're very thoroughly advised. I was just curious as to the reasoning behind selling it privately versus a potential carve-out or going to the public markets for that. Was it because the market wouldn't bear it based on your research or data fact that you were getting immediate cash created that decision? Just a little bit of background, if you could.
James M. Loree: I think 7.5x, when you really look at that business, I think, is a very fair price. And spinning it didn't make a whole lot of sense given all the extra cost and the fact that it's a very tax efficient transaction. If you look at the composition of the portfolio, the one thing that is, perhaps, underappreciated is that $200 million of that business was Pfister. And Pfister, we attempted to sell on its own and frankly couldn't get it done at anything over 5x multiple, and that would have been a victory if we could have gotten that and would have required seller paper and a number of other things. And we finally just said, the heck with that, let's mix it in with HHI locks and so forth. And so you have to kind to think of it in terms of we got, for what really is the heart and soul of that portfolio, we got something closer to 8.5x. And that's a pretty good price in relation to -- especially the after-tax proceeds that we received for that.
John F. Lundgren: It's also a highly profitable business, Sam. And I mean, it's just math. One of the reasons 7.5 doesn't look meteoric relative to some of the comps that you're comparing to is this is $186 million or $190 million EBITDA business. There aren't a lot of housing pure plays, to use your words, with those kind of EBITDA margins. And lastly, not so much the multiple or the margin or how to sell it, we just -- we wanted as disruptive a process as possible because this is an ongoing business that if we didn't sell it successfully, we wanted as little disruption as possible, because it was a business that had then turned around nicely and was performing well. But lastly, remember, this is primarily a design source and ship business. And to Jim's point, Pfister is 100% design source and ship business. Not that we can't do that. We're a manufacturing company and we think we do it pretty well, between global sourcing, product design and production. And that lever for us and ability to further improve the business really didn't exist in this business, and that was part of the driver. But at the end of the day, we're really happy with the...
James M. Loree: Yes. And there's also a missed perception with respect HHI being so tied to the housing market. When you look at the company's exposure to construction before and after HHI, it is still right in the 30% zone. And the fact is that HHI is a replacement business for the most part. It is not a new construction business. You look at channels that it sells into, they are not going into the builder market for the most part. They're going into replacement, remodel, those types of markets. So we haven't really changed the complexion of our portfolio dramatically as it relates to exposure to the construction market. And the market would not have viewed this business as a construction pure play, very important point, which would indicate that we got a very fair price for it, as was mentioned.
Operator: And the next question is from Richard Kwas from Wells Fargo.
Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just a follow-up on '13 in terms of your initial outlook. When you're assuming for Europe, and I know it's early and you're giving formal guidance in January, but should we assume that Europe is down similarly in '13 or is that how you're thinking about the business right now, and that could be offset by the U.S. and then some of the revenue and cost synergies that you have factored in. Is that the right way to think about it?
Donald Allan: Well, as I mentioned, Rich, we're not really giving thoughts on organic guidance for 2013. There's just too many factors out there that are going to change, most likely, over the next 90 days. There's things in Europe, there's things in the United States, et cetera. And as a result, we're not really giving thoughts. But I think if you look at what's happening to us in Europe this year, there's no reason to suddenly indicate we're going to see growth in the first quarter of 2013 in Europe. So I think you can use it from that perspective and look at our overall portfolio, but there's going to be variations that happen in the next 90 days. Things like the fiscal cliff in the United States, that we don't know the impact of that, and the U.S. economy, the continued crisis in Europe, and the Eurozone, as to what will happen with Spain and how that might impact business in that particular area. And then slow growth in China and emerging markets as well. So it all goes back to the theme that we started with, which is that we don't -- the macroeconomic environment is not real robust. And overall, when you look at it, doesn't feel like you're going to see a lot of growth beyond 1 or 2 points. So we're looking to stimulate it with these growth programs, which is what we've tried to focus on this morning and get people to recognize that we're taking action in response to an environment that we don't see changing, or improving dramatically, going forward.
Operator: And the next question is from Michael Kim from Imperial Capital.
Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Just a specific to Niscayah. Can you talk a little about the organic growth profile and how much of that headwind is from project rationalization versus the macro environment, particularly in Europe? And what you guys can do on your own actions to keep more of a flatter growth -- or flatter organic profile and potentially gain some share?
Donald Allan: Sure. I think when you look at the pro forma and Niscayah business being down, roughly 5%, I think it's an actual -- it's a pretty good performance given the macro environment in Europe, in particular, given that they're really shifting to a more profitable business model around installation, revenues, as well as trying to drive more recurring revenues into the business model long-term. They'll be down 5% versus our expectation of 7% or even possibly 10%, we think it's a great story. But we would imagine that, that type of situation would continue probably into the early stages of next year and then, depending on the macroeconomic environment, would start to improve. If you look at the 5% today, I would say that probably at least 1/2 of it is due to the macro environment and the other 1/2 is more due to the model shift.
Operator: And the last question will be from Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Lots of moving parts here, but if we could look at 2013, and, Don, if you could maybe give us a little color on the puts and takes for the free cash flow conversion for the year, and maybe if you could include any sort of pension impact and what the preliminary outlook there might be would be very helpful.
Donald Allan: Sure. I mean, I don't have a precise view on free cash flow of 2013, but if you want to get a little input, I would expect that we would imagine we would have continued improvement in working capital next year, and our expectation is usually about 1/2 a turn as we go into the year. We will be making more capital investments related to emerging markets to make sure we have the right products in the different countries that we walked through this morning. So that could be a little bit of pressure but even with that, I still think we'll have improvement in working capital turns in 2013. There's no major pension fundings beyond the current run rate that would pressure 2013, that would be a new item. So I would expect, based on continued accretion in our earnings, continued improvement in working capital, we would expect that our free cash flow would go -- be accretive to the $1.2 billion that we're experiencing this year.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's call. I will now turn the call back to Kate Vanek for closing remarks.

Operator: Welcome to the Q2 2012 Stanley Black & Decker Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sandra, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kate Vanek. Ms. Vanek, you may begin.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Thank you so much, Sandra, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning for the Stanley Black & Decker Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, President and CEO; Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO; Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Senior Vice President and Group Executive of CDIY. Our earnings release which was issued this morning, and a supplemental presentation which we'll refer to during the call, are available on the IR portion of our website as well as our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of the call will be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim, Don and Jeff will review Stanley's 2012 second quarter results and various other topical matters, followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As always, please feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions that you have after today's call. And as I normally have to do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act. And with that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Kate, and thank you for being with us this morning. And for those of you who have been able to read this morning's press release, I suspect you all have concluded that the strength in our CDIY business as well as continued success with our primarily Black & Decker and Niscayah integration has helped to mute some of the economic and currency headwinds in the second quarter that had a somewhat greater effect on our Industrial and Security platforms. So much more detail to come. Revenues were up 8%, $2.8 billion. Importantly, organic growth up 2%. Strong performance in CDIY, up 5% organically with an operating margin rate x M&A charges and payments of 15.7%. The Industrial and Security segments were pressured by certain weak vertical markets, as well as their presence in Europe. And you'll hear more detail on all 3 segments in just a few minutes, so I won't spend more time on that in the overview. 2Q diluted EPS, $1.32, again x charges, $0.92 on a GAAP basis. Continued positive news and strong momentum on the Black & Decker integration, which we now expect to yield an incremental $50 million in cost synergies next year, 2013. That will bring the total to $500 million since our March 2010 commitment in closing as a combined company, and that's up from an original estimate of $350 million. We're not going to spend a lot of time on the synergies and the increment on this morning's call. Happy to discuss that, as is Kate, offline. But the 2 primary sort of drivers of the $50 million incremental saving were our global strategic sourcing organization continues to gain traction across a larger base and seeing some nice savings there. And some of the programs, as we said earlier, are major footprint initiatives that required factory moves, distribution center closures that were more complex and as a consequence filled with more inherent risk. They've gone extremely well, particularly in Europe. So the combination of those 2 things has given us the confidence to up that estimate by $50 million, and it's something we're very proud of and I'm very proud of the team and the many people involved in executing those changes. Revenue synergies continue to be important. FatMax power tools, you'll hear a little about from Jeff and Jim, DeWalt Hand Tools, those are those initiatives driving growth around the globe. The Niscayah integration also remains on track. Our pro forma Convergent Security margin in Europe is up 270 basis points year-on-year, and that continues to move towards the line average, but still with a great deal of room for improvement, but right on track from what we assumed and communicated upon closing that deal last September. We also have increased our dividend by 20%. That's the 45th consecutive annual dividend increase for our company, and that will bring the yield to about 3.3% based on yesterday's closing price. During the quarter, we also completed the $200 million share repurchase program. And the board has approved, our board has very recently approved a 20 million share or about a $1.2 billion share buyback program. So those are the highlights from the longer-than-normal release that we put out this morning. And let's move into the business in the 2Q and how it performed. First of all, in sources of growth, overall we had our 2% organic growth, which 1% from volume with the puts and calls that I discussed, more details later, and we got 1% in price, 10% from acquisitions, offset by minus 4% from foreign currency. Virtually every currency that's important to us, the euro, the GB pound, Brazilian real, Australian dollar, all went or continued to go in the wrong direction, and it is having some headwind that Don has factored into the outlook that he'll talk about later on, on this morning's call. Some great stories within the businesses. Professional Power Tools up 9%; Consumer Power Tools, which includes our outdoor business, which in fact was helped by the weather, up 9%. Lots of puts and calls within Industrial, globally up 1%, but you have our Engineered Fastening business showing double-digit growth, offset by some mid- to high-single digit declines in some of our other Industrial platforms that Jim will talk about in the segment detail. Hand Tools and Fasteners essentially flat. Convergent Security, including Niscayah, down 3%; MAS Commercial, 4%. Other Security, which is a combination of access, MAS, residential. Health care, a lot of small moving parts, down 5% off a low base. So some very good stories, particularly in CDIY and a very nice performance in our Engineered Fastening business around the globe. Looking at our geographies on the next slide, I'll take them from largest to smallest in terms of the representation of our revenues. So middle left, U.S., essentially a microcosm of our entire company, up 1%. It continues to represent slightly more than half of our revenue. Moving across the page, Europe in total down 2%. We could argue that's a victory or very strong performance if you think about the pieces. Europe CDIY, and Jeff will talk about it, up 2%, one of the best volume quarters or the best volume quarter since the third quarter of 2010. IAR Security down slightly. Niscayah down 5%, pretty much as we've predicted. Saw a relatively strong performance in Europe given the headwinds that, that geography's facing. Bottom left looking at Latin America, continued strong growth across most platforms, organically up 7%. Canada, important business for us, very strong performance, up 10% with Professional Power Tools and the lithium-ion platform, the DeWalt and Bostitch Hand Tools, as well as our outdoor business, all performing quite well during the quarter. Over the right side of the page very quickly, emerging markets in Asia or our emerging markets group as we define it, a small percentage of our company, only 3%, but continued steady solid growth, up 9%. Japan looks terrific, plus 31%. Remember, that's off a very low base of the tsunami-impacted Emhart business this time last year. But nonetheless, extraordinary recovery for our Engineered Fastening business, which represents the overwhelming majority of our business in Japan. And last but not least, Australia was down 9%. It only represents 2% of our revenue. Hand Tools holding up pretty well. Our Sidchrome professional mechanics tools business faced some pricing pressure, and it's one of the last geographies where we've completed or in the process of completing our technology shift from nickel cadmium to lithium-ion, so relatively late conversion. That's by design based on product availability, and we see that turning around in the very near future. Normally, Jim Loree would take us through all 3 segments, but as I suggested earlier and Kate mentioned, CDIY had an exceptionally strong quarter. And today we have Jeff Ansell, who's our Senior Vice President Group Executive responsible for CDIY, which represents about half our revenue on a global basis. He'll be with us on the call and Jeff, over to you for some highlights of CDIY in the quarter.
Jeffery D. Ansell: Thank you, John. As John indicated on Page 7, strong performance within the CDIY segment during Q2, driven by revenue growth and profit expansion. Some of the key points to make during the quarter, starting with revenue growth, total of 5% for the segment; 6% excluding Pfister, fueled as you can see in the upper left by power tools' performance. Across the regions, North America delivered high single-digit growth across both retail and industrial construction or IC channels, driven by power tools and outdoor products. Hand Tools also had a very good quarter, but difficult comp as compared to the prior year, DeWalt Hand Tool load-ins that occurred this time last year. EMEA 2% volume, driven by both hand and power tool expansion with particular strength in the U.K., Middle East, Africa and the Nordics, more than offsetting pressures in Italy and Spain, et cetera. Even with the known pressures across EMEA, we delivered our best volume quarter in that region since Q3 2010, as John indicated. Both North America and EMEA both positively comped the prior year load-ins from the 18/20 volt lithium-ion loads that occurred this time last year, so quite good progress. Latin America continued positive performance with strength in Columbia, Ecuador, Venezuela, more than offsetting pressures in places like Brazil and Argentina. Our emerging market's numbers in total were positive consistent with the recent track record, and I think the piece that gives us more pride than anything and probably reason for confidence going forward is that we had volume growth in every region of the world, excluding Australia and New Zealand, which is both small and improving, as John indicated. That revenue growth around the world also enabled, at least partially enabled, OM expansion of 140 basis points. Again, the combination of volume leverage, efficient promotional planning and cost synergy attainment concurrently all enabled that performance. If you turn to Page 8, perhaps a little deeper dive into the numbers from a quarter and a merger-to-date perspective. Starting in the upper left box, point of sale and average annual growth rates, we've spent a good deal of time talking about POS performance over time and repeatedly made the point that volumes and POS may not be consistent in a given month or a quarter but over time, they certainly counterbalance one another. We have attempted to depict that clearly for you all here that if you look at the 3-quarter performance, Q4 of 2011 through the first half of 2012, volumes were plus 5%; POS plus 4%, with inventories in relative balance. If you dissect that a little further on a year-to-date basis, volume's up 5, POS up 5 in perfect harmony. Since integration, the CDIY POS hasn't grown on average mid-single digits, with the DeWalt business in total more than 2x that rate. And then finally, the CDIY average annual growth rate, as compared to our key U.S. customers' comp store performance, so our U.S. volume versus key U.S. retailer comp performance, CDIY is plus 3.5% versus the average of the major customers at about 2.5%. So point to make would be clearly we feel like we're gaining share, but also our growth fuels our customers' growth and their growth clearly fuels our growth. Turning to the upper right quadrant in terms of market share, coming into this integration, we held the market-leading market share position globally. We've since added about 200 basis points of share over 2010 and '11 and obviously, those numbers are only reported annually, both years representing share gain. A point of note in the second bullet, and that is around DeWalt cordless. Over the time frame of the integration, the DeWalt cordless business has grown at 50% faster rate than global cordless in total to the highest level in history. We've never had a larger cordless business than we have today. Since the integration, our NiCad business or legacy platform has remained flat, while lithium-ion has grown 5x to commensurate size and profitability, giving us the strength in the market. Turning to the bottom left box in terms of profitability, CDIY has added about 600 basis points of profit improvement over the period of the integration. Record profitability has been driven through new product development, accessory growth, efficiency and enhancements in our SFS process and gains in emerging markets. Profitability has improved on both an organic and a -- with synergy numbers so in total, both numbers improving over the period of time. And then finally, the enabler of all these things, really around new product development and revenue synergies. Some key elements to note, DeWalt and Bostitch Hand Tools augmenting the strength of our Stanley Hand Tool business, has enabled share gains and in fact, over the course of the integration, the Hand Tool business had grown, which is the key deliverable for this organization. We've launched FatMax power tools to augment the strength that we have in the Black & Decker and DeWalt brands around the globe. That began in the first quarter of 2012 and will continue globally through the end of this year and beyond, but initially very good response. Emerging markets have been pervasive in their expansion, improving our Hand Tools business, our power tool business and our powerful accessory business concurrently. And then finally during the quarter, the latter part of Q2 we acquired Powers Fasteners. Powers Fasteners was found in 1921 and is a leader in code approvals globally. They play in a $3.8 billion market and roughly -- they're roughly a $140 million company with strength in the U.S. and Australia, New Zealand. This creates the only concrete tool, fastener and accessory portfolio within the U.S. fastener business. Powers also provides the opportunity to pull through such existing products as DeWalt hammers, accessories and pneumatics while at the same time, Stanley Black & Decker provide the opportunity to expand the Powers portfolio in the markets where we have established market position. Initial integration results are positive. Initial customer feedback is quite positive. So with that said, I'll turn the floor over to Jim to report out on the other segment.
James M. Loree: Thank you, Jeff, and kudos to your team under your leadership, which really did a remarkable job simultaneously integrating these businesses from Black & Decker and from Stanley, each of which when combined is -- this unit is larger than either of the 2 companies in totality before they were merged. So a $5 billion-plus business, a lot of moving parts global, a lot of issues to deal with on the NPI front and somehow, the execution in delivering this was just phenomenal and I think it's a credit to you. And I'm glad you're on the call to be able to describe that and answer some questions as we go forward here. Let's move on to Security. Security revenues were $792 million, up 613 -- or up 29% versus a year ago when they were $613 million. Segment profit was $122 million, up 15%. The profit rate was 18%, which was very impressive, excluding acquisitions, i.e., Niscayah in particular, and 15% including acquisitions. The 18% represents a 240 basis point sequential improvement and the 15.3% would be a 200 basis point sequential increase. The profit rate improvement was accomplished despite weakness in core markets and negative 4% organic growth. As you look at the organic growth, you can see that CSS was down 3%. They had a flattish U.S. performance. Europe was down mid-single digits not surprisingly, and that would be the legacy European piece of our business, which was primarily focused in France. And then the commercial MAS, which includes access and the SMS business or commercial mechanical security, was down 4%. Access continued to have issues with the CapEx requirements of its major customer, which were significantly decreased from a year ago. That will anniversary here shortly and not continue to be a problem, and then the SMS business had some issues with respect to a sluggish U.S. retrofit market, in particular health care, government and education, all those institutions facing budgetary issues, as well as a continuing gap in their product line, the MPP product line, which as the economic issues have continued over the past few years, the products in the market have -- the buying preferences have shifted more to an MPP product, the mid-price-point product, and we were a little bit slow to design an MPP and introduce an MPP line. The Tong Lung acquisition, which we initiated a tender offer earlier this year, is critical towards resolving this issue and we will close that, the majority of the shares, here in the next few weeks and then get right to work. We're already actually working on the MPP line for the commercial business through Tong Lung. And I will also say that Tong Lung Metal is the world's lowest-cost manufacturer of locks, of quality locks in the world. They have plants in Philippines and Taiwan, and this is a highly strategic acquisition and places a new advantage here for us in terms of cost competitiveness on subcomponents in the HPP line for commercial security and also fixes -- will help us fix this product gap, and obviously makes the HHI transaction more palatable too from a divestiture standpoint. Moving onto other security, that was also down about 5%. That included the residential business and also the health care. Resi was down in low-single digits as the market kind of slowed from the first quarter strength it had enjoyed. In health care, the Obamacare Supreme Court decision weighed heavily on CapEx decisions that were made by acute care and secondary care providers. So that was a very, very weak market in health care and so a little bit of an issue there. And then we also, you all know, acquired a company called AeroScout in the quarter which is a highly, highly strategic acquisition not only in Security, but throughout our portfolio and I'll talk about that in a minute. But they are the #1 player in the RTLS market in U.S. health care, actually global health care, RTLS being real-time locating systems for active RFID systems, which enable patient tracking, temperature sensing, asset tracking all on WiFi networks. And this capability will allow us to really provide a value proposition to our customers that goes beyond anything that we have seen before in our health care business, and I will talk more about that in a few minutes. Moving onto Industrial, our Industrial revenues were $635 million, up from $626 million a year ago, 1% increase. The organic growth was 1%. There were 4 points of negative currency offsetting 4 points of inorganic growth. Segment profit was $95 million, down nominally from $97 million a year ago. The profit rate was up 40 basis points, came in at 15.1%, but was in the normal historical range for Industrial despite a double-digit contraction in IAR Europe, where the contribution margins are near 50%. So you'll recall the last few quarters the Industrial business has been increasingly profitable in terms of rate. It was in the 18% range last quarter and so it's down from there, but it's almost all driven by cost absorption issues in the industrial and automotive repair European business, which as I said has very rich margins. The European business was down double digits for IAR. We had high-single-digit organic growth for our North American and mobile distribution business and a very strong OM performance as well. That's our code word for Mac Tools, by the way. And our Proto business was pressured and was negative in terms of organic growth by weak government sales, in particular the Industrial markets through the MRO held up reasonably well. And we'll talk again in a few minutes about the acquisition of AeroScout, which is going to enable our Industrial business to create a new business unit for advanced industrial solutions, which will take RFID and RTLS technology to our industrial customers through the IAR business. Engineered Fastening, John mentioned, had a great quarter, 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth despite a situation in Europe with an 11% decline in auto production in Europe, so a terrific job by those folks. Japan did benefit. We have a reasonably large business in Japan. It did benefit from the tsunami recovery production; that was helpful. But in general, these folks are making terrific progress on vehicle penetration and managing the business very tightly. So they were a real success story in the Industrial segment in the quarter. Hydraulics and CRC-Evans, which make up the Infrastructure business, in particular were actually were both pressured from a volume standpoint. CRC had organic revenues down 10%, all driven by actually more than a bigger decline in the North American onshore market, which we've discussed previously on calls, mainly due to the diminished U.S. pipeline market for gas and oil. And that is an ongoing saga, but they made great progress on the offshore business, offsetting a lot of that decline. So we're in a cyclical trough right now in North America onshore. Offshore is growing by leaps and bounds. I think when the onshore comes back and it will, this will be a big growth driver for us. So Industrial produced a respectable quarter under a most -- under mostly difficult market conditions. Now in the press release, we discussed a tactical change as it relates to acquisitions. And a few folks before the call mentioned, when they called in mentioned that they thought this was a strategic shift, and I will very clearly say that this is not a strategic shift. This is merely a tactical move to digest what we have acquired in the last few years and to take what we've acquired and to rev-up the organic growth engine, which is essentially another form integrating these acquisitions. And we just don't buy assets and let them sit in – kind of by themselves; we take them. When we buy them, we generally buy them because they strengthen our value propositions and sometimes it takes a little time and focus to make sure that we get that right and make the moves to drive organic growth. So what we've done over the last few years in terms of Black & Decker and Niscayah, GMT, CribMaster, AeroScout, Tom Lung and CRC-Evans and now Powers as well, all of these are going to provide a strong catalyst for organic growth and so over the next 12 to 18 months while we focus on organic growth, which I think is timely given the difficult markets in some of our businesses, we've got 5 major growth initiatives which we're pursuing which have collectively the capacity to drive 2 to 3 incremental points of organic growth over the next few years each year. So let's start with emerging markets. I think many companies are putting some focus on emerging markets. We've been doing that for a long time. I think the Black & Decker merger helped us drive scale in this area. We've gotten to the point now where the basic integrations are complete in the emerging markets. We're benefiting from that. But now we're going to rev it up a notch, and we're going to create new Asian-based dedicated SBUs for mid-price-point Hand Tools, power tools and commercial hardware products. Why is this important? Because about 70% of the market in emerging markets is in the MPP range. And in the past, most of the high-price-point power tool players and hand tool players have really come at it from taking those types of products and trying to modify them to some extent and then sell them into the MPP and HBP segments of the market and the emerging markets. That is a strategy that only has so much potential and in order to fully capture the opportunity, we feel that it's important that we create these Asian-based SBUs which are going to design and provide products to all our emerging markets around the world. And so this is a big sea change for us, and I think one that's going to lead to significant market share gain. Obviously there will be plants and production that follows as these -- as we continue to gain market share. The commercial hardware SBU will leverage the combined capability of GMT, which was that China-based commercial hardware acquisition that we made about 1.5 years ago and we will combine that with Tong Lung, Tong Lung's capability. And we will be able to design a full range of MPP products in the EN or in a European standard, and also design products that are cost competitive in the American standard. So we will have all the products that we need to drive share gain and commercial hardware around the world, leveraging our network. We will also make significant feet on the street additions in the emerging markets for local product management, local marketing and local sales teams. We obviously have some of that already, but we're talking about ramping up that resource significantly. Combined, all those activities should generate at least $300 million a year of additional revenue by year 3. Secondly, the smart tools and storage for IAR, this is the leveraging of CribMaster and the AeroScout technologies into the industrial markets, including areas such as MRP vending, FOD control, which is in foreign object damage, which is critical in aerospace, markets, electronic kanbans and client productivity monitoring. This technology that we have at CribMaster and AeroScout enables all of this. And just yesterday, we formed a new SBU under JoAnna Sohovich in IAR, which will take our capabilities here and form a sales force to take these products to market in a bigger and more aggressive way then we have in the past. Some of these capabilities are brand new for us. We've had great success already with CribMaster. Since the acquisition, we've just recently logged about $60 million in new business, about half of that in the U.S., half in Europe and this is all in the MRP vending. So we're well on our way towards achieving this $100 million goal by year 3. I think we should definitely exceed that as we go. Then there's offshore oil and gas pipeline services. This is about $0.5 billion market opportunity. We've made great progress here already. What we do now is we provide bundled solutions to spool-based owners for services such as staging the pipes, joining the pipes, welding them, coating them, inspecting them and loading them on the ship. We -- these spool bases today are operating at about 30% capacity. The expectation is over the next year or 2, that will increase to about 60% to 70%. We've already won the business, so now we just have to enjoy the growth there. And then we're -- right now we're working on a new concept, which is to provide these folks with automated portable spool bases, so that we can move them around the world as their needs change and as the new sources of energy are discovered. So this should easily be an incremental $100 million of growth potential by year 3. And then a final one are -- the final one, excluding Black & Decker, is the RTLS-enabled security. And this is simply taking the AeroScout RTLS capability and leveraging it into the Electronic Security market. The biggest thrust here will be into health care in the acute care facility vertical, and we're forming an internal sales JV between CSS and our health care business. We'll have about 30 to 40 reps covering C-level executives in these institutions and they will perform consultative assessments of safety, security, efficiency and compliance, and then they will offer the solutions to solve the problems that are discovered during those assessments. This concept plays right into the sweet spot of what these types of institutions need right now, which is to maximize their reimbursement and to achieve significant cost savings. And then finally, we have these Black & Decker revenue synergies that have been so successful so far. We've already driven about $250 million of benefit from that. We fully expect to deliver on our $300 million to $400 million external commitment and hopefully over the next year or 2, get to the high end of that range and perhaps drive beyond it. So as I said, these 5 initiatives, when taken in the aggregate, have the capacity to drive about 2 to 3 points of organic growth over the next few years, very exciting. And so taking the 12- to 18-month break from acquisitions to enable us to do this, I think, is probably a pretty good idea. Okay. Let's move to working capital. SFS continues to be a great value-creating story with a 1-turn improvement to 7.1 turns and with an 8% increase in total sales and a 15% reduction in working capital. We achieved on a year-over-year basis to a $1,445,000,000. And just to put it in perspective as a refresher, in second quarter of '09, our pro forma working capital was $2.1 billion and we were at 3.9 turns. In the post-merger period, we have eradicated $700 million of working capital and extracted that and put it to productive use. This has been a phenomenal value-creating story, and we're well on our way to achieving the legacy Stanley peak performance of 8.6 turns. We fully expect to get there sometime in 2013, and we expect further progress as the year goes on here. Now I'll turn it over to Don Allan to take you through some of the financial aspects.
Donald Allan: All right, thank you, Jim. On Page 13, as many of you read in the press release this morning, we talk quite a bit about the portfolio transformation and capital allocation. And before I get into the details on this page, I just want to remind everyone if you go back to our strategic framework that's been in place since 2004 time frame, the first tenet there is really about portfolio transformation. And as discussed, mixing it to higher growth and higher profitability businesses over the long term, as well as increasing our weighting in emerging markets and specifically having a goal of getting the 20% of the total company in emerging markets by the middle of this decade. The net result of that, as we drive towards the long term and as we grow, will be continued diversification away from U.S. home centers, i.e., as we grow in our growth platforms, that will become a smaller part of our company. So what we decided to announce and to give people an update on where we were in this -- our continued portfolio transformation and we are in the process of evaluating the potential divestment of our Hardware & Home Improvement business. And just as a reminder for those of you who may not be as familiar with that business, it's approximately $940 million in revenues. It operates largely under the brands Kwikset, Baldwin, Weiser, Stanley, National and Pfister brands. It's not a CDIY business, aside from the Pfister business. We do include the Pfister business in our CDIY segment. The remainder of the business that's included in our Security segment. 90% of the revenues are North American-based, and more than 50% of the revenue is through U.S. home centers. We think it's a very healthy business. It's had operating margin rate performance in the mid-to-high teens over the last few years. It has -- it is constrained in the North America primarily, as I mentioned, 90%. It does have long-term growth prospects, however, we do think we could potentially reallocate our capital into other areas that are higher growth in different industries, and it certainly has a very heavy weighted concentration in U.S. home centers. For those of you who asked the question why would you want to sell a business potentially that is at the bottom of the housing market today? Well, I'd just remind everybody is we do have a business, CDIY, that's over $5 billion in revenue, which has world-class brands, market-leading positions and that certainly provides us a quite significant potential upside to a housing recovery. As we've told many of you before, we think when you look at the peak revenues of that business in the past to where we are today, there's a potential of $1.5 billion of revenue upside in any type of housing recovery of significant magnitude. And that would assume getting back to a level of 2 million housing starts which maybe we'll never get back to that, but certainly there's a great deal of upside opportunity just in that business. If we make the decision to sell the HHI business, we do think that the after-tax proceeds will significantly exceed $1 billion. We're also in the process of evaluating a highly accretive and very strategic asset in our Engineered Fastening business. It's approximately $500 million in revenue. It's very synergistic with our current Engineered Fastening business. It's in favorable growth industries, so has that high growth attribute that we are looking for. very strong concentration in emerging markets, where the revenue is -- greater than 50% of revenue is in emerging markets. Like any particular asset that we evaluate for acquisition, we'll go through the process of evaluating whether it will achieve certain accretion profiles, as well as other return thresholds that we try to maintain through our entire acquisition process. And we will only proceed if we are able to achieve those aspects, but clearly a very compelling strategic asset that's under consideration for us. The other area that we're looking at capital allocation is potential doing a share repurchase in the future. Certainly looking at our current stock price yesterday closing below $60, it is a nice investment for us to consider as part of this capital allocation or reallocation strategy. So given all know that, there are a few -- 2 likely scenarios that I think could play out here. One, the potential sale of our HHI business and utilizing those proceeds to invest in this Engineered Fastening asset I described and on top of that, if there's excess cash available, utilize that to do share repurchase. The second likely scenario is that we sell the HHI business, but decide not to acquire the Engineered Fastening assets and utilize those proceeds to buy back stock after we do some modest deleveraging in that scenario, as we will lose approximately $200 million of EBITDA when we sell that business. Neither of those 2 scenarios result in any significant annualized EPS dilution, and it's very important that people recognize that. The third scenario, which I think is less likely, would be that we decide not to sell the HHI business. However, we do acquire the Engineered Fastening assets for the reasons that I articulated. Again, I think that scenario is less likely of the first 2, but it is something that we will consider in this process. The end result in any of those scenarios will be that we'll be taking 12 to 18 months off from business development aside from some small emerging markets activity, as Jim mentioned. And also as Jim mentioned that is not a strategic shift, it's simply a break in really looking at how we need to continue to integrate the acquisitions that we've done and Jim really walked through the details of where we're focused in that effort, primarily on organic growth. So moving to Page 14 and I'll look at guidance over here. So we've lowered our guidance to $5.40 to $5.65 from the previous guidance range of $5.75 to $6. Let me walk you through with some of the assumptions associated with that. We are reiterating our organic net sales guidance for the year. We do think the pro forma net sales will continue to be 1% to 2% year-over-year, so that includes the effect of Niscayah full year for 2011 numbers when I say pro forma. And when we look at regionally, we think the performance will still be consistent with North America up 1%; Europe down 3% and emerging markets between 10% to 15%. You can see year-to-date, North America and emerging markets are pretty in line with that assumption. Europe is a little different. Europe is not quite as bad as that 3% as John and Jim have both articulated previously in the call. We do expect that things will likely continue to deteriorate in Europe, so we're sticking with that negative 3% in that region of the world for the year. We expect the BDK cost synergies to be $115 million this year and $45 million for Niscayah, so no change there. And in the cost reduction actions, which were really targeted at discretionary spend back in the first quarter of $150 million, that's in place and we anticipate that, that will be achieved. Our share count will be roughly 167 million. We believe our free cash flow will be $1.2 billion, so no change with that. It does assume an increase for benefits from working capital. Jim talked about where we stood to 6 months at 7.1 turns, so progressing very nicely in that area. And just a reminder for those of you who may not be as familiar with our company, there is a great deal of seasonality associated with free cash flow. And if you look at our history of the 2 combined companies, the first half history as a percentage of the full year tends to represent anywhere from 21% to 24% of the total year. And if you look at our $300 million performance through the first half, that clearly would indicate a path to $1.2 billion performance for the year. What we're changing to the right of the page or updating associated with our guidance, is we continue to see incremental headwinds from foreign exchange, an additional $55 million impact to our operating margin. And then you can see in the interest and other line, we have an additional $20 million negative impact as well, that $75 million of incremental negative associated with foreign exchange or $0.35. If you look at the currencies associated with that, and I'll just take people back to our January earnings call. I walked through a fair amount of detail around foreign exchange. And there's really 3 currencies, as John touched on at the beginning, that have a significant impact on our business. They represent about 3/4 of our international exposure. That's the euro, Brazilian real and Canadian dollar. So back in January, I pointed out that going into the year, we thought FX would be a negative of $0.45, and it's really being driven by the fact that the euro have been down 7% going into the year, the Brazilian real down 11% and the Canadian dollar down 3%. What has happened since then? Well, I think we all know that they continued to deteriorate. And as of the end of the second quarter, the euro was down an additional 5.5% from that $1.29 rate it was at, at the end of last year, down to close to the $1.22 now. The Brazilian real, which was down about $0.535 at the end of last year going into this year is now down to $0.48 at the end of the second quarter, so down 10%, an additional 10%. And the Canadian dollar, $0.98 at the beginning of the year, now down to $0.965 at the end of the second quarter, close to 2% decline. So you can see we've seen significant declines very similar to declines as we went into the beginning of this year, which is contributing to another $0.35 negative drain on our EPS performance. That's a total of $0.80 year-over-year negative due to foreign exchange. Hopefully that's helpful, providing that level of information. The other area that we're seeing a negative against earnings is a negative mix impact is although our total revenues are not changing for guidance, we are seeing a shift to our CDIY businesses performing very nicely, as you've heard. But we're seeing pressures in our Industrial and Security segments that Jim articulated on. That is causing a $50 million negative on the year for our performance this year. Embedded in there is a slight improvement in commodity inflation, so we are seeing modest improvements in that area but that is embedded in the $50 million negative. What we decided to do is we want to quickly take action, as we tend to do with the management team, is really focus on what we can do to offset some of those market, economic and operational pressures. So we decided to take an incremental $50 million of cost actions in the second half of 2012, largely headcount-related actions. That's $100 million of annualized cost takeout. So clearly, there's a carryover effect in 2013. That's really to try to offset the impact of this negative mix that I just described. We also had a few -- 2 acquisitions in the second quarter, as has been discussed previously, with Powers Fasteners and AeroScout. We don't expect that to have an impact on 2012. However, as we move into 2013, we do think that will have an accretive impact of approximately $0.10 in EPS. So as we begin to integrate and drive on some of those synergies that were discussed, we'll start to see that positive accretive impact on that investment we made. One last housekeeping item. The tax rate is still expected to be between 22% and 23% for the year. However, we will see a little bit of volatility between the third quarter and the fourth quarter, with the third quarter likely being mid- to high-20s and the fourth quarter being below 20% due to some timing of certain tax contingencies. So the takeaway from this is that we clearly had a significant negative mix offset. Our volumes are consistent overall for the company. We're taking incremental cost actions to offset that mix impact, and we have lowered our guidance due to the foreign exchange pressure only. So a little more in-depth discussion here on Page 15 associated with the 3 segments. We continue to drive margin rate expansion across the vast majority of our businesses in 2012 as well as the whole company. We're being very proactive about cost containment and driving successful integration in a lower organic growth environment today. For CDIY, we believe this will be a mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for 2012. We have not assumed any large housing rebounds. We do expect market share gains to continue the rollout of new products, the execution of revenue synergies really to drive this growth. We anticipate the operating margin rate to expand above 2Q '12 level in the second half due to favorable price inflation, trending based on current commodity costs, cost synergies that we continue to execute on, the cost actions I just described, as well as continued volume leverage. In the Security segment based on the performance through the first half and some of the pressures they are experiencing that Jim described, we expect low-single-digit organic revenue declines for the entire year 2012. Despite this revenue drag on segment margins due to lower volumes, as well as Niscayah continuing to be integrated, the execution of the cost synergies and the cost containment actions that we've taken on this year as well as we've just started to implement for the back half of the year, will still result in a flat OM rate performance year-over-year, which will be quite an achievement given some of the volume pressures. In the Industrial side, we do expect to see low-single-digit organic revenue growth for the entire year, so nice performance in Q1, up high-single digits, difficult revenue performance in the first quarter, but still had some -- in the second quarter, but we still had some growth. So we expect modest growth in the back half. The operating margin rate will likely expand in a modest player -- moderate way versus the 2011 level, as we continue to take cost actions to mitigate the volume pressures that we've experienced in Q2 and expect in the back half of the year. We do think there will be nice growth in the Engineered Fastening business, and the revenue lines really moderate some of the pressures we're seeing in the Industrial & Automotive Repair sector, as well as that onshore pipeline market that's affecting CRC that Jim touched on. So to summarize the call this morning, we believe we have a very strong track record of navigating through challenging macroeconomic times. We're very focused on what we need to do and how to continue to move forward with our earnings, cash flow and our portfolio transformation. The negative mix offset -- the negative mix I described is being offset by incremental cost actions but yet, the FX pressure will result in lower annual guidance. So the $0.35 of incremental FX pressure is the primary driver of reducing our annual guidance. Niscayah and the Black & Decker integrations continue to be very successful. John touched on the incremental $50 million of cost synergies related to Black & Decker that will occur in 2013. So we continue to be encouraged with the net impact and result of that. We're very pleased to announce the 20% dividend increase, as we continue to return capital to our shareholders, which has been our track record over the last decade and beyond. We also have put in place a 20 million share repurchase authorization to be able to respond to the potential outcomes I described around capital reallocation. Outside of the HHI-related activity, as both Jim and I have mentioned, we will curtail major bolt-on acquisition activity for only 12 to 18 months, and focus on some smaller emerging market acquisition activity, as well as focus on key organic growth initiatives of $500 million to $600 million of revenue over the next 3 years. The Stanley Fulfillment System is really continuing to drive improvement over year -- year-over-year, and you can see with working capital up 16% -- working capital turns up 16%, 7.1 turns. The net result is a $1.2 billion free cash flow forecast for this year, which would be a 20% increase from 2011. We continue to try to be agile, proactive around our cost containment and focus on our organic growth opportunities, given a tough macroeconomic environment. So that concludes the presentation portion of the call.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Sandra, why don't we turn it to Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Research: To get to the relatively flat Security margins for fiscal year '12 implies a large ramp-up in the second half. Can you talk about the timing of specific actions that are hitting in terms of what's driving that expansion [ph] on the weaker organic growth in the segment?
Donald Allan: Yes, I think it's really 2 things that are occurring there. Of course, the continued execution of the Niscayah integration as we see more synergies occurring in the back half of the year and as we go into 2013, as well as the very proactive cost actions they've taken at the beginning of this year, as well as the most recent ones we're looking at were $100 million of annualized program across the whole company. Certainly, Security will have a significant portion of that. And I guess the last thing I would mention is that they've been very proactive around passing on price to the customers where appropriate, given certain inflationary pressures that have kind of occurred in the past. We would expect those price increases to stay in place and be able to drive improved margins in the back half.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Research: Okay. And within that segment, can you help us understand how that 6% order growth that you reported last quarter impacted 2Q? So were there customer delays in terms of those orders coming -- turning into sales? Or was there just a substantial weakening in orders in this current quarter?
Donald Allan: Yes, I think the dynamic that's happening there, you're primarily referring to our CSS, the Convergent Security Solutions business, where we did have backlog growing in the last quarter. And clearly, this particular industry is feeling a little bit of pressure around subcontract resources in that space. The subcontractors that are used in this space are used for not only our business, but they're used by the cable companies, the telephone companies, et cetera. And so there is a bit of a resource strain right now in that space that's causing a little bit of drag, and then you combine that with some of the restrictions we're experiencing in the government channels as well. It's putting a fair amount of pressure on both order trend and what I would say conversion of orders into revenue.
James M. Loree: Yes, and this is Jim. The last few years, I think we've been pretty good at getting the orders in CSS and not as good at converting the backlog in a timely fashion. And I think part of that underlies the leadership change that we made in CSS North America, where we now have somebody in place who is a more generalist type of a leader, who's got the operations capabilities and focus as well as the sales and marketing.
Operator: And the next question is from Jason Feldman from UBS.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: On M&A, you described this pause as a tactical change, and I'm sorry I didn't mean to mischaracterize it. But I guess I'm just kind of curious as to why you think this is the right time. I understand that you need to focus on integrating what you have, but you seem to have strong confidence in your cash flow. You're possibly selling HHI with sales that are rather depressed, and valuations on multiples and potential acquisitions look relatively attractive where they're available. So isn't this actually the time where you'd almost want to do the opposite for now and then come back to the integration and organic growth initiatives going forward sometime in the future?
John F. Lundgren: Yes, Jason, your observation is very logical, but what you're leaving out or missing that I think will be helpful for you and everyone else is we look at 3 things all of equal proportion as we evaluate acquisitions. This hasn't changed since 2004. Specifically and you're well-aware, we look at strategy, the strategic fit. Does it fit with our growth platforms as Jim very articulately described them? Is it high-growth? Is it where we can compete? Is it where we can have global-class leadership? Is it where our brands matter? That's the first screen. The second screen is the financial hurdle. Does it significantly achieve our cost of capital? We might discriminate in favor of an acquisition where we could use overseas cash because obviously, it's earning such a low return. But simply said, if it's a small bolt-on, it has to get to our financial hurdles, 15% operating margin, 15% ROCE quicker than a large one. But that's the second, if you will, filter. The third is organizational capacity, and I think maybe that's the one that you're leaving out in your observation. Specifically, we are as likely to walk away from a deal or not pursue a deal because we don't think we have the corporate or business-specific capacity to aggressively integrate it, manage it. Two things: a, what comes with the acquisition in terms of management; and b, to the extent management -- we are as comfortable with the management that comes with the acquisition, what exists in-house within our various businesses to give us the confidence we can successfully integrate. If you just look very quickly within our segments, our CDIY team is incredibly capable. That being said they've, for 2.5 years, been integrating Black & Decker. That's been 75% of the activity that's been within CDIY. We've just added Powers, which as Jeff described is strategic. It's going well. Their plate is very full. Within Security, we bought Niscayah. We closed on that deal less than 9 months ago. A lot of it's in Europe. Niscayah didn't come with as much operating management as we'd anticipated and as a consequence, we've redeployed some of our more capable executives to oversee that business. It's going very well, but Brett Bontrager and his very capable team also have a very, very full plate. That leaves the Industrial platform where some of the opportunities are smaller. One of our more capable tested proven teams with arguably the organizational capacity is Industrial in general and our Engineered Fastening team in particular, which is why Don referenced and Jim did that we're looking at something in that space. So when you cut through it all, the organizational capacity issue, digesting what we have, be sure -- making sure that we've properly integrated them, set a solid foundation and teaming them up for strong organic growth is every bit is important as the other 2, I'll say, filters that you, I think, appropriately pointed out.
James M. Loree: And I will just add to that, that we always look at one other thing, which is our capital allocation strategy over the long term, which has been to take about 2/3 of our capital, excess capital and allocate it to acquisitions and the 1/3 to return to the shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And we tend to favor share repurchases at moments when we think the stock is grossly undervalued. And it's difficult for us to look at Stanley Black & Decker as world-class -- series of franchises trading at 6x EBITDA and then go buy some small private company for a couple hundred million dollars at 9 or 10x EBITDA, and justify why we would have want to do that in our heads. So we're going to work on organic growth, digesting some of these acquisitions for all the reasons John said. And we're going to take the excess cash for that period of time, and we're going to maintain our credit worthiness. And whatever is left over, we're going to buy back our own shares until we get to a point where the arbitrage is more -- is closer and makes more sense.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then just lastly, but in terms of the repurchases, the way that I thought I heard Don describe it, the new repurchase authorization seems to be largely a potential redeployment of the HHI proceeds assuming that, that deal happens. So Jim, did you just suggest that basically the 2/3 that normally is used for M&A or free cash flow is also on the table for potential repurchases?
John F. Lundgren: Historically, Jason, the allocation is 2/3. But historically in the last 5 years, it has been close to 50-50 between buyback and dividend. 45% to 55% of our cash has been returned to shareholders the last 5 years despite the, if you will, ideal allocation over time that Jim described as basically 2/3, 1/3.
James M. Loree: And what that enables, if you think back to the long-term financial objectives that we've had in place since 2004 is that we'd like to grow our revenue organically about 3% to 4% a year. And then we'd like to grow our total revenue somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 12%. We've far exceeded the total growth rate over the last decade, growing closer probably around 20%. However, that was aided by that one very large acquisition or merger, Black & Decker. I think if you take that away, probably closer to right around the stated goal that we had. So that particular -- there's no real magic to that other than the fact that our capital allocation between 50% and 2/3 of our excess cash flow with the prices we that typically pay for acquisitions enables us to achieve that math. And that math, when we grow the top line 10% to 12% a year, our goal is to grow, to expand margins at the same time and to achieve mid-teens earnings growth. And we have definitely achieved that over the last decade, and that's where we're going to continue to do over the long term. This is -- that's why we use the word tactic to describe this because we do occasionally have a tactical change here where the organizational capacity becomes an issue or the arbitrage, the valuations become an issue or an opportunity, to characterize it more positively. And under those circumstances, we typically will shift to a more repurchase kind of focus for a period of time. That served us very well. In the early part of the last decade, we bought back several hundred million -- probably close to $600 million worth of shares in the 20s. A couple of years ago, we bought back another similar amount in the 40s. And so I think we have a pretty good sense to -- as to when the stock is grossly undervalued, and I feel like we're in a -- that kind of a mode right now. So this makes perfect sense, especially given our organizational capacity constraints at the same time.
John F. Lundgren: Jason, one final point because you've asked your follow-up and you'll get cut-off. As it relates to buybacks, also keep in mind where that cash is. As most U.S. multinationals, the majority of our cash is generated overseas. Buybacks with overseas cash obviously are not terribly tax efficient. So our desire to do that, to do more is somewhat constrained by where our cash sits. That being said, there are ways to work with that, work through that, work around that. And Jim's point is a really important one. We think the best investment out there is SWK at $60. So the hurdle for an acquisition is higher than it's ever been.
Operator: The next question is from Dan Oppenheim from Crédit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was wondering if can you talk a bit more in terms of the HHI and fastening and potential transactions there. You've been talking about the stock. It seems you're very aware of the valuation there in thinking about the repurchase. On HHI, it seems pretty clear in terms of just what you'd like to do with that. I'm wondering if that's a thought that you're being potentially being paid for the entity growth and that as the business rebounds here in housing? Or if it's more of a strategic issue in terms of wanting to – let's just say divest at this end?
James M. Loree: Yes, I'll take it. The reason now we feel is a good time to divest HHI is because as Don said earlier, HHI has reasonable growth prospects in the next couple of years ahead of it in the U.S., and that's largely because we're out of stage in this cycle where we expect some sort of a housing recovery. And so do the potential buyers of this asset, and that makes it attractive to them. From our perspective we, using a slightly longer-term strategic lens, look at it and say, "That would be great to ride that. We'll get paid for a good part of that. It's a relatively tax-efficient transaction by the way." And our stock is -- to the extent we use the proceeds for repurchase, our stock is undervalued as we've talked about. So that all makes sense to us. But over the medium term, the strategic attractiveness of that business is okay. In terms of growth, as Don pointed out, but it would take an enormous effort too and a lot of capital to invest in international and emerging market capabilities, very North American centric. So there's a short term ride ahead in North America to position that business for the long term, the amount of effort that will be required, the amount of capital starts to put it in a position where the other opportunities for faster growth with opportunities with more margin expansion potential with locations in the emerging markets, in particular, emphasis in the emerging markets. There are other opportunities that are on our growth platforms that are much more attractive to us. So the timing is absolutely perfect for us to divest the asset because it will command a very good price. We're pretty confident in that. And if it doesn't, by the way, we won't sell it. So I think that's a very logical time to do it and hence the decision.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then secondly, I'm just wondering, I think, John, you've been pretty clear in terms of the thoughts and growth in emerging markets, particularly in Asia assets growing to global diversified industrial company. I think -- would you think you're talking about ramping the local teams? Or do you think that you have enough in terms of critical mass in place? Or how much should we expect to see in terms of just very small acquisitions in terms of bolstering your prices there?
John F. Lundgren: Two things. Most of it is going to organic, and Jim touched on this when he described the formation of the new focused SBUs to drive organic growth in emerging markets. I'll address both your questions. Most of those are internal resources, but that was one of the luxuries of the Stanley Black & Decker merger where each company outside has a desire, but honestly not the commitment in terms of management feet on the street, et cetera. We were both rather -- spread rather thinly, to be very candid. And while a lot of people came out of the confined organizations, we've talked about this before, so I won't repeat it, no one came out of emerging markets. We had the chance to take 2 capable senior executives, divide their responsibility, take the 2 teams, merge them in an effective way, and this is just the next step in that evolution. We've made one small acquisition to the second part of your point in the Mechanical Security area. That being said, small or large acquisitions in emerging markets, particularly, Asia, less so in Latin America, are very, very difficult and time-consuming to exercise. The integrity of the financial statements, business practices, a lot of other things where I think maybe rule of thumb is, let's say in Western Europe or more appropriately North American markets, of 4 things we look at, we might pursue 2 and acquire 1. In Asia, of 9 things we look at or 10 things we look at, we might pursue 2 and maybe acquire 1 just because it's a difficult legal environment. It's a difficult environment to confirm the integrity of the financials relative to the price expectations. It takes longer. Taxes are complex and as a consequence, I'm going to say no to small bolt-ons, but what we're saying is they're hard to execute. They're very time-consuming, so that will not be the driver.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: [Operator Instructions]
Operator: The next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes, I just wanted to drill in a little bit deeper on the Security margins going forward. You've talked about an outlook for margins to be relatively flat. I just want to make sure we understand what basis that's on. Is that excluding acquisitions? Or is that sort of an all-in figure? And then if at the same time, if you could give us some sense of if you divest the HHI, knowing that that's not a definite yet but if you were to, can you get give us some understanding of what the margins look like last year, excluding that business in Security?
Donald Allan: Yes, Stephen, I would say that your first part of your question is that's -- it is including Niscayah. So the operating margin rate that we're referring to would include the effect of Niscayah, so it's not excluding acquisitions. And it's for the reasons I articulated, I think the first question we had today, which is really due to the 3 areas -- the 4 areas because Jim added on, which is due to the cost actions that we've taken and that we will be taking in the second half. It's really continued execution on the synergies of Niscayah and the benefits we will see in the second half, the positive pricing trends that we've seen versus previous years' commodity and other inflationary experience. And then Jim talked about improved execution levels as well in the business and how we can convert backlog more rapidly and more efficiently to revenue. As far as the impact of HHI on this segment, not a dramatic impact. It's not dramatically off from current line averages.
Operator: The next question is from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Of the $150 million benefit that you guys had initially, which is now rising, can you talk about how much fell in 2Q and in 1Q, as well as the inflation headwind at $0.70? Can you talk about how that might have shifted, given the macro changes?
Donald Allan: Yes. I would say that the $150 million was executed in the first quarter of this year. We're now talking about another $50 million that we'll execute here in the month of July, by the end of the month, early August time frame. And the vast majority of that was -- $150 million was completed in the first quarter. So you'd see a full effect of that in Q2, $150 million divided by 4. So there's no reason why you wouldn't see that. And then as I mentioned, the new actions will be $50 million in the back half. As far as inflation, as I touched on the $50 million of negative mix impact around lower Security and Industrial volumes versus higher CDIY volumes in our original guidance, embedded in there is a slight benefit to improved inflation outlook. So we clearly are seeing a little bit of deflation in certain commodities. Although we won't experience a dramatic impact of that in 2012, it's just due to the timing of really getting some of those price increases or decreases in place with our vendors and getting it through the inventory and the production of finished goods, et cetera, before it actually is sold to our customers and see that benefit. I will remind everybody that we did experience significant levels of inflation. So even though we are experiencing a little bit of deflation expected this year going into next year, we still have not fully recovered that inflation that we experienced in that time frame back in '11 and '10.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
William Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Hi, this is actually Will Wong, on for Mike. Can you guys talk about the current pricing environment you're seeing, especially within CDIY? I know, Don, you mentioned inflation historically has been offset by price by roughly -- or roughly 85% of that has been offset by price? Does that continue to be a reasonable assumption?
Donald Allan: Well, I would say that -- what we said historically is that our -- we believe our company can offset -- Stanley legacy has offset 85% of inflation with the price. Our new company, since the merger, we're trying to achieve those levels of objectives. But we've also indicated that in CDIY, that percentage is much less and it's higher and much closer to 100% in our Industrial and Security businesses or pieces of our Industrial and Security businesses. So in CDIY, and I think if we achieve anywhere from 40% to 50% price inflation recovery through an inflationary period, we've done well based on the current makeup of that business in the product line.
Operator: And the next question is from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.
Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: On the timing of the potential deals, the sale of HHI, is that predicated on doing anything with the Engineered Fastening business? Or one -- does that have to lead the potential acquisition? Or could you do Engineered Fastening ahead of time, you feel comfortable doing that before an HHI sale?
James M. Loree: These transactions are not interdependent, so any one transaction can occur without the other. We have the liquidity to do it, and we have the financial capacity to do it. So it really -- we could end up with an engineered -- as Don pointed out, we could end up with an Engineered Fastening acquisition and not a sale of HHI, and we'd be perfectly okay with that.
Operator: The next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley.
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I was hoping to just dig in a little bit to the guidance change. So it looks like you guys are chalking up most of the $0.35 to FX. And if I do the math between the $1.29 that you originally guided at and the $1.22 today, I think you guys have said in the past that the $0.01 impact of the euro rate typically results in a $0.015 EPS impact, so that's giving you more like a $0.10 delta. So can you explain what I'm missing?
John F. Lundgren: Yes, 30% of our business is in Europe, Nicole. We actually do business in other foreign countries, but Don will give you the math on that.
Donald Allan: Yes. That's just the proportion of it Nicole. And then we gave that rule of thumb for the euro because it is a dominant component of our FX. But as I touched on in the call and I also touched on in our January earnings call, there's 3 major currencies that drive a big impact to our performance as a company. Clearly the euro is 1, the Brazilian real is #2 and the Canadian dollar is #3. That is about 3/4 of our international OM exposure around the world. So you have to look at all 3 of those currencies to really get it through assessment. And if you look at how I described it earlier where we've seen -- at the beginning of the year, we saw about a 7% decline in the euro, 11% in the Brazilian real, 3% in the Canadian dollar and then incremental to that since the beginning of the year, we've experienced about 5.5% decline in the euro to the dollar. The Brazilian real has declined another 10% beyond that 11%, and then the Canadian dollar has declined another roughly 2% since then. And so as I mentioned, the first wave of that was about a $0.45 impact back in January, and the second wave is now a $0.35 incremental impact on top of that. And that's really the best way to look at it. I think the rule of thumb is great for just looking at the euro, but you also have to look at these other currencies.
John F. Lundgren: Particularly when in emerging market -- Latin America, there's as much volatility as there has been of late. Remember, we have a $750 million to $800 million business in Latin America. 2/3 of that's in Brazil, and Don talked about the real. So that's -- in your top line math, Nicole, that's a big, big piece that's excluded.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Wherley from Janney Capital Markets.
Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to ask about Industrial. It looks like you're factoring in 16%-plus margins in the second half. Does that include European IAR getting worse, since you said you expect overall Europe to deteriorate further in the second half?
Donald Allan: I wouldn't say it's going to get dramatically worse from an OM rate perspective in IAR. I think you also have to recognize the proactive cost actions that we're trying to take across the company. Clearly, a business like IAR is suffering from economic circumstances. It's going to be contributing to that extra size in a significant way. So I wouldn't say that it's going to drop off dramatically from where it was. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if it's roughly continued at the same level we experienced like in Q2 or in some cases, maybe even slightly better.
Operator: And the next question is from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I understand the financial rationale behind potentially selling HHI. I'm trying to fully understand the strategic rationale, however, based on 2 things. First off, if you no longer have HHI, your European exposure by definition goes up company-wide. And it also -- I always understood one of the benefits of having the HHI business is it's a -- the lockset business is a very high-margin category for the retailers and therefore, you're able to leverage those SKUs into getting more power tool listings at the home centers, and so not having HHI may affect your market share.
John F. Lundgren: I'll do it. Yes, Sam, the Europe -- this is John and then I'm going to turn it over to Jeff, because you won't get a follow-up. That's after we pick Jeff up off the floor with his reaction to we have leverage in power tools because of lockset margins. Jeff's the expert, and we'll let him talk about it. Totally different departments, buyers and everything else. But to Europe, yes, it's math. To your point, if we sell $900 million worth of business that's overwhelmingly in the U.S. and do nothing else, the math will be a higher percentage not in absolute terms, but a higher percentage of the total will be in Europe. Over time, we'll shift away from that. We're not going out of business in Europe. But yes, the math is irrefutable. Jeff, why don't you talk about the leverage you get from the power tools from the lockset business? Or the -- more importantly, the lack thereof and exactly how that works in the home centers because you're the -- you're the homes expert.
Jeffery D. Ansell: Thanks, John. Sam, I think, you could draw conclusion you just did reasonably. The fact of the matter, however, is that every one of these programs stands alone. And if you look at our size even as the world leader and market leader as compared to the size of the customers that supports the HHI business, you'd say the leverage is that -- is certainly a challenge at least. Beyond that, the chain is as strong as its weakest link. So when you have an issue in any one part of your business, it becomes an issue. When you have a benefit, it doesn't necessary translate to a greater benefit. All those things stand alone. So there really has been no benefit to speak of in any way of the HHI business on the power tool business or vice versa. All those programs across various customers, departments, regions, et cetera, stand alone. So there wouldn't be any impact that I could see...
John F. Lundgren: Totally different buyers, Jeff, totally different departments, different merchandising decisions, Sam. We talked about that a lot, and we wished it were the case of putting Stanley and putting Black & Decker together because 2 large such suppliers to the home centers. But at the end of the day we, as a corporation, are about 1.5% of the large retail -- of one of the large home centers' revenue. And so dice and slice that, it's even a smaller piece. So it's logical but in fact in reality, it's just simply lower nowhere -- not the case.
Jeffery D. Ansell: And if you look at the lockset business, everything that we do in the home centers, it is the least differentiated. So it relies most heavily on its cost, its brand appeal and its cost position. The -- and therefore, it's so much susceptible to private-label incursions over time. The -- one of the rationales behind the Tong Lung acquisition was it gets you the world -- it gets us the world's best-cost manufacturing, and provides an opportunity for the buyer of this business to participate in any private label business that might end up shifting from the branded business. But for us, we're just not interested in doing a lot of private label business. So that's just another reason it's strategically less attractive to us than some of the other things that we do in CDIY.
Operator: And the next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Just to take advantage of Jeff a little bit more here. Jeff, can you talk about just domestically as it relates to the CDIY business? You talked a lot about market share. Can you talk about what prices are doing on an apples-to-apples basis maybe year-over-year? How you see the promotional environment today and how that impacts how you go-to-market? And then any quantification you can put behind the market share as you see it would be helpful?
Jeffery D. Ansell: Dennis, the environment is not so different than it was over the last 12 months. Growth is at a premium. Competitors and retailers alike, very aggressive. That said, I think our biggest benefit has been far better execution in planning promotionally. And so if you look at what we've attempted to do inside the year, we have moved a lot of things from one period to another, products from one to another. And the desire is to make sure that we provide the greatest value to the end user, to the greatest POS benefit of the retailer for our customers and the greatest share gain opportunity for us. And we've moved a lot of things as a consequence. The shortcut to thinking is we've done it before and therefore, we need to comp it exactly the way we've done it previously. We've really abolished that way of thinking and revised our promotional plans in the space. What you've seen us do is promote older legacy products more aggressively to make sure we hold that position while we enable the growth of lithium-ion products to flow through, so that's been quite positive. And I would say all in all, most recent periods you'll see that Father's Day, the best example promotionally, big season for every domestic retail customer. Our business was up great during that Father's Day period than our POS average year-to-date. Therefore promotionally, we've been successful and you can see we're both successful and profitable in those endeavors.
Operator: And the next question is from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: Good call, by the way, on the tactical plan. I like that. I wanted to ask Jeff a question on the CDIY. Demand patterns within the quarter, can you just comment on that please?
Jeffery D. Ansell: Demand was consistent throughout the quarter. We started relatively good position in April and carried through the subsequent 2 months. POS consistent, relatively consistent across the periods, taking into effect the seasonal nature of June and Father's Day. Really, nothing extraordinary in either direction, pretty consistently positive performance across the quarter.
Operator: And the next question is from Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Seems to be an underlying theme of MPP or focus on it. Can you talk about any sort of cannibalization impact from that and maybe the margin implication of mix moves toward more MPP broadly?
James M. Loree: Sure. This is Jim. I'd say when we talk about MPP in the domestic markets, well let's start with that or the developed markets. Definitely, some shifting going on in both power tools and hand tools and commercial hardware. However, I think in power tools, we are very well-situated with our Tradesman line and with our revived Black & Decker line, which I think is outstanding to deal with any cannibalization, and it's not debilitating cannibalization. In any case, it goes from somewhat lower margin to higher margin business and maybe for a slightly lower purchase price. So I think in the CDIY business, we don't really have a big issue there. We clearly do have an issue in the commercial mechanical security business, as I've discussed previously. That issue is -- in our case, we're getting cannibalized by the competition right now. So we've lost some share. So there's no internal cannibalization associated with us developing an MPP line. It's an absolute essential must-do for us. In addition to that, we need to get more aggressive in the contract construction -- commercial construction market as well. We historically have been much more of a retrofit business, selling our products into the institutions such as education, health care and government that have multiple locations and require locks that can be converted and changed over time and replaced. So we're definitely doing something to address that with Tong Lung in what I described earlier. And then we move to the developing markets. And I think in that area, there's absolutely no cannibalization whatsoever. That is -- it's an opportunity, huge opportunity for us, but it's a markets that we don't serve. It's generally served by local competition. We do see Boschs and Makitas starting to kind of poke around in there and start to try to figure out how to develop positions as well. So I think we're all going to be involved in a land grab in that particular area in power tools, Hand Tools. I think we'll have a better shot at Hand Tools, obviously in terms of accelerated market share gain because the competition will be weaker. And then in commercial security, again there's a -- it's pretty wide open space, a lot of local competition, no cannibalization.
Operator: And the next question is from Cliff Ransom from Ransom Research.
Clifford Ransom - Ransom Research, Inc.: First of all, thank you very much for your detail, very useful and in particular, I appreciate your comment on the management depth as a factor in the acquisition lull. I think the answer -- I'm going to ask 2 questions, but -- because I think the answer to the first one is no and the second one is more important. Is there anything you can say about Apex Tools? And number two, when I look at the portfolio, the one really big hole is that 4% in Asia. Can you talk about what you're going to do there please?
John F. Lundgren: Yes, the answer to the first question's no. And the answer to the second question is yes, we would -- we have a -- it depends on how you define Asia as well, obviously Asia as a geography, but we talk about the non-developed Asia Pacific markets. I think Jim has been fairly articulate on this on the last call and the portfolio transition. But simply said, our business has grown in emerging markets in total, but that would include Latin America and emerging Asian markets from 10% or 11% at the time of the merger to 14% now. We still feel that we are woefully underdeveloped in emerging markets. We think 20% is the target. We've actually publicly stated that. I think you're aware of that. And it wouldn't hurt us, I think, to grow to 25%. That's the driver behind the formation of the SBUs that Jim talked about at length on that one slide. And as we think about Jeff Ansell's business, our IAR business and to some extent our Security business, particularly Mechanical Security, that's what's driving all these initiatives. But in response to an earlier question, because acquisitions are much harder in Asia, they're a little easier in Latin America, we believe we're going to have to do it organically. And I think Jim did a real nice job articulating that we are going to get serious about it. We're going to do it with internal resources. We're going to sell, fund them with some of the cost cuts. And you're absolutely right, we recognize the void. We're addressing it, but more with our resources and via acquisition.
James M. Loree: And I have -- also, when you look at the logic of the Engineered Fastening acquisition, it's about $200 million of revenue in Asia, so very nice -- that would be a very nice incremental pop for our -- what we're trying to accomplish there as well. The company's actually headquartered in Asia.
John F. Lundgren: Singapore.
James M. Loree: So that's a -- that would be nice and again, another one of the reasons behind the decision on capital -- reallocating capital.
Operator: And the next question is from Mike Kim from Imperial Capital.
Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Just turning back to Niscayah. Could you talk a little bit about the pipeline you're seeing there and the overall market environment in Europe? Does that sort of suggest maybe a little more headwind relative to what we saw in the first half?
Donald Allan: Yes, as we mentioned, the performance in Q2 with Niscayah overall was about 5% pro forma revenue decline. And we continue to see pressures in our European business. As we went into the year, we felt that we really have baked in 7% of an organic revenue decline for Niscayah associated with the accretion from that acquisition in 2012. We still see that that's a likely possibility. We've also indicated that if it got as bad as 10% for the year, we'd be able to offset that with additional synergies and still achieve our accretion objective. We don't see anything that changes that outlook at this point, and we're prepared for a more difficult second half which in the Security, Electronic Security business, you would tend to see an economic impact and a little further down the road because these are longer term, longer lead types of revenue objectives or projects. And you don't necessarily see that as quickly as you would in the CDIY or in Industrial business. So it's taking a little longer to see that impact.
Operator: And the last question is from Greg Hensler [ph] from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Unknown Analyst: So if you guys are successful in selling the HHI business, but you cannot acquire the Engineered Fastening business, can you talk about exactly how you plan to delever? And also do you have a particular credit rating target where you -- if you're looking to delever too soon, you can hold on to a certain rating? How are you guys looking at that?
Donald Allan: Yes, if that scenario played out where we decided to sell HHI and not acquire the Engineered Fastening asset, clearly we would be delevered a little bit, as I mentioned, because we would be losing about $200 million of EBITDA. And our objective would be over the next 18 to 24 months is to get our debt-to-EBITDA ratios closer to 2, the way that the credit agencies measure it, and that would basically be strong investment credit grade. That's part of our financial -- long-term financial objective and continues to be the case. So there are occasions like this where we're slightly higher than that objective, but we work it down to that level over a reasonable time frame. The most important thing is that in that scenario, we do buyback some stock to offset a significant amount of the earnings dilution associated with the sale of that business. So we have a relatively modest dilutive impact in that result.
John F. Lundgren: And we -- and that's tremendous flexibility for our comment to an earlier question from Jason Feldman of UBS. That is all U.S. cash, so that's a -- gives Don and his team a lot more flexibility with respect to deleveraging buybacks, et cetera. So it's a highly possible scenario, but it gives us tremendous amount of flexibility that we feel quite good about.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Sandra, I think that ends it for us today. Everybody who dialed in, thank you so much. Please reach out to me if you have any questions after the call.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q1 2012 Stanley Black & Decker Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sandra, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kate Vanek. Ms. Vanek, you may begin.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Thank you so much Sandra, and good morning, everybody. Thank you all so much for joining us for the Stanley Black & Decker first quarter 2012 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, President and CEO; Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued after yesterday's close and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR portion of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's 2012 first quarter results and various other topical matters followed by a Q&A session. We encourage you to make one question. You can have one follow up after that. As always, please feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions after today's call. And as I normally have to do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act. With that, I will now turn our call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for being with us. An excellent turn out on the call. And with the first quarter in the rear view mirror, we remain well positioned, we think, for whatever faces us in terms of the macroeconomic environment. Solid results across the majority of our businesses, and we'll get into each and every one in a little -- in more specifics in just a second. Revenues per the release were up 12% year-on-year to $2.7 billion, organically up 3%. Our largest segment, CDIY shipments, grew 3% organically. POS is currently outpacing shipments, up significantly and Jim will talk about that a little bit more when we get into the segment detail. Industrial, the bright spot clearly in the quarter, grew 7% organically with strength in all geographies. Security grew 39% due primarily to the Niscayah acquisition, minus 1% organically with a series of low single-digit puts and calls. Again, Jim will provide more detail on that in our segment breakdown. So from an earnings perspective, x charges, $1.09. EBITDA was up 11% on a GAAP basis, $0.72 on a fully diluted GAAP basis; that, of course, includes all the restructuring charges. About a month ago, March 12 marked the 2-year anniversary of closing the Stanley Black & Decker combination. All aspects remain on track. We're significantly exceeding our initial targets and reaching our revised targets, providing further validation, as is the Niscayah integration, of a successful, scalable, global integration process. I'll touch a bit on Niscayah and a bit more detail. It's progressing well. We're slightly beyond the 6-month mark, all systems go. And as Don will discuss in more detail at the end of our short presentation, we are reiterating our guidance for 10% to 15% earnings growth and 20% cash flow growth for 2012. Looking at the sources of growth. Steady organic growth trajectory was established during the quarter. As you can see, volume was up 2%. We did get a percent of price, which was primarily carryover of previously implemented price increases later in the year, so 3% organically. Acquisitions, overwhelmingly Niscayah, contributed another 10% and currency was minus 1% unfavorable for a total of 12% growth. Looking at some of the specific businesses as mentioned. Industrial, strong plus 7% globally, organically. Our Professional Power Tools and Accessories business, new product-driven grew 6%. Our Residential and Mechanical Access business grew -- Mechanical Security business grew 6%. Consumer Power Tools, which does include outdoor, shipments were up 2%. Hand Tools and Fasteners up 1%. Convergent Security, down 3%, that's pro forma. With Niscayah and MAS Commercial down 4%, with the declines focused on our Access business and commercial locks and national accounts with some strong competitive activity, and Jim will talk a little bit about that and our feelings towards those businesses going forward, we still feel they're in -- they're high-margin businesses in very good shape. Let's look geographically at the first quarter versus prior year. Middle left if we start with the U.S., which represents 40% of our revenue. It grew 1% in total organically. Moving to the right, EMEA, Europe, Middle East and Africa, our second-largest geography, was flat organically. It was really a tale of 2 geographies with strong growth in the North, where the majority of our business sits offset by some significant declines, primarily macroeconomic driven in Southern Europe. But all in, Europe was flat, which was slightly ahead of our expectations for the first quarter on a global basis. Looking at our emerging markets. Latin America, up 19%, continuing to show strong growth across all businesses; Asia, up 10%, representing 5% of our revenue, 13% if we exclude Engineered Fastening in the quarter; and finally, 2 small but well-established geographies were down low-single digits, Canada and Australia. Lots of competition in CDIY and IAR in both those markets and some conscious business withdrawal of security in Australia. Just a brief update on Niscayah, as we've just passed the 6-month mark since closing that acquisition. So far, so good. I think is the best way to summarize Niscayah. But just a little more insight than we've provided in the past that we think will be helpful. No change in our target for $45 million in cost synergies and about $0.20 of accretion this year, $0.45 of accretion on a cumulative basis by 2014. We are managing this process the exact same way we manage all significant acquisitions, with a fully dedicated integration team and regular rhythms reporting to [ph] senior management, that includes Don Allan, Jim, myself and several of our key staff officers. All regions and functions are on track to meet or exceed their synergies. We do have a leadership team that's now focused on embedding disciplined operating rigor, as well as driving growth initiatives for this business. And importantly, 85% of Niscayah is in Europe. We recognized and included a weak European market environment in our original projections and commitments on EPS. And to date, our volumes in Europe are actually down slightly less than we anticipated when we put the deal together. Jim will talk a little bit about that as he discusses Convergent Security. Just one last point on Niscayah. 15% or only 15% of the businesses in the U.S., but a disproportionately larger percentage of our synergies are coming in the U.S. due to overlap. Those are 90% complete in terms of field office location consolidations, management consolidations. We have -- very capable commercial and vertical market expertise has been added to Stanley's Convergent Security team via Niscayah. And Europe remains on track as well, but as you all know, it's at a slightly slower pace due to the regulatory environment in Europe. So at this stage, at the 6-month juncture, good feelings about Niscayah, both strategically and from an integration perspective. Let me turn it over to Jim, who's going to take you with some more granularity through our 3 segments.
James M. Loree: Okay. Thanks, John. Let's start with CDIY. CDIY had an in-line quarter and continues to build momentum. Revenues totaled $1.228 billion, up 1%. Operating margin was $171 million, also up a point. Organic growth was up 3%, all attributable to volume growth, and price was neutral. The OM rate held flat despite a severe 230-basis-point inflation headwind, as productivity projects and synergies offset that issue. Along geographic axes the midteens organic growth in Latin America offset EMEA, which was down 2% organically, driven by weak market conditions, especially in Southern Europe. The all-important North American region was up 3%, but the encouraging developing story is POS performance. In North America, aggregate POS at our 9 largest customers was up 12%, with 6 of the 9 in high double-digit territory and 1 of the remaining 3 around 10%. POS for Professional Power Tools and consumer products were each up approximately 20%, while Hand Tools and Fastening was up in the low-single digits. Now conversely, organic sales by product line were mixed, as Professional Power Tools and Accessories were up 6%; consumer, up 2%; and Tools and Fastening was up 1%. Clearly, inventories of retail are lean and below normal levels going into the Fathers' Day and spring season. Looking forward, we remain positive on 2012 CDIY growth prospects for both revenue and operating margin, despite the European weakness and the timing of U.S. home improvement-related sales. It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that sell in to the channel lags sell-through at POS by a quarter or so when the first quarter POS gains occurred to abruptly and the market seemed to firm up so abruptly at POS. In our guidance, we've assumed continued sluggishness in the U.S., but based on first quarter point-of-sale the market now clearly appears to be firming for housing and home improvement. If that continues, it bodes very well for performance versus expectations as we go forward. Europe will continue to be a headwind, but it will be offset by strong new product initiatives, as well as revenue, synergies, gaining momentum in the third year of the BDK merger, and we're bullish on CDIY margin rates for the remainder of 2012 as ongoing productivity initiatives will deliver 2% to 3% productivity. We'll have very limited unrecovered inflation for the year. All the detail was in issue in the first quarter, this is behind us now. Thirdly, a boost from incremental cost synergies related to the merger, plus CDIY share of the company's previously announced $150 million cost reduction will impact the next several quarters. And finally, we are mixing into both emerging markets and new products, both of which have higher-than-line average margins. Our new Brushless DC and 20v cordless product introductions are now underway in a lineup of new Black & Decker branded products, and outdoor and home products is the most impressive in several years. So let's move to Security. Security achieved excellent revenue on margin growth, as the Niscayah integration proceeded in accordance with our expectations. Security revenues totaled $763 million, up 39%. They were powered by Niscayah, which closed last September and put $1.2 billion of idle cash to work. Operating margin was $92 million, up 25%. The profit rate was 13.4%, as Niscayah mixed it down from 14.2% last year. Excluding acquisitions, the profit rate was 15.5%, a healthy 130-basis-point increase over the first quarter '11. The increase was driven by strong price inflation recovery, as well as ongoing productivity initiatives. We saw some early analyst notes lamenting low security margins, however, those of you covering us for some time know that first quarter security margins are seasonally low. So it's important to focus on the year-over-year performance and not the sequential change in rate. Moving to Niscayah. Europe now represents about 40% of Security revenues, and given the European market conditions, this causes some short-term revenue pressures. However, our announced EPS commitment already assumes significant downward pressure, as I mentioned last quarter, up to a 10% pro forma organic growth downdraft can be absorbed with no negative impact to committed EPS accretion. And notably, the Niscayah pro forma organic growth was minus 4% in the fourth quarter and slightly more favorable in the first quarter. It was a mixed quarter for organic growth in the overall Security segment, which was down 1% in total. Resi mechanical was a standout for the quarter at plus 6%, benefiting from strong market conditions and share gains. Total CSS, including Niscayah, was minus 3% with legacy CSS down 5%. The latter was driven primarily by legacy international activities, the U.K., France and Canada specifically, as well as the wind down of a leasing program implemented in the U.S. during the capital crunch a couple of years ago. RMR was slightly up in the first quarter and new installs were flat. CSS backlog increased significantly in the quarter as orders were up 6%. Commercial and mechanical revenues were down 5% due to weakness in the contract construction channel, which was exacerbated by a shift or continuing shift to midprice point products. In summary, a big sales and profit growth quarter for Security, with most of the benefit coming from the Niscayah acquisition and Resi mechanical organic growth performance. The overall security organic growth picture is more promising for 2Q, with a growing CSS backlog in the U.S. and strong first quarter order activity. Europe will remain tepid, but Niscayah will continue to perform in-line with our commitment. And now onto Industrial. Once again, Industrial delivered a strong performance. Revenues were $662 million, up 7% organically. Operating margin was $124 million, up 19%. Profit rate was a record 19%, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Volume leverage, productivity and solid price inflation recovery all contribute to the expansion. Performance was strong across the businesses with IAR, Engineered Fastening, and Infrastructure all hitting their stride. The Industrial businesses continue to be on a great run, with 10 consecutive quarters of margin expansion, cooperative markets in most regions of the world, good organic growth momentum and above-line average profitability levels across the segment. And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. We start on Page 11 and walk through the working capital performance for the first quarter. You can see that the Stanley Fulfillment System continues to drive progress in working capital, where our turns went from 5.6 in the first quarter of 2011 to 6.0 in the first quarter of this year. Obviously, I'll remind everybody of the seasonality effect that we experienced with working capital from the fourth quarter through the first quarter every year, primarily due to our CDIY business, as we see a significant shift in the timing around receivables and inventories in the fourth quarter as they wind down in the later stages of December. And then in the first quarter with a slow first 2 months and then March volume accelerating in manufacturing activity for the spring season. Really drives that dynamic. So we saw a retraction of our working capital turns from 7 turns in the fourth quarter to 6 in the first quarter, but I would expect by Q2 that we'd be bouncing back very close to where we were in Q4 and then we'll continue to make progress throughout the remainder of the year. And I'll touch on that in a little more detail when I get into guidance later on. Looking at the different pieces of working capital, you can see that we continue to make improvements in the area of accounts payable with term changes, process improvements, centralizing sourcing, et cetera have really driven significant benefit in that particular area. It's an area of focus, as many of you know, in the early stages of implementing the Stanley Fulfillment System. We've made great progress in receivables due to the timing issue. You don't see it necessarily in the first quarter, but you definitely will see that continue as the year progresses. And then inventory continues to be our big opportunity. We've made nice progress in that in 2011, but 2012 is another opportunity for us to reduce days in inventory levels and continue to make progression around process improvements. We definitely feel like we're on our journey to 10 working capital turns by the middle of this decade. So with that, we'll move to Page 12. I would just like to remind various folks about how our performance has been versus our peer group over the last 3 years. The Stanley Fulfillment System really is a proven competitive advantage for us. As you can see on Page 12, for 2009, 2010 and '11, our working capital turns significantly outpaced our peers in many ways. In 2009, we were close to 8 turns, well above the peer averages. If we look at -- in 2 different peer groups: Industrial and Tool peers and then our Security peers. And you can see that we significantly outpace their performance in that time frame. Same thing in 2010, when you look at Legacy Stanley at 8.6 turns. And then as we integrated Black & Decker, we were at 5.7, so we kind of had a bit of a restart around the Stanley Fulfillment System and we made a lot of significant progress. As you know, in 2011, we got the total combined company up to 7 working capital turns. Again, significantly outpacing our peer groups, which were approximately at 6 turns at the end of 2011. But even more importantly, if you look at the free cash flow conversion, and again, free cash flow for us is before dividends but includes capital expenditures, our free cash flow conversion has significantly outpaced our peer group as well. And you can see 187% in 2009, 150% in 2010, and then 102% in 2011. These are GAAP numbers, and they do include restructuring charges associated with M&A activity. For 2011, if you exclude that, we were actually at 115% free cash flow conversion in that time frame. Again, significantly outpacing our peer group. So we really feel like we've illustrated our continued ability to outperform in this particular area. And many of you are aware how significant the Stanley Fulfillment System is in our culture, and our processes within our company. So with that, I'd like to turn to 2012 outlook. We are reiterating our outlook for 2012. We believe our earnings per share will grow 10% to 15%, and that's $5.75 to $6 as John mentioned earlier on. And just a few key operating assumptions embedded in there. As we indicated back in January, we believe our organic net sales will increase 1% to 2% on a pro-forma basis, so when you include Niscayah in our revenue base for 2011, it should be approximately $11 billion. This also includes the impact of the BDK revenue synergies, as we continue to make progress in that area. We have cost synergies related to the BDK and Stanley merger of $115 million or $0.50. This year, that's incremental year-over-year, and then $45 million due to the Niscayah acquisition that John touched on, which is $0.20 in EPS. The cost reductions we embarked on that we completed in the first quarter, that are behind us now, of $150 million of an impact in 2012. Results in $0.70 earnings accretion for 2012. As a reminder, we also gave an indication of geographic organic revenue performance for this year back in January, and we are reiterating those items as well in this particular outlook. North America, we believe, will still be up by 1%, so it's reflecting modest market share gains and no U.S. residential construction rebounds. Performance is consistent with what we saw in Q1. But as Jim indicated as he reviewed CDIY, there's clearly indicators that POS is getting stronger and may be the potential for stronger performance, but we'll continue to monitor that as we move forward. Europe, we have down 3% in the first quarter. They were relatively flat as John touched on. But we still have concerns about certain areas of Europe, in particular, Southern Europe, where they're showing significant declines. And we believe that Europe, for the year, will be down 3% given those conditions. Emerging markets, up 10% to 15%, so that would be a slightly slower growth than what we experienced in 2011. And Q1 was slightly better than 15%, closer to 16% to 17%. So we continue to monitor that to see what types of activities are occurring within the different emerging markets. The end result from a free cash flow perspective is that we do believe we'll be at $1.2 billion free cash flow before various M&A charges and payments, and that does assume a modest working capital benefit within there, as we continue to make progress with the implementation of Stanley Fulfillment System versus our achieving 7 working capital turns in 2011. On Page 14, a little more color on our thoughts around outlook associated with the different segments. CDIY, for revenue, we believe, we're still looking at a low single-digit organic revenue growth performance. At this stage, we continue to monitor POS to see if that will change in the second quarter. We feel very good about the successful launch of our 18 to 20v cordless products that occurred last year that continue carry over into the first half of 2012. And there'll be various new products launched later in the year for the back-half performance that allow us to continue to gain share in different channels. We do believe weakness in Europe will continue, but it will be more than offset by a modest growth in North America and then continued strength in both Latin America and Asia. In Security, we're looking at low single-digit organic revenue growth performance, so even though we had a slight revenue decline Q1, we expect that to change in Q2, as Jim indicated, and continue through the remainder of the year. We have embedded a negative retraction for Niscayah revenue within our earnings, or EPS accretion, estimate of $0.20 up to a 10% decline, as Jim also stated. Despite the drag on the segment margin due to Niscayah, due to the various cost synergies and cost containment actions, we do expect the operating margin rate to improve significantly in Q2 and continue to perform better throughout the second half of this year. The Industrial segment, really strong performance in Q1 from a revenue perspective. We do expect that to slow down slightly as the year continues, as the comps get more difficult as the year progresses. Our IAR business continues to be strong in emerging markets, so we expect that strength to continue. Although it will begin to slow down a little bit from a growth perspective in North America, although we will continue to see growth. But we do expect to see some weakness and slight retraction in Europe in that particular business. Our Engineered Fastening business, mid-single digit organic growth for the year as the recovery in Japan continued, and that continues to be a strong performer for us. But we do expect to see slower auto production in Europe, although it will result in growth it will be a much less growth than what we experienced in 2011. So to summarize the presentation portion of the call this morning, we continue to be focused on margin accretion and top line growth. They are our top priorities for 2012, along with focusing on the integration of various acquisitions, primarily Niscayah. We've taking proactive cost actions. We're prepared to respond to market growth if it's greater than what we're anticipating. We're also rolling out new products. We try to gain as much share as possible in all our different businesses. Our long-term capital allocation strategy continues to be the same. We indicated back in January that we were evaluating a meaningful dividend increase. In 2012, we believe that we will have a significant meaningful dividend increase that will be anticipated in the second half and it most likely will be in July, as we want to get back to our normal timing around dividend increases that we had before the merger. The Stanley Fulfillment System, as I touched on, continues to drive great improvement and we're focused on our mid-decade goal of the 10 working capital turns. And as a result, we believe we'll have $1.2 billion in free cash flow for 2012, which will be a 20% increase from 2011. That concludes the presentation portion of the call.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Great. Sandra, if we could open up for Q&A now?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Jason Feldman from UBS.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So if we use the historical 18% to 19% of annual earnings for the first quarter -- the first quarter seems consistent with your full year guidance, but you seem to be very confident that Security margins will kind of progress over the course of the year and improve from the Niscayah synergies, kind of better than normal seasonality. What's the offset in the other direction? Why shouldn't the first quarter actually be smaller than that 18% to 19% or the full year number be higher?
Donald Allan: Well, I think, Jason, the -- I think the 18%, 19% clearly, as you indicated, represents the historical view of the 2 different companies, primarily driven by a lot less volume in the first quarter versus the other 3 quarters. We tend to have $250 million to $300 million less volume in the first quarter as a result of that seasonality, primarily in CDIY, but also in our Security business. It drives a lot of that. So we do expect continued operating margin rate expansion and additional growth in our Security segment as the year progresses, so we do expect that to improve significantly versus the first quarter. I wouldn't necessarily expect that our Industrial segment would continue with a 19% operating margin rate that we saw in the first quarter. We're really pleased with that performance, but as we look at the investments we're making in that area as well as a slightly lower volume growth as the year progresses, I would expect that, that will return back to levels that are closer to 17%.
John F. Lundgren: Jason, this is John. Just to -- to be very specific, because of a lot of those on the call have not followed the company for 10 years, as Jim alluded to. The 2 specific seasonality items, to which Don referred, and CDIY, as it’s been quite evident over the years. January is always a very soft month in terms of shipments as the big-box retailers wind down their inventory in the anticipation of their year-end close in January. It does ramp up in Feb, March, but first quarter for CDIY is always a relatively soft quarter, as Don suggested. And then within Security, there is the seasonality to which you referenced, but for -- I guess, for others' benefit, normally that's in Access and in MAS, Commercial MAS. Within Access, there's often weather-related delays in terms of snow, rain, flooding. Far less of that this year than in the past, but most of that's focused on national accounts and a lot of our retrofits aren't scheduled until the second quarter so they don't face weather delays. And on the MAS business, we do a tremendous amount of business on university campuses, also, albeit [ph] more and more business with our Convergent Security Solutions and it stands to reason the overwhelming majority of that business happens in June, July and August when there are fewer students on the campus. So second and third quarters for years have been better quarters than first and fourth for Security. So I hope that, that adds just a little more color to what I think is fairly well understood, but if not, it's an important clarification.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, that's very helpful. And then lastly, I think kind of given positive commentary from some of the big retailers in first quarter construction activity. I think some people may have thought the CDIY, from a revenue perspective, could have been a little bit stronger. Can you elaborate on, I guess, 2 points, how much of a difference was there, how much of an impact did the difference between POS and your shipments make in the quarter? And also, how much of a lag -- I think you've talked about this before, but if you can kind of refresh our memory on how much of a lag there is between any pickup in construction activity and when you actually start to see the benefit for CDIY sales, [indiscernible] in the quarters typically?
John F. Lundgren: Jim, can you [indiscernible]...
James M. Loree: I mean I think I covered a lot of the POS versus shipments, but I'll hit the numbers again very quickly. The POS was up 12% for the quarter, and as you know, organic growth was up about 3%. So clearly, there was a significant lag in terms of the sell in to the channel. It is not surprising to me at all. When you think about how the quarter unfolded in the sense that the fourth quarter POS was probably in the neighborhood of 1% positive, and then all of a sudden in January, it's up 10% and it's up 10% all quarter, it didn't get stronger, it didn't get weaker, it just stayed up 10%. So it's almost like a switch was flipped and POS was up 10%. And given that, if I were a retailer and given the warm weather, I would be sitting there saying it's a weather-related pull-in at first. I certainly don't want to bet a bunch of inventory on the fact that, that might not be the -- or that might be the case -- not the case. And then so, normally, we would have a lag of probably about 60 to 90 days anyway, so -- and if you listen to some of the commentary from the retailers, they were clearly citing the weather as a factor. Now whether that was just an attempt to kind of tamp down expectations or whether that was a real issue or how much they attributed that in reality to that phenomenon, I think it's up for discussion or debate. But there was clearly -- that piece of it had a big impact, and I think they were maintaining a cautious stance in terms of -- throughout the quarter, with regard to buying additional product and building their inventories and we know that they ended the quarter with some of the leanest inventories we've seen in a long, long time at retail.
Operator: And the next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays Capital.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So I wanted to just follow up, Jim, on what you were just talking about. I thought I heard you say in your opening remarks that in your view, given the POS data, that it seems like U.S. housing is, I think you used the phrase "clearly recovering," but I might have misheard you. I guess, my question relates, given the strong POS that you've seen here, I was wondering if you could give us a sense for why you're still sort of waiting for Q2 to shape up and if you -- and if there's something that maybe you haven't mentioned that gives you pause and makes you think, perhaps there is, let's say, a weather-related effect or something about the mix of what kinds of products you're seeing very strong POS versus what kinds of products you're not or -- if there's something like that.
James M. Loree: Yes. Well, look, the POS was very strong in Power Tools and in Consumer Products, including Power Tools and Outdoor products. So Outdoor, while it may have been weak last year, if you recall the weather was extremely unfavorable last year, it certainly reversed itself this year, and the POS and Outdoor was up, close to 30%. But Power Tools was up about 20% in the aggregate, a little bit less if you take Accessories and put them into the equation. Now I think some of that is clearly share gain. I don't think you're going to see a home improvement POS numbers around 20% for the Tool category. Some of that was clearly weather. There's no doubt in my mind. We had a somewhat weaker POS last year in the first quarter and I could attribute that to some very, very cold and negative weather conditions. However, I think it would be foolish to assume that all of it is weather or even the preponderance is weather. I think that clearly if you look at almost any housing-related statistic in the country, you'll see some modest improvement. And I think people are going back to work gradually in construction projects. I think, maybe even a bigger part of it, home improvement projects, where you had several years of deferral of do-it-yourself projects. We clearly have heard from some of the retailers that they believe that is a factor. So I think it's a mixed bag of things, but general economic conditions are better, confidence is higher. I mean, it's a -- there is, in my opinion, a clear indication that the home improvement market is getting better and it's not just due to weather. Now some of it is absolutely due to weather.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. That's really -- okay, that was really great. I appreciate that. I guess, as a follow-up, can you give us an indication for how you're Bostitch business or your Fastenings business did, and specific I'm talking about the Bostitch type business. And you had -- and Accessories. You had mentioned -- I think you just mentioned that Accessories POS was not up as much as 20%, but I just want to make sure I heard you. I'm really interested in how Accessories and Bostitch, particularly the nail sales, performed in the quarter.
James M. Loree: I mean the Accessories business was -- POS was up about 8% in the quarter, so not the stunningly positive performance that you saw in Power Tools. But still a very respectable performance at plus 8%. And then the Bostitch business was down in the low-single digits. I couldn't give you the exact number, but it was probably in the 1% to 2%, 3% kind of a range. The Bostitch business and the nails in particular will be much more tied to home construction as opposed to doing improvement projects than, say, the Power Tools. And I think that's probably why we got some increase in home construction, but it wasn't as notable as I think in the home improvement area.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, Steve, because you'll get cut off, I mean, just 2 specifics that we have shared and we're happy to, the largest single use, as Jim suggests, above the trends that are the structured housing, the second largest use is pallet repair. So to the extent that the economy is good and industry is good and product is moving on pallets, a very large use of Bostitch or a large consumption of Bostitch products is in pallet. More pallet repair than pallet making, but it's very important in that vertical market.
Operator: And the next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan Chase.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just to -- sorry, I don't want to necessarily beat a dead horse and I have my follow-ups on a different topic, but just to understand CDIY and the POS lag, which is helpful to point out, we did notice that you aren't necessarily at the same time raising your full year guidance and to the extent that a 12%-type number comes through or of a similar type of magnitude comes through in the second quarter that could certainly drive some upside to the overall guidance for the full year. Is that just kind of initial caution and you want to see how things continue because I think, Jim, you had just mentioned that you think there's something more than just weather at work.
Donald Allan: Michael, it's Don. I -- if you think about it from the perspective of how Jim described it, POS is a fantastic statistic for us to look at. It helps us as an indicator of where we see what's happening in our major customers. But we also have to look at order trends, and if order trends are not exactly in sync with that, which they're not yet, then it's not necessarily prudent and intelligent to raise your guidance based on an indicator that, although very positive and we feel good about it, we want it to continue, we want it to translate into orders and ultimately into revenues. And if that trend does continue at that pace, then we clearly anticipate that the revenue performance would be stronger in the second quarter than currently anticipated. But it's something that we believe in our philosophy and our approach that we actually need to see it translated into orders versus POS.
James M. Loree: Yes, and as I mentioned last year or last quarter on the call, the -- I guess, it was -- well, it was January, but in any event, we really wanted to position the company to outperform in the event that we had a construction market or a home improvement market recovery. And the reason being that the -- first all, it's a good stock to be in for that type of a recovery. And what happened was the European cloud that was hanging over Europe was causing some dissonance in that respect, so people -- investors couldn't really feel comfortable with betting on a housing recovery by putting their money in the stock because of the European issue. So we felt that we would simply take the recovery off the table and then the cost reductions were really put in place to make sure that we could cover the European issues, and so now the company is still positioned to outperform in the event that this home improvement and housing recovery issue or opportunity is real. And that's where we are today.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Just as a follow-up to that, maybe just so I can better understand. With the inventories -- it's a kind of 2 part, if I could cheat a little bit, but just to -- clarifying the first and then second. The inventories, you did note, are fairly lean, so I was surprised that you didn't see at least some level of an increase in order trends given the strong POS. So that's kind of the follow-up. The second thing is, on the Hand Tools and Fasteners, I was wondering if you could remind us about your percent of Hand Tools, how that is in terms of total CDIY, the rough sense of the magnitude. And we've heard that there's a -- Home Depot is doing a private label on Hand Tools that might kind of alter dynamics or competitive or pricing dynamics in that category, if you had any thoughts around that.
James M. Loree: Yes, I think this is absolutely typical. I mean, there's nothing new. The private label thing has been going on as long as I've been around and long before I even arrived here in 1999. It comes in ebbs and waves. And ultimately, in Hand Tools -- Hand Tools, there's only one company in tools that has the brands in Hand Tools, that overarching brand that spans all the categories that we sink a lot of money into, has more brand equity than any other Hand Tool brand, and we support it and we have a great end-user demand for it. We back it up with innovation and we are not private label. We do not -- we do very little private label. So let the home centers and the MAS merchants do all the private label they want. What happens when private label grows, the marginal brands get squeezed, and ultimately, we're at the high price point, the midprice point. We don't really play at the opening price point. Private label plays at the opening price point, tries to come up into the midprice point, runs right up against the marginal brands and runs right up against us. We tend to win, so we don't -- we're not terribly concerned about private label. We focus on our value proposition, which really is all about what the brand stands for and we feed that brand and we feed the innovation and we're happy to participate. That's the life we live in Hand Tools. Hand Tools and Fastening is about 20% of CDIY.
Operator: The next question is from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Research: Can you elaborate a bit more in terms of what changed with the organic decline in CSS in the order growth that you're seeing and what gives you the confidence that you'll have that organic growth going forward?
Donald Allan: As Jim indicated, we clearly have seen different trends in the CSS, North America business in particular. And due to some timing of some of the larger projects, we did see a revenue of flat performance or slightly down performance in that particular business. But the order trends are positive. We had a build in our order book in the first quarter, so we just currently -- we believe it's a timing issue and it's not something that's necessarily reflective of economic or market conditions at this stage.
John F. Lundgren: And just to elaborate a little bit, and obviously you don't get denied your follow-up. A logical conclusion, if orders are picking up, why wouldn't you jack up your organic revenue growth rate forecast? The issue, of course, particularly in Convergent Security where so much of it is first install and then ultimately, recurring revenue-related, it is really hard -- it's a much longer-cycle business than CDIY, where we have a POS that ultimately leads to orders, that ultimately leads to shipments. Quite often, we'll see the order backlog pick up, but it's for projects to be installed or things to be delivered 3, even 6 months in the future. So to translate that to a quarter, is very difficult for our Security team and obviously for Don's finance team to do. So we're encouraged by the order pickup, if not to suggest that it's all going to show up in the second quarter or even the third quarter as it relates to organic revenue growth.
Mike Wood - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then in the Engineered Fastening side, are you hearing anything from customers given that resin shortage that was in the news recently about anything that might curtail auto production there?
James M. Loree: Not really, nothing more than we read in the newspapers. It's -- I think they're scrambling -- they're all scrambling to make sure that they don't run into production issues, so we couldn't tell you one way or the other whether ultimately auto production is going to be impacted by that. But I will say that because we really didn't get a chance to talk about Engineered Fastening in the prepared remarks, that we're really pleased with the progress in that business and that the kind of growing content of aluminum-based cars in auto production is a huge positive for Engineered Fastening because of their self-piercing, riveting product line, and there's only one other competitor in the world that really has that and the content in aluminum vehicles is dramatically higher than in other types. So they've got great secular momentum in terms of penetration, and of course, the industry remains reasonably strong this year and perhaps not as strong as it was last year, but still pretty darn strong. I think the -- global auto production was up about 4%.
Donald Allan: 4% to 5%.
James M. Loree: Yes, in the first quarter. And I think we're going to continue to see, notwithstanding some exogenous interruption like you referred to, we're going to continue to see good production in the auto industry, and therefore, good results from our Engineered Fastening friends.
Operator: The next question is from Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was wondering in the COI [ph] business, you talked about the strong orders and the weather issues there in terms of holding back some of the order trends. But as you think about -- if you were to think about that improving, do you think we'll then see a slightly less promotional environment there as there's a bit more confidence that it's not just a weather issue, is that sort of what's driving the expectation that better margins will come through in COI through the rest of the year?
John F. Lundgren: That's a significant factor, yes. You'd said orders, Don was very specific. We have not seen the orders yet or we'd be more aggressive with our forecast. We've seen the POS, and as Don normally follows, night [ph], orders normally and shipments normally follow POS, but until we see them, we're not going to be encouraged. So I want to be sure you understood Jim's comments. But I think that's a very logical, I'll say assumption or conclusion, Dan.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then secondly, I was wondering about would the $150 million in terms of the cost reduction where there's been enacted [ph], how -- when should we start to really see the benefits of that, coming through at least the second quarter and then beyond?
Donald Allan: Yes, second quarter and beyond. We could -- we were I think pretty granular last quarter, but it's absolutely worth repeating and I'm glad you asked the question. Essentially, none of that showed up in our margin in the first quarter. We were often off and running by late January, early Feb. But precious little, if any, showed up in the first quarter. We expect more than half of it, 3/4 of it to show up the remainder of the year and some of that will, of course -- get carried into next year.
Operator: And the next question is from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Can you talk about the strength in IAR? Obviously, I think in the U.S., you're still gaining share. Europe was kind of surprisingly strong. With FACOM [ph] it seemed to me you're making a distinction between the north and southern markets. And then the strength you're seeing in emerging markets, how is that different than mature markets given the aftermarket exposure?
James M. Loree: Yes, well, I mean, first of all, I know that was -- was that one question, Ken? Let me start with Europe. Europe, I was -- I think we were all really pleased with the European performance. I don't think that the distribution channel in Europe has as pessimistic a view of the economy as some of the people I listened to on CNBC over there. But from -- I do think it's getting more pessimistic as the days go on, and maybe more realistic in terms of what's happening overall in Europe. But as we know, basically, Italy and Spain are really, really down significantly, like down as much as 20%, in that territory, and then the rest of Europe is much more sanguine. So in fact, the Nordic [ph] region, for instance, is quite positive in Europe right now. And as we know, Germany, where we don't have much volume but just to kind of complete the journey, Germany is slightly positive too, largely driven by, I think, the auto industry but exports in general. So I would expect it to get marginally worse as it sort of spreads, as the malaise spreads around Europe and the reality of the austerity and so forth sets in, in some other countries. The U.K. is a bright spot, I might add. The U.K. for IAR was quite positive. So mixed bag in Europe. And then the emerging markets, the distribution channels are -- it's interesting that the CDIY and IAR distribution channels in many markets around the world are -- there's a lot grayer and blurrier lines between the channels than there are, say, in the U.S. or in Europe or the developed countries. And so whereas in the U.S., you clearly have well-defined channel separation, sometimes in the emerging markets it gets kind of blurry. And so for instance in Latin America, sometimes it's tough to figure out when you're calling a distributor, whether they're a CDIY distributor or an IAR distributor. So for us, it -- and it's true in Southeast Asia and not quite as true in China, but even in China we see it to some extent, so anyway, for us it really -- it's actually an advantage, I think, to have our IAR and CDIY businesses because we can kind of go into the channel leading with, if the channel leans towards one or the other, those strengths and we can go in with those products kind of as the lead and then bring our IAR products or our CDIY products depending on which is the stronger kind of -- in there as well. I think that's one thing. The second thing for us, and one of the reasons I think we're making a lot of progress, is that when we put the companies together, Black & Decker and Stanley, we really got a much more significant scale in the emerging markets and we put a lot more emphasis at our business unit level as well. So for instance, now IAR, we've actually split the management of IAR, where we have Europe and Latin America is run by one gentleman, and North America and Asia is run by a woman executive. And the reason we did that is so that they could spend a significantly better portion of their time on specific emerging market regions. So Joanna, for instance, who runs IAR North America/Asia, spends a fair amount of her time traveling to Asia and working hand-in-hand with the regional people over there and making sure that they have all the resources, making sure that the products are tailored to that particular market and so on. And then Jim, the gentleman who runs Europe and Latin America, does the same thing in Latin America. So they're running their businesses, which are pretty significant businesses within the developed regions, but they also have much more time than if we ran them as one large business unit. And so I think there's different strategies that we're undertaking in every business to attack the emerging markets, but I think in IAR, it's going to be a unique one. It's an experiment to see if it works, but it's so far, so good.
Operator: And the next question is from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: If you can give a little bit more color on the margin trends through the years, specifically 2 points: one, is a little bit more color on -- I didn't totally understand how much of the 2012 cost savings showed up in 1Q. And then secondly, the CDIY margin, I know that there's a price versus cost improvement that takes place during the year, if you could just provide a little bit of sense of how that margin should improve as we work our way through the year.
Donald Allan: I'm assuming you're talking specifically CDIY, Eric, in your margin comment?
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: Yes.
Donald Allan: Yes. So obviously, the first quarter, as I mentioned, is the lowest volume quarter for CDIY. It's significantly lower by about $200 million of revenue. And when you look at that and you think about the leverage opportunity where a business that was -- performed at 13.1% in Q1, probably had, as John mentioned, a little bit of the cost reduction actions in the first quarter, but not a great deal that the vast majority of that is going to happen in Q2, Q3 and Q4. Recognizing those 2 items and recognizing that our company -- based on our current outlook, we're going to achieve very close to 15% operating margin this year. The CDIY business needs to achieve that type of level as well from an operating margin rate, which means it's going to get to levels that are around 15% and above as the year progresses. So when you look at price inflation, that's another positive factor associated with that. The inflation is clearly higher, in particular in the first quarter, and it begins to go down significantly in the second and then becomes very small in the third and the fourth quarter. And the price benefits of what we did associated with different actions last year will be a positive that rolls into that as well. And then there's ongoing productivity associated with just normal productivity that occurs every year.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: And then the underlying margin in the business, is there anything other than inflation, is that the reason why there's cost savings or is Black & Decker cost savings and the profits in the CDIY are flat in the quarter? Does inflation explain -- that's what's offsetting all of the cost saves and the underlying margin is stable, is that something you could help us with?
Donald Allan: That's exactly what it is. I mean, it's inflation and then the positives that we have are pretty much offsetting that, which is why we have a flat operating margin rate versus last year at Q1. But then, like I indicated, that dissipates significantly in Q2 and beyond.
John F. Lundgren: With volume leverage, 50% of the $150 million cost reduction over the next 3 or 4 quarters and what we feel will be, at worst case, neutral price inflation arbitrage, those 3 things all will -- all should and will contribute positively to the CDIY margins for the next 3 quarters.
James M. Loree: Yes, and I think if you'd think about the first quarter margin in CDIY without the inflation, it was a 230-basis-point impact. That would have been incredibly positive story for our first quarter in CDIY. So, yes, we have the inflation, so yes, we absorbed productivity and we absorbed the synergies in the quarter. We're not going to have that in the second quarter anywhere as near that magnitude as what's pointed out, and then you have the positives that were just mentioned. And I think it's going to be a good story as we go forward.
Operator: And the next question is from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Two questions. First off, as it relates to CDIY market share, I know we, we talked about POS a lot, but I'm specifically looking at sell in and reorder rates. I mean, the commentary in the channel was such where some of your primary competitors are looking at growth rates considerably above 3% for their sell in. So if you could give any commentary around that or if you're seeing any cannibalization with your new products, maybe the 20v is cannibalizing the 18v or the DeWalt Hand Tool line is cannibalizing FatMax, something like that? And then I have a follow-up question also.
James M. Loree: Sam, I mean, we could talk all we want about sell in. All that is, is a change in inventory if it doesn't have anything to do with POS. So 20% POS in Power Tools seems to indicate share gain, from everything I can derive. And really, I can't even begin to fathom why there would be major differences in sell in. That's just something that's going to have to sort itself out in the inventory line.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. My follow-up question. Last quarter, the valuation of the stock was more like 6x or 7x expected EBITDA, which probably precludes a lot of acquisition appetite on your behalf. Now the valuation is a little bit -- you get an extra turn and if it's closer to 7x or 8x, does your appetite now increase a little bit and what does the pipeline look like for deals this year?
John F. Lundgren: Yes, I guess 3 things. We don't give 6 seconds' thought to what our multiple is, relative to our -- and that's assuming an all stock transaction. And as Don pointed out, we generate $1.2 billion in cash, of which 2/3 is going to be deployed towards acquisition. So our -- if you will, our multiple being up or down a turn, Sam, is not a significant factor in our thoughts about acquisition. Our balance sheet is strong, our cash-generation capability is strong, thus from a financial perspective, our ability to acquire is strong. What will be the governor is organizational capacity. The good news is our 2 large integrations are going extraordinarily well, but if you think about Security, they're digesting an acquisition and integrating one that is almost 50% of their size pre the acquisition. Their plate's full, so obviously we can look for some bolt-ons that'll make sense, but we don't want to overstress the organizational capacity. Small opportunities in other areas where less of the organization is focused on integration. That's where you could expect to see some modest activity. But if you combine 2 integrations that neither of which are fully complete, Don has very publicly stated, and we have -- we've got a couple of $300 million of deleveraging that we intend to do. The pipeline is very full. It'll be -- more organizational capacity than financial capacity that will govern our appetite, speed and size for our acquisitions.
Operator: And the next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley.
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So I wanted to dig in a little bit to this Security seasonality issue. You guys went through a pretty big effort last year, if you go back to your 1Q '11 slides, to reconcile why you had margins down in the first quarter from the fourth quarter as well as year-on-year. And it looks like you guys you should be benefiting this year from the lack of HHI issues, from the lack of some of this acquisition dilution, from the lack of MAS inflation. So if you could just walk me through that, that will be great.
Donald Allan: Nicole, it's Don. I would say that you have to think about a couple of the comments that Jim made around, in particular, the commercial and mechanical business and the product gap that we're looking to fill related to certain products in the back half of the year. That has certainly caused some pressure to the profitability of that business, in particular this quarter, and in previous quarters as well. And then also some timing around some of the Access Technologies or automatic door business around that particular business and some of the ordering trends related to national accounts as well. So there's -- and then there's a seasonality aspect related to what John described, which is it's really 3 businesses in there, 2 of which I've mentioned. One is also the residential lock business that for the first quarter, is very similar to a CDIY-type business from a revenue perspective. So that -- certainly feel pressure from profitability in the first quarter as well.
John F. Lundgren: Well, and I guess, of equal or greater importance, first quarter '12 versus first quarter '11, x -- we bought $1 billion business with single-digit operating margins. It's math. It's up 130 basis points, excluding Niscayah, quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter. So I'm a little bit puzzled as to the need to rationalize the margins. But I think between the 2, remember the 13 4 excludes Niscayah. It's $1 billion business with single-digit operating margins that we will improve over time. But that's why we carved out x-Niscayah, it's 130-basis-point improvement versus same quarter last year, which is the one that was referenced in the question.
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And secondly, can you describe how the NiCad promotional activity trended during the quarter? And I guess, I just don't understand why CDIY margins would be flat q-on-q. It seems like price cost should be getting better. Volumes are clearly getting better and you have -- so just can you talk about that?
Donald Allan: It really goes back to what we -- what I said earlier, and I think John and Jim touched on it as well, is we have not, we're not completely covering inflation with price in Q1 in CDIY. And as a result, we have 240 basis points of pressure, and they're associated with inflation. That complete -- virtually goes away in the second quarter. But as we've talked about for 2 or 3 quarters now, that's been a pressure point in that particular business. We didn't have that type of inflation in Q1 of last year. It began to -- and the commodities began to trend up late in Q1, and we began to feel an impact of that significantly in Q2 and the rest of the year. So that is anniversary-ing as we go into the second quarter, but that is the main driver for why you're seeing that flat performance.
James M. Loree: And I think you're seeing a lot more -- or a lot less promotional activity in CDIY. As you may have noticed, the price was neutral. It was not positive, but it certainly wasn't negative and I think from a trend perspective, that's a good trend. And I think in that business, we've spent a lot of time with them. John and Don and I have spent a lot of time with the CDIY folks, walking through promotional strategy, level of promotion, promotional payback and a number of other things and how important it is to keep the gross margins moving in the right direction. And I think they will -- they have listened and have made some changes that are going to be positive as we go forward.
Donald Allan: Yes, just to add on, Nicole, because you will -- to Jim's point, which I think is an important one because you won't get another follow-up. We are very pleased with the increased level of sophistication, albeit from a high base of the CDIY team's ability to analyze the effectiveness of its promotions. If you think about it, you took 2 serious players in CDIY, but with Hand Tools and Power Tools strengthened, may be different drivers. I give the team a lot of credit as we shine the light on margins and on the impact, sometimes negative, of promotions on margins. Which promotions made sense, i.e., did the volume lift more than compensate for the sacrifice in margins and which didn't. They've done great work in the last 6 months, so that's just the long way of saying, we think we're a lot smarter about which promotions are effective and which aren't. And that takes some time with 2 organizations coming together with different databases and different strategies and I think we're cautiously optimistic that by us putting the focus on it and the team taking it very seriously and internally developing significantly improved analytics. We think we've got a better handle on it than we did 6 months ago.
Operator: And the next question is from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.
Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just 2 questions. On auto production, you talked about Japanese production and the rebuild here in the second quarter. But if you look at North American production trend, it's much higher here in North America versus the beginning of the year. So is that factored into the guidance for Industrial? And then my second question is, Don, what's the FX assumption now? I think you had a pretty conservative assumption at the beginning of the year. Euro's certainly tracking a little bit better than we all kind of expected and I know there's still risk out there, but what's the assumption now embedded in the guidance?
Donald Allan: Sure. On the Engineered Fastening business, yes, we have factored in auto production forecasts in different geographies around the world both -- and obviously, there's 3 major ones for us in North America, Europe and Asia, plus Japan, both of them. And we have factored that into our particular guidance in that space. From the beginning of the year, we felt that the Engineered Fastening business would be strong, not necessarily as strong as it was last year given some of the significant increases in penetration and market share gains that they've had. But based on where we are at this point in time, we feel good about projections for them for the remainder of the year, but we'll continue to watch that closely as the second quarter evolves. As far as FX, yes, the euro has improved slightly and as I indicated back in January, they're -- we were using roughly a EUR 1.29 to dollar exchange. And our assumption at this stage, it's about EUR 1.30 to EUR 1.31. And I indicated that basically a $0.01 movement in that would equate to $0.015 of EPS on an annual basis, so that could be about $0.03 of a positive, if you look at it from that perspective. But if you also look at a few other things like shares outstanding, which is a bit of a negative versus what we initially estimated, it's pretty much a wash.
John F. Lundgren: And weaker yen.
Donald Allan: And weaker yen.
Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. So just a follow-up just to clarify. The North American -- you've got 600,000, 700,000 units of increased production versus January forecast. That's in the guidance or embedded in the guidance?
John F. Lundgren: Yes.
Donald Allan: Yes. I mean, we look at those every month and every quarter as we get new information around auto production forecast, that's factored into Engineered Fastening business ongoing forecast process.
Operator: And the next question is from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: I have a couple of questions on the Security business. Clearly, without [ph] Niscayah 130 basis point margin lift is a pretty strong performance. But John, in your opening remarks, you mentioned that the Security business was feeling some competitive pressure, and I was just wondering if you could go back and talk about that if possible.
John F. Lundgren: Yes -- no, I talked about in 2 things, and I may have confused you. When I talked about Canada and Australia, 2 established markets, relatively small geographies, but I wanted to touch on them. I said there was a tremendous amount of competition in IAR and in CDIY. What I mentioned was in Australia, we have very small Security business as well as South Africa, that we are deemphasizing. It's that specific. Call it a conscious business withdrawal because it's below-line average margins and I may have unintentionally misled you. No, there's no abnormal competition in the Security business, either in the U.S. or Europe. The major players remain aggressive. Our focus remains on commercial. But nothing abnormal, and if that was your takeaway, I apologize, I unintentionally misled you.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: Oh, good. I guess the other question I just had, just kind of tying back to the earlier question on acquisitions and as you answer that question, you made reference to bolt-on acquisitions. But I guess, my question is, maybe a slightly different angle here. As you move through the integration of Niscayah, and you approach the completion of that process, can you talk about where you can go strategically from that point in terms of further acquisitions in Convergent Security, sort of larger acquisitions as opposed to bolt-ons?
John F. Lundgren: Sure. I'll have Jim take it, so I think we're all on the same page.
James M. Loree: I think we have a clear -- in -- when we stated our strategy about capital allocation. John mentioned that about 2/3 of our free cash flow will typically be allocated to acquisitions, it's been lower over time. So when you look at $1.2 billion, you're talking about a meaningful amount of acquisitions. When you look at the revenue objectives for the company, we try to get the revenue growth up into the double digits, maybe on top of an average of maybe 3% to 4% organic growth. So we're adding about 8, 9 points of acquisitions a year with that money that we generate. And so -- and John also mentioned the organizational capacity being a gating item. It's one of the reasons we have growth platforms, because we have multiple growth platforms. So we have Security as a growth platform. We used to say Electronic and Mechanical, now we just say Security because we run it as one business. We have Engineered Fastening as a growth platform. You can see we really like that business a lot. It has growth characteristics. It tends to be a little focused in automotive OEM, which is great right now, but it's not always great. So there's other growth markets in aerospace and electronics that are really -- other verticals that are interesting to us in Engineered Fastening, so you can expect us to be working on a pipeline there. And then we have 2 exciting new growth platforms in health care and infrastructure. In infrastructure, we did CRC-Evans a while back. It's been a good story for us, as the offshore business has grown significantly and that -- and we've had a weak market in onshore, but that hopefully will change as time goes on. And at some point, we probably will add to our oil and gas activities and infrastructure, maybe branch out beyond oil and gas to some extent. We're looking at some opportunities in that regard. In health care, the value proposition in health care is bring productivity to acute care facilities and bring patient safety to acute care facilities and security. And we have a small but growing business there that we will probably buttress up with a few bolt-on acquisitions to improve our value proposition, to improve our distribution reach, et cetera. Those are the types of areas. Now as it relates to Security, when you start to evaluate the available opportunities in security, especially in electronic, there's one very, very large company out there that while it's not for sale -- it could be for sale, I highly doubt we would ever do anything to acquire a $10 billion security company, so it doesn't look like that's in the cards. Once you get beyond that, you're into regional players in North America. You're into Resi security. Resi security in North America, we don't really like that. We like it better in Europe, but there's nothing really meaningful for sale in Europe right now. So there's not a ton of opportunities. I think we'd like to beef up our Security business in the emerging markets, especially Asia, maybe Latin America. Over time, you might see something there. And then finally, in mechanical security, today our Mechanical Security business is too focused on North America. We've been trying to globalize that for several years. It's been challenging just due to actionability of assets outside of North America, but there's always a chance...
Donald Allan: Commercial locks and access.
James M. Loree: Yes, commercial locks and access, both. So there's a whole series of different areas that we can play and we can also work on bolt-ons in the CDIY business to the extent that they aren't home center focused or to the extent that they're not Power Tool or Hand Tool-focused. So for instance, Accessories is a great opportunity for us. Higher-than-line average margins, higher-than-line average growth in general over a long period of time. And we are about half our market share in Accessories versus where we are in Power Tools. And by the way, the opportunities in Accessories are plentiful because it's a very fragmented marketplace, so I think you could see something in Accessories. And then also in some of the blurry areas between industrial, automotive repair and CDIY, you might see some activity where it didn't have home center content, and then you might see some geographical expansion in IAR as well.
Operator: And the next question is from Josh Chan from Robert W. Baird.
Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Hopefully 2 quick ones for you. You mentioned really strong POS in CDIY. The one category that was not as strong was Hand Tools. I was just wondering what caused that? And I know you have less share gain opportunities there, but anything else that you could highlight?
James M. Loree: Well, clearly, I absolutely believe that the market is stronger for Power Tools than it is for Hand Tools right now, and that's one thing clearly our product development, our new product vitality in Power Tools is exceedingly strong. So vis-à-vis Hand Tools. Hand Tools is -- if you think about the innovation opportunities in Hand Tools, they're at the margin, whereas in Power Tools, you have lithium-ion, which we came out with. Now we have brushless DC, which we're coming out with as we speak. And these are big game-changing kinds of product innovation areas, whereas in Hand Tools, we kind of go out into the marketplace, we go to construction sites, we evaluate how we can inch up the productivity of a worker by changing the tape rules at the increment. It's just not -- it doesn't drive the same level of excitement and so forth in the marketplace, but it supports the brand and the value proposition, et cetera.
Donald Allan: And I think part of it is just math, too. If you think about history of innovation in Hand Tools, much lower ticket item, $15 to $25 ticket item, far less pent-up demand in Hand Tools, we would think or suggest than there has been in Power Tools. So all of those are contributing, I think, to the spread between Power Tools and the Hand Tools.
James M. Loree: Yes, it's more of a replacement. Hand Tools is really more of a replacement market than it is a new product market.
Operator: And our last question will be from Michael Kim from Imperial Capital.
Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: Just to expand a bit on Niscayah, are you -- in your Security guidance, are you assuming somewhat greater headwind through the balance of the year than what we saw in the first quarter? And is that driven primarily by project delays or are you walking away from certain business or are there vertical markets or -- any color you can provide would be helpful.
Donald Allan: Sure, Michael. It's a combination of a few different things. Clearly, whenever we acquire a electronic Convergent Security business, there is a bit of a shift in the model and we like to achieve certain levels of profitability around installations and service and monitoring. And Niscayah's not any different in that sense, and so as we look at new installation revenue and new installation projects, there'll be certain projects that we will pass on because they don't achieve certain levels of profitability. And that's really what we're saying, when we built in a bit of a revenue retraction associated with that, combined with that there isn't -- obviously, 85% of the business is in Europe. And although there's a large chunk of it that's in the Nordic region and the northern part of Europe, which as Jim indicated, is performing relatively well in many of our businesses. There also is a decent amount of that business that's in the southern part of Europe, in particular Spain and Italy, that we do expect some retraction associated from an economic perspective. Those are the 2 main drivers that would really be associated with why we would see a revenue retraction in year one related to Niscayah.
John F. Lundgren: And just to add a little more, and hopefully it was clear in what Don said. Maybe to say it in a different way, remember that Niscayah's business, they are extremely capable with demonstrated skills and installation in systems integration. A much lower percentage of their business is recurring revenue in monitoring than our model, than our base business. So as we -- and I think Don said it quite clearly but just to amplify, as the Niscayah business mix shifts from a little bit less systems integration and a little more service and monitoring as a percent of total, some of the lower margin installs, although they're very good at it and very effective at it, if it doesn't come with the service or the recurring revenue, that's what we will pass on therein is the, if you will, top line headwind. But needless to say, it's favorable from a mixed perspective thus the margin accretion assumption that goes into the numbers.
Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division: And just to clarify in the margin accretion, is the mix shift roughly half of the overall expectation for accretion or is it the primarily cost synergies [indiscernible]?
John F. Lundgren: No, it's -- Don could give a better -- it's 80-20 cost out mix shift. The mix cost out will happen within a 12- to 24-month period. The mix shift is a very gradual thing. That's going to be 1 to 3 or -- plus year project, so at least 75% of its cost out, I'd say 25% mix in that short term.
Operator: I will now turn the call over to Ms. Vanek for closing remarks.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Thank you all for joining us today. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Operator: Welcome to the Q4 and Full-Year 2011 Stanley Black & Decker Inc. Conference Call. My name is Monica, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kate Vanek. Kate Vanek, you may begin.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Thanks so much Monica, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for the Stanley Black & Decker fourth quarter and full-year 2011 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, President and CEO; Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO.  I'd like to point out that our earnings release, which was issued after yesterday's close and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website, as well as our newly launched iPad app, which you can access through the App Store.  This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's fourth quarter and full-year results and various other topical matters followed by Q&A. There is some helpful information in the appendix of the slide deck as it relates to your model. If you have any questions, as always, feel free to contact me. A replay of the call will be available beginning at 2:00 p.m. today. Replay number and access code are in our press release.  And we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K, which we filed with the press release and in our most recent 34 act.  With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Just in terms of fourth quarter highlights and basically a summary of what we will talk about this morning, some points on the fourth quarter, some points on the year and a couple of points on 2012. All of which we'll get into in more detail.  Fourth quarter revenues per the press release, up 17% to $2.8 billion, organically up 6%. CDIY was up 8% organically, excluding Pfister. Good solid 7% organic growth in industrial. Security as a total segment up 1% with 4% organic growth in Convergent Security. And I'm going to give you some more granularity in that on the very next slide.  Fourth quarter diluted EPS of $1.36. That, of course, excludes the merger and acquisition-related charges. Fourth quarter diluted GAAP EPS of $1.05, also a significant increase.  Looking at the year in total, we saw revenues grow 12%, 4% organically from a $9.3 billion pro forma 2010 base. You'll recall the Black & Decker transaction officially closed in mid-March, 2010. So up 4% from the pro forma base.  Emerging markets now represent 14% of the company, that's a nice growth from the 11% of the company they represented at the time of closing and it continues to be an area of focus for us.  Diluted EPS for the year, $5.24, a 26% improvement. GAAP EPS of $4.06, free cash flow was slightly in excess of $1 billion and working capital turns reached 7.0, a 23% increase versus prior year and a 52% increase since the merger closed. That's clear evidence that the Stanley Fulfillment System's gaining traction and I think of significance. Those increases were across all businesses and across all regions, and Jim is going to give you some more detail on that a little bit later on this morning. Don's going go through guidance in detail. There was quite a bit in our press release, but we're guiding for 2012 of fully diluted EPS of $5.75 to $6. In order to get there and ensure we achieve it, we're also announcing a cost containment action with about $150 million of benefit in 2012. That benefit is separate from previously communicated and quantified integration-driven cost synergies, both from Black & Decker and Niscayah.  Simply said, since the last time we gave a preliminary look at 2012, the external environment is we've -- we've experienced a lot of headwinds with very little tailwind. Don will give you some of granularity but the euros and the reals have weakened significantly. The European economy is certainly weaker than it was 3 to 6 months ago. And there's some carryover inflation that thus far is unrecovered. We've -- that's what we've learned in the last 3 months, and we have 2 options, or had 2 options of accepting that and accepting higher risk and lower earnings or moving proactively as we did in 2008 to get ahead of what we feel get ahead of the curve where we're going to have more headwind than tailwind.  Given the choice, Stanley Black & Decker is always going to choose to move proactively to get ahead of the curve, and that's exactly what we're doing, and Don will give you some more detail on that as he outlines the guidance.  2012 cash flow, we think we'll approach or slightly exceed $1.2 billion. A lot of that is going to come from working capital, and you'll see the sources of that when Don and Jim walk you through a little more detail.  Moving on to the next slide, just in terms of where did the growth come from and how did it look by business. Primarily in the fourth quarter, as well as the year, continues to be driven by new products and emerging markets. More detail on geography in just a minute. But very encouraging organic growth.  Looking at the fourth quarter, 6% in total, most of which came from volume, 1% came from price, acquisitions out at 11%, adding to a total of 17% growth in the fourth quarter, 6% of which was organic.  For the year, volume was up 4%, pricing was flat, a little less than historical recovery of inflation for a total of 4% organic growth, acquisitions added 6%, you will recall Niscayah being the largest acquisition closed in the fall of 2011. And currency was favorable in 2011 of 2%, so for a total revenue growth of 12%.  I think that the box on the right will be helpful. It's a lot of granularity, but we've elected to provide it because I think it will help you business-by-business, think through where we were and as a consequence, where we're going.  In the fourth quarter, Professional Power Tools and Accessories grew 9%, nice strong finish to a very, very good year in which that product line grew 13% on the strength of 20 volt lithium-ion and some promotional activities supporting the nickel cadmium platform. More from Jim in a minute on that.  Industrial remains a bright spot across the company, 7% in the fourth quarter, 10% for the year. It's across all of our global platforms and just gaining tremendous traction since we've done a better job at managing some of those businesses as global platforms with regional focus as opposed to managing those businesses in silos as we'd -- as quite [indiscernible] we had done in the past.  Convergent Security grew 4% in the quarter and 4% for the year, while the Commercial MAS business had a good fourth quarter, flat for the year. Consumer Power Tools, including outdoor, had a very strong seasonal finish. That business is a little more seasonal than any of our others, that's some of the Black & Decker branded power tool items as well as Outdoor. But the Black & Decker branded power tool business did very well in the fourth quarter, around the season. It's flat for the year. You will recall a very, very weak spring in terms of the outdoor products, some of which was weather-driven but a strong finish resulting in flat year-on-year performance for that business.  Handtools and Fastening up 6% in the quarter, 1% for the year. As we talked about, MAS residential was down 5% in the quarter, 3% for the year and Pfister is stabilizing, it was 5% in the quarter, 20% for the year, and the loss of a large piece of business at a large customer in the late first quarter, early second quarter of 2011 will anniversary at that same time next year. So more detail on that within the segments.  So total fourth quarter growth, 6% organically, 4% for the year, solid performance, clearly above market growth in both areas, which obviously implies some share gain.  Moving to the slide on geographies, we'll take it, I guess, in order of size and priority. The emerging markets continue to be the primary source of our growth. But if we look in the middle of left-hand side, U.S. remains our largest market for the year. It's 52% of our volume and it was flat. Second largest market to the right, of course, being Europe. Good solid performance in Europe, driven primarily by our strong Industrial business in Europe, up 4% for the quarter and 5% for the year. Europe, as the emerging markets grew, Europe as a percentage of our total business is now 20 -- is -- was 31% in the fourth quarter, but up to the year, it's 27%.  Probably the next most important market to focus on might be Canada, just quickly, a strong finish, resulting in a flat year, at 6% of our revenue. Latin America, bottom left, strength-to-strength. We grew 26% in the fourth quarter, 25% for the year and fourth quarter being about equal to the year, reflects the fact that our revenue synergies are more than offsetting or completely offsetting the fact that, that market while still growing at nice rates, the growth in Latin America has slowed down. Our growth has remained at the same pace due to the unique advantage or situation of some tremendous revenue synergies between the 2 businesses in Latin America.  Asia grew 12% in the fourth quarter, 18% for the year. Fourth quarter growth being slower than the year is consistent with the market slowing down, still achieved share gains for the year in Asia and we're pleased with that.  And Australia, down about 4%, it's primarily CDIY, it's stable. Consistent with market performance. And Australia, we have a very strong franchise there, but obviously it's far away and it's relatively small country, represents only 2% of our total revenue. So revenue synergies, new products and some good marketing support are helping increase brand awareness, expanding our global customer base and that thrust towards continuing to develop our franchises in emerging markets will carry forward into 2012.  Last but not least for me, before I turn it over to Jim to give you some more granularity on the segment, I think we'd be remiss not to provide an update on 2 major integrations that are in process, and simply said, they're still in really good shape. The Black & Decker integration is anticipated to achieve another $115 million incremental synergies in 2012. That's helping offset a lot of the headwinds that Don will walk you through. It's -- that's driving $0.50 of EPS accretion.  We anticipate achieving $450 million in cost synergies by the end of the year, so we'll be at a run rate of $485 million as we leave the year. Revenue synergies remain on track, $300 million to $400 million, that'll add $0.35 to $0.50 of accretion by the end of 2013. We're just gaining traction there as the next bullet points out, a lot of that Latin American growth as I previously indicated, came from -- was -- contributed to $100 million total CDIY revenue synergies, which we're very, very pleased with.  Qualitatively, our best judgment is the cultures of the 2 companies are melding well together. The best data point we have is that -- is something we take very seriously. A global employee opinion survey, obviously completely objective, not traceable to individual employees as any objective survey would be. And 90% of the responses were favorable or highly favorable. We have never had results like that in our history. So it gave us a very, very good feeling that 2 terrific companies have come together with some similarities and some differences in culture, everybody's getting on the same page and we're focusing on the opportunities rather than the issues.  Last, but certainly not least with that integration, Stanley Fulfillment System's been fully embraced. You don't get CDIY working capital turns, which is where the majority of the integration takes place from where it was to 7.1 without everybody being on board and the same page. Jeff Ansell's team and Steve Stafstrom and the operating folks within that business are just doing a great job embedding that within our culture.  And as I think you all know, certainly we believe the road to improved margins and another source of cash that we can reinvest in growth, or return to shareholders is coming -- is the fleet of SFS being embedded across the system.  Quickly on Niscayah, we're still forecasting $45 million in cost synergies in 2012. It's going to drive about $0.20 of accretion and about $35 million more in synergies in 2013. That's the $80 million that we projected upon announcement of the acquisition. We haven't backed off from that at all. Most -- much of it is in Europe and it takes a little longer, but we have every bit as high a degree of confidence that we will achieve it.  The integration is progressing as planned. As I think some of you know, Brett Bontrager runs this business for us. Brett is probably our process expert on integration. He led the Black & Decker integration. So we have one of our most seasoned and experienced executives in the quarterback position.  Major upgrades to leadership are complete. With Niscayah, not surprisingly, it was a relatively small publicly-traded company in a spin-off, so there were a lot of folks, good people in corporate positions, not necessarily industry or subject matter experts, and as often happens in these situations, they have moved on to other opportunities. But the counter of that is terrific strength in field tech and field sales and installation, both in Europe and the U.S. So we've had -- again have the opportunity to combine the best of the best, the very, very capable Niscayah field leaders, sales marketing, operations, technology have joined the team both in the U.S. and Europe. So it's a nice upgrade with the combined team.  As you would expect, we have reporting rhythms and weekly project tracking. This has been our DNA, it's what we do, it's how we operate, and it is a very large acquisition and the processes are essentially identical to what we did with Black & Decker.  A lot of questions on the European market. We didn't anticipate the European market being very strong when we acquired Niscayah. The -- a relatively soft forecast for the global European market was anticipated in our -- when we made our commitment, and we haven't backed off from the synergies or the accretion despite probably more headwind in Europe than many would have expected or anticipated. We remain focused on execution. So all in, we've got about $0.70 of accretion from the 2 integrations next year, which we have a very high degree of confidence. We will achieve, irrespective of the macroeconomic environment in general, and that in Europe in particular.  Let me turn it over to Jim Loree, who's going to give you, I think, I know, more granularity on the segments and some of the drivers going forward.
James M. Loree: Okay, well thanks, John. And maybe one of the untold and really elegant aspects of Niscayah is the fact that it was a $1.2 billion acquisition that was paid for with no incremental debt or equity, i.e., a redeployment of idle cash. So not only is it accretive to EPS, but also to the return on capital employed rate and cash flow return on investment.  Well moving to CDIY. CDIY had a solid quarter and is well-positioned for 2012. Revenues totaled $1.324 billion, up 6%, operating margin was $171 million, up 22%. They delivered 8% organic growth, that was their strongest quarter this year despite flat volume in Europe. And they achieved a 170 basis point increase in segment profit rate -- in the segment profit rate, driven by solid execution of the Black & Decker merger synergies, as well as volume leverage.  Along the geographic axises, once again, high teens organic growth was achieved in emerging markets. Europe was flattish, driven by the market conditions there, and new this quarter is the fact that the all-important North American region picked it up a notch and delivered mid-single-digits organic growth.  From a product perspective, both Consumer Power Tools and Professional Power Tools and Accessories posted strong growth numbers, with 10% and 9% growth organically, respectively. These healthy increases were fueled by strong new product sales, especially with respect to the lithium-ion spectrum of products across the brands, and we received little help from the market in the fourth quarter. Most of these increases were driven by share gains.  The revenue synergies also had a positive impact, and then Handtools and Fastening was strong, but lagged slightly, the power tools units, add up 6% organically. This was also propelled by new products and revenue synergies, especially as it relates to the DEWALT Hand Tools.  Looking forward, we remain positive on 2012 CDIY growth prospects for both revenue and margin, despite concerns surrounding the European markets and to some -- and a lesser extent, the emerging markets. Europe will be a headwind, but it will be offset, we think, by strong new product carryover plus a strong new product pipeline, as well as revenue synergies, which are now gaining momentum in the third year of the Black & Decker integration.  We have assumed continued sluggishness in the U.S. but the market does appear to be firming for housing and home improvement but we really haven't seen a big rebound yet. But that could happen.  Lithium-ion lines will be broadened as we look forward and as we speak, and the line up of new Black & Decker branded products and power tools, outdoor and home products is the most impressive that we've seen in several years. So look for an exciting NPI year and a good act to follow what have been 2 really good NPI years already.  Any concerns on the margin front for CDIY should be unfounded as we enter 2012, with our ongoing productivity initiatives set to deliver 2% to 3% annual productivity, much more limited unrecovered inflation for this year, although the tailwind will still be an issue or the headwind will still be an issue in the first quarter. And we're mixing in to both new products and emerging markets, both of which have higher than line average gross margin. And that -- in addition to that, we have the big slug of incremental cost synergies and CDIY share of the company's $150 million cost reduction.  So in short, the table is set for CDIY to perform well, even if the European economy retrenches. It is also set to outperform and ride the volume leverage if and when the U.S. housing and home improvement markets take off.  And moving on to Security. Security forged ahead in the fourth quarter and put some excellent numbers on the board, while assimilating the game-changing Niscayah acquisition. Their revenues totaled $827 million, up 49%. They were powered by the Niscayah acquisition, which closed in September, and put $1.2 billion of idle cash to work as I mentioned. It adds $0.20 of accretion this year and $0.45 over 3 years. It is a high-quality franchise that needed some management attention and some TLC, but we're very happy with what we have and where we are in the integration process.  Security is now 30% of company revenues, up 23% from a year ago, and the Security revenues are now at a $3.3 billion annualized run rate. Security segment profit was $129 million, up 37% and their profit rate increased to 18.5%, excluding acquisitions. The increase was driven by strong price inflation recovery, acquisition synergies and ongoing productivity initiatives.  And now with the Niscayah acquisition, Europe represents about 40% of Security revenues. For the long-term, this certainly provides a better balanced geographic footprint than the prior configuration, and clearly enhances the overall value of the franchise. But given European market conditions, there may be some short-term revenue pressures on Niscayah. And as John mentioned, our announced EPS commitments assume significant downward pressure. We can handle up to a 10% negative growth -- organic growth downdraft, and it can absorb that with no negative impact on our committed EPS accretion. And notably, Niscayah pro forma organic growth was minus 4% in the fourth quarter, so pretty far off from minus 10%.  It was an encouraging quarter for CSS with overall organic growth of 4%, with relatively slack geographic markets performing well, for example, the U.K. was also up 5%, and France was up 6%. We had healthy order flow and installation sales were up 12% globally, with monitoring RMR of 3% with a positive outlook.  On the other hand, Resi hardware was down 5% organically. We don't think this is an ongoing issue. We had an inventory adjustment at our largest customer due to the implementation of an automated replenishment system. The PLS turned positive in the fourth quarter, first quarter all year, and Kwikset, we believe, is continuing to gain share.  We had solid organic growth at both MAS Commercial and in automatic doors, both were up 5% organically. And finally, the integration of GMT is going very well. This is a small but important toehold in China and the Southeast Asian markets.  So all in all, a very busy but productive quarter for Security, which is set to be a stable and profitable growth engine for 2012.  Now let's turn to Industrial. Once again, Industrial delivered an outstanding performance. The revenues were $641 million, up 9%, 7% organically. The operating margin was $106 million, up 19%. The profit rate was a very attractive 16.6%, up 130 basis points from a year ago. The drivers were volume leverage productivity and strong price inflation recovery.  At IAR or Industrial & Automotive Repair, organic growth was 9%, which included 2 points of price. All geographies were strong except for Europe where volume was up only 1%.  Organically, Mac was up 7%, Proto was up 8% and the storage, engineered storage business was up 18%. Asia was also up in the high double digits.  Engineered Fastening continued its strong performance with an 18% organic growth performance. Outpacing the global auto production, which was up only 4%. They achieved high double-digit growth in the Americas, Asia and even Europe, the latter in the face of modestly negative auto production. The -- their overall growth in Engineered Fastening was driven by new products, new applications and the resurgence of Japan.  Infrastructure was off 7% as CRC-Evans was impacted by regulatory-driven project delays in the U.S. onshore business. I -- need I say anymore about that. John says "no". The fourth quarter was -- capped off 2 years of exceptionally strong performance for industrial. So the question becomes, "What's ahead for this segment?" There are several inherent growth drivers in place for 2012, and thus we are confident of continued success.  Earlier this month, we completed the Lista acquisition, which will add about 3 points of growth and broaden out Vidmar's product lines and distribution channels. Last year, we completed a small, but very important acquisition called Crib Master, which as we speak, is unveiling a revolutionary new line of RFID-enabled tools and storage systems, which will play very well in the aerospace industry and will contribute to growth in 2012.  We're also putting an intense focus on the emerging markets, now about 15% of industrial revenues, and that will power strong double-digit growth in these markets, which will also benefit from the Black & Decker revenue synergies.  Engineered Fastening has a new successful stud welding system, and also a self-piercing riveting system, which benefits from the penetration of aluminum vehicles and should be generating a fair amount of growth. And CRC has secured a very, very strong position in offshore services. We'll see substantial growth in 2012 from that. And in addition, has won some significant business in joint coating in Australia, which should provide another $30 million of growth over the next 2 years. So despite the slow North America pipeline onshore market, we think CRC should flourish in 2012.  So there are several exciting new growth drivers that should enable a strong and successful year for industrial as we go.  And now we'll move over to working capital. This working capital story is exactly where we want it to be. We made tremendous strides with integrating the Stanley Fulfillment System into Legacy Black & Decker as John mentioned last year, and we achieved a 1.3 turn improvement from 5.7 to a very respectable 7.0 turns. That was a $234 million reduction in working capital. Excellent progress was made in accounts receivable and in payables. In receivables, we took out 5 days. In payables, we added 11 days. Those are both very good. The payables in particular came from terms changes and process improvements and nothing else. We benefited from our centralized sourcing and our scale, making that happen. And a lot of heavy lifting was done in inventories as well. And we should really begin to see commensurate improvement in inventories as 2012 unfolds. And we are on a journey to 10 working capital turns by mid-decade. We have the knowledge, the expertise and the momentum to get there. So you could expect more progress along that trajectory in 2012.  And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. I'd like to start on Page 12, and quickly touch upon the free cash flow performance for the company in 2011 and the fourth quarter before I move into 2012 guidance.  As you can see, we're very pleased with our achievement of a greater than $1 billion free cash flow for the first full year of our combined company, which really significantly outpaced our original goal, which was by year 3 post-merger, we would achieve this level.  You heard from Jim that the significant progress in working capital, and you can definitely see that in the cash flow statement as we had $255 million of cash flow in the fourth quarter from working capital, and for the year, a positive amount of $134 million, which is pretty close to what we were estimating back in our October earnings release as we do see significant seasonality improvement in working capital in the fourth quarter. So very pleased with the result.  As I also mentioned back in October, we do have a few unusual items in other that drive negative cash flow performance. And those items are: Pension contribution of about $80 million; and then noncash benefits from some of the tax items we had in our P&L as we settled audits of about $70 million. Those are the main drivers of the $200 million in negative that you see here for the year.  Another item of note is our CapEx. We've done an excellent job as a company of managing that to within our objectives of somewhere between 2% and 2.5% of revenue, and it came in at about 2.1% of revenue for the year. With the end result of that just over $1 billion in free cash flow.  So let's move to 2012 outlook on Page 13. As John mentioned earlier on, and also in our press release last night, we're guiding EPS to a range of $5.75 to $6. Let's walk through some of the assumptions associated with that, and then on this particular page and then I'll walk through a little more detail on the next page on a couple of the items.  The first item is organic net sales assumption for 2012. We believe our organic net sales growth will be approximately 1% to 2% in 2012 on a pro-forma basis. That includes the effect of Niscayah for a full year in 2011. This does include the impact of BDK revenue synergies in that estimate.  Several of you have -- are probably wondering why does that make sense based on the performance that you saw in the fourth quarter, was organic growth more around a 6% number and for the year, 4%. We're definitely seeing some signs and signals in certain parts of our company and particularly in Europe and emerging markets that things are slowing down. There is a possibility of a recession occurring in Europe, and no one knows for sure whether that's going to occur. But we believe it's prudent to put fourth an estimate that is more conservative in the sense of what could happen and how we might respond as a company, and specifically taking out cost to respond to that.  Additionally in emerging markets, we do see a little bit of a slowing in Brazil and China, although they're continuing to grow. They're just not growing at the pace that we saw in 2011, which in some cases, was greater than 20%, in particular Brazil.  Moving on to the cost synergies that John touched on for BDK and Niscayah. That contributes approximately $0.70 in total, year-over-year, $115 million for BDK and $45 million for Niscayah. The cost reductions that we're putting forth are approximately $150 million or $0.70 benefit year-over-year. And a little bit of color on that, about 50% of that $150 million will come out of our CDIY business, and the remaining 50% will be spread across Security segment, Industrial segment, and as well as some corporate overhead. And approximately 2/3 of that will be U.S.-based and the remaining third will be European based.  Positive impact year-over-year of $0.08, associated with our lower share count as we implemented the share repurchase program in 2011 of $350 million. And then we do have a $0.07 negative impact year-over-year associated with 2 items: Carryover inflation, net of price impacts, as well as FX or currency headwinds. I'm going to walk a little more detail on that in the next page.  Our tax rate, we believe, will be somewhere between 22% and 23% versus the 14% that we achieved in 2011 as there were a few one time items that we do not expect to repeat, and that's about a $0.55 headwind. And then interest and other should approximate $380 million in 2012.  We do believe our free cash flow will continue to increase as we -- we'll see another improvement in working capital year-over-year, and we approximate free cash flow to be $1.2 billion, based on these earnings assumptions and a modest growth in working capital.  A little bit of flavor of a geographic split for revenue. If you look at North America, we believe we're probably going to see a modest 1% growth, and it really reflects our ability to continue to gain some market share with the various new product introductions. It does not assume a residential construction rebound, however. As Jim articulated, as he was talking about CDIY.  Europe, we do believe will be down approximately 3%. That's currently what we've kind of forecasted within our company, and the cost actions are really in response to that. This does exclude the effect of Niscayah, and I'll walk through a little more detail on that in a few pages. Because we have baked the effect, as Jim mentioned on Niscayah, within that $0.20 accretion number for 2012.  I mentioned emerging markets slowing down, although we do expect them to grow somewhere between 10% and 15%. So it reflects a continued strong growth, as well as the continued impact of revenue synergies in that part of our company.  And the last thing to mention, it's just a reminder on seasonality. When you look at the different quarters, the first quarter does represent a much smaller percentage of our total year. And if you look at history, it's approximately 18% to 19% of the full year EPS. So just keep that in mind as you look at the quarterly split.  So on the next page is a detailed walk of the guidance, and many of the things I've walked through already, specifically lower share count, the volume revenue impact, the BDK and Niscayah impact and then the cost actions, as well as the higher tax. But I would like to spend a few minutes walking through the net inflation and FX number of $0.70.  When you look at that, approximately 2/3 of that $0.70 was associated with foreign currency, and the remaining 1/3 is associated with inflation versus price. Looking at inflation versus price, when we look at inflation, we look at all inflation, not just commodity-based inflation. So this has SG&A wage inflation in it, it has utility inflation, et cetera. When you break down the different components of that, we are fully recovering the commodity-based inflation in our price actions. So we're very pleased to see that in our estimates for 2012. But the other inflation is something that is a carryover negative impact or a new impact in 2012 associated with other types of inflation and it's approximately, as I mentioned, 1/3 of that $0.70.  The FX component is really driven by 3 currencies. If you look at the operating margin for our international businesses, approximately 3 quarters of the international operating margin is impacted by 3 currencies: The euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar. The average rate for some of those, as an example the euro was a $1.39 in 2011 and the spot rate has been anywhere from $1.27 to $1.30 over the last month. That's about a 7% to 10% decline from the average in 2011. The Brazilian real, very similar, about a 10% to 11% decline when you look at it from that perspective and the Canadian dollar, although not as significant, has been somewhere between 3% to 4% of a decline. So clearly, that has a significant impact on our company.  A little rule of thumb that we've used in the past is when you look at the euro and the euro movement, if it moves $0.01, it tends to be, what we've said in the past is about $0.01 of EPS. Based on our current makeup, we think it's actually closer to $0.015 EPS now versus $0.01. So just a little guideline for those interested in that information.  On the next page, I'd like to spend a little time on Europe, because there's been a lot of questions about the makeup of our company in Europe and potential for recession or concerns for a slowdown in that part of the world. So if we start with the 3 segments and look at -- first of all, look at the Security segment on a pro forma basis, which is -- will be about 35% of our European business at $1.1 billion. As we've mentioned a few times on the call this morning, this revenue weakness that we're anticipating is built into the Niscayah EPS commitments. And we do believe about 2/3 of the revenue associated with this business, is in relatively stable countries in Europe. The business looking back, is about 20% off the 2008 peak, and it's at trough levels. So we have not really seen a recovery at this stage in our Security business.  Moving to industrial, approximately $700 million in revenue. Two main businesses there: Engineered Fastening and Industrial & Automotive Repair. Engineered Fastening has actually seen a significant rebound from the 2009 low they experienced. And are approximately 100% back to peak levels in response to that low.  So it's about $85 million of revenue rebound from the low in that particular business. One thing to note about this business though is that it's heavily concentrated in German automotive manufacturing or production. And we've seen a lot of strength in that part of the business in 2011, although we don't expect it to be quite as strong as from a growth perspective in 2012. We think it's remote that we'll actually see a retraction in that revenue in 2012.  Moving to Industrial & Automotive Repair, they recovered about half from their low performance in 2009. So a peak performance that brought them down about 20% in revenue, they've recovered about half of that since 2009. And that's approximately $50 million in revenue.  On the CDIY side, 30% decline from the peak, down to the low period and now they've recovered about 10%, or about $100 million in revenue since that low. So when you look at this, you have 2 businesses that if you're concerned about a recession, you're concerned about retraction in IAR and CDIY, which if they did retract back to the low, that would be about $150 million in revenue loss. Our 3% assumption related to Europe, assumes about half of that possibly happening, possibly occurring. So it's just something to give you a bit of an impact, although it may appear dramatic or significant, it really is not, as it's only about 1.5% of our total company revenue.  So lastly on outlook, just a quick flavor on segments, we've touched on a few of these items already, so we'll not be repetitive, but clearly, we're looking at low single-digit organic growth for all 3 segments, with a possibility of mid-single digit growth for Industrial. And CDIY will continue to have the rollout of the 18-volt lithium-ion tools in the first half of 2012, which will be a nice driver for the activity and growth and help gain market share. And in the back half of the year, we'll have some new product introductions as well that will be launched to drive that activity. We do expect weakness in Europe as I mentioned, and that will be mostly offset by some -- little bit of the growth in North America and continued strength in Latin America and Asia as I touched on emerging markets.  In Security, couple of items of note. The Niscayah operating margin rate will continue to improve as we execute on the synergies and the integration, but it will continue to be a drag on the entire segment in 2012. But as the year progresses, that operating margin rate will continue to improve. And then in industrial, Jim touched on these items around Industrial & Automotive Repair and Engineered Fastening. One item of note on Engineered Fastening is we do expect the Japan market to continue to recover from the tsunami disaster they had in early 2011. We've seen that in the fourth quarter and we expect that likely to continue in the first part of 2012.  So to summarize, the presentation portion of the call this morning, we're very much focused on margin accretion, really trying to maximize top line growth even though our outlook is somewhat prudent or conservative, we are focused on trying to drive as much market share activity as possible, as well as driving emerging market growth and revenue synergies. And we are, at the same time, focused on our acquisitions and integrating them in an effective manner as we've done over the last several years.  Our long-term capital allocation strategy remains intact, the same, and we will be reviewing the potential for a meaningful dividend increase in 2012 as the year progresses. The Stanley Fulfillment System continues to drive significant benefits and continuous improvement in our working capital performance, and 2011 was a great indicator of that as we achieved 7 turns excluding Niscayah, and expect more progress in 2012. Our free cash flow continues to grow, as it will be $1.2 billion in 2012. And additionally, we'll be able to achieve -- approach $6 in EPS in 2012.  So with that, we'll move to the Q&A.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Monica, [indiscernible] the questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Feldman of UBS.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I'm looking at the cost savings, newly identified $150 million benefit you're talking about this year. I'm trying to get a sense of 2 things: First, what sorts of projects does that include; and what the cash costs are associated with it, whether that's part of the $242 million of M&A charges or whether they're separate cash costs or aren't any?
John F. Lundgren: Sure. Don can give you a lot of granulary on that, Jason, because we've given it a lot of that.
Donald Allan: Yes, Jason, first of all, the point of -- what type of actions or this associated with, really what it is, is it's a continued evaluation of our organization structures and looking at combining different pieces of the organization, flattening out pieces of the organization, looking at our supply chain, as well in the indirect and direct ratios of their manufacturing plants. In essence really tightening the belt a little further into our organization to drive out more cost and be more efficient. Anytime you take on a merger of this magnitude, you're going to have inefficiencies as you put 2 companies together. We've done a lot of great things with the integration and had significant cost synergies associated with it. But this is an opportunity for us to really, as I said, tighten the belt a little further. As far as the actual cost associated, is included in the $240 million estimate and it's approximately $55 million associated with $150 million of cost actions.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then last thing is, is $150 million benefit in 2012, what do you think the kind of annualized run rate will be as we exit the year?
Donald Allan: It's not going to be much higher than that, it might be $125 million to $130 million, because we're -- we've either taken some of these actions already, or they will be implemented by early to mid-next week. So the vast majority of them will be completed within the first 30 days of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Morgan Stanley.
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I just want to dig a little bit more into the cost actions that Jason just asked about. Can you guys just talk about how you view the tradeoff between cost-cuttings and investment. And the reason I'm just a little bit concerned here is because we've been cutting costs here for the past 2 years. And just give us some comfort that there's no cuts in the new product innovation area.
James M. Loree: Nicole, this is Jim. Yes, there are absolutely no cuts in the new product and innovation area. This company thrives on its new products and its innovation, and that is definitely something that is absolutely excluded from these cost cuts. You said we've been cutting cost for 2 years, we've been cutting cost for 12 years. And I think we're fairly experienced at it at this point in time. And as Don mentioned, when you take on, you put 2 organizations together, 2 $4 billion companies, and you plan an integration in the first 90 days of your time together and you come up with the synergies that we came up with and then outperformed even beyond that. You learn a lot after 2 years, of being together, almost 2 years of being together. And I think we're taking that knowledge that we've gained and we're really focusing the cost cuts on efficiency and effectiveness of organization. If you look at our track record over the years, when we make cuts like this, normally it's improved the effectiveness of the organization, and that's what we expect in this case as well. This has nothing to do with new product innovation. Has very little to do with go-to-market strategies or resource levels, and it has everything to do with efficiency and effectiveness.
John F. Lundgren: Nicole, this is John. I'll just add a little, maybe a little more light, because I couldn't agree more strongly with Jim that there should be anything but concern. An analogy that my colleagues and teammates are tired of hearing, but I think it'll really help, SG&A, we describe within Stanley Black & Decker internal speak as cholesterol, and there's good cholesterol and bad cholesterol. And my colleagues are laughing as I say this, but I think it's a really good analogy. If it involves new product development and supporting our brands, that's good cholesterol, not only are we not cutting it, we're improving it. If it involves back room operations, paperwork, processing, nonvalue-added activities or a duplication of effort, that's bad cholesterol, and we're eliminating it. That's exactly what Jim's describing. So I apologize for the simplicity of the analogy, but I think it'll help. SG&A in total will come down a lot. I think Don said that about 60% of the reduction is in SG&A and about 40% is actually cost of goods affecting plants and things of that nature. But of the SG&A reduction, it is all on the side of money that is required to spend -- that are required to spend to do business, but doesn't necessarily strengthen our brand or improve our product portfolio. And every P&L owner within Stanley Black & Decker looks at it just that way, approaches it just that way and it's a very serious trade off that we think about before we make any of the cuts.
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, thanks, John, that's really helpful. One more, if I may. Can you guys talk about some of the moving pieces in the q-on-q, CDIY margin decline this quarter, it was down about 30 basis points or so? I understand the year-on-year dynamics, but it seems like price costs should really be improving and the promotional spend should've been consistent with what you guys sell in the third quarter. So can you just explain that a little bit?
John F. Lundgren: Yes, you're absolutely right. It was modest, and as Jim said in his segment review, we don't anticipate it going on. We grew the business 6% in the fourth quarter when the market was flat-to-down. There was promotional activity on NiCad, and there was less than historical inflationary price recovery. We can make that comment with a 100% benefit of 20/20 hindsight. And so what you said is exactly right. There was very modest margin decline. That being said, we grew the business at 5x to 6x the rate of the market. The balance between margin and volume and share growth should be or will be a little bit different going forward. So I think your statement is absolutely correct. Jeff Ansell and his team understand it, again you don't have the -- you don't always have the value of all that information until you've closed the books. We were driving for volume, we got it, we got it at slightly less margin than historically we have. We've got a very, very good team that understands that, and we're highly confident they'll get the balance even better.
James M. Loree: And also, it would be remiss if we didn't mention that if you look at historical gross margin and operating margin percents for Construction and DIY, and if you disaggregate them and look even before these 2 companies came together, you would find the same exact pattern in both company -- in both companies, which is the first quarter generally is right about the same as the fourth quarter or slightly higher. The second quarter goes up, and it's the peak gross margin for the year, generally speaking. Third margin, quarter margin steps down a little bit, and then the fourth quarter margin tends to step down a little bit sequentially. So you can't really just look at these margins, there's a seasonality to them. On a pure -- everything is the same, so there must be something wrong if it's going down or something right if it's going up. I mean, there's all sorts of seasonal aspects to this. For instance, in the Consumer Power Tools business, if you mix in the Consumer Power Tools in the fourth quarter, it tends to have a slightly lower gross margin and operating margin than the Professional Power Tools, as an example. There's also Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, which tend to be days that people are paid for, but they don't do any work, and so there's a more of concentration of holidays, less productivity, less margins. And these types of things that just drive you crazy if you try to just track the margin sequentially at any 1 point or 2 points in time.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Next question...
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question just to go back and make sure I'm fully understanding, and great detail so far, I'm referring to the restructuring or further cost saving activities. I guess, you're saying that within a couple of weeks it'll all be implemented. Is that mostly headcount reduction or are there other buckets? And I guess, how much of it would you consider perhaps even further upside to your original cost synergy estimates when we started with Black & Decker a couple of years ago?
Donald Allan: Michael, this is Don. It's approximately 75% associated with headcount. So it's people-related costs, and then the other 25% is what we call discretionary cost and just hunkering down on T&E and other types of cost, consulting fees, et cetera and those particular, that's really the split. As far as how much is associated with synergies, probably not a lot. I mean, it might be maybe 10% of it or something like that when we look at it, but it's not significant.
James M. Loree: And to be clear, it's all incremental to the synergy. I think, I'm sure that came across when Don made the point, but this is not -- this is all in addition to the synergies that have already been announced.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Also on the $0.70 of net inflation and FX, this might be hard to do, but -- is, you kind of broke out the cost savings in terms of the different operating lines or operating segment lines. Can you give us any sense of how the $0.70 of negative impact from inflation and FX, is it -- can we think of it as a similar type of distribution?
Donald Allan: I would say that if you look at the 2 pieces, FX and inflation. If you start with FX, clearly, there's you have the CDIY business and Industrial business they're both very global, and so if you just look at the makeup of revenue, you're going to get a sense of the FX impact for those different businesses. So roughly 30% or so of the business is international. On the Security side, it's probably not a dramatically different ratio at this stage, given the inclusion of Niscayah. So I think if you look at that revenue mix, it will give you a sense of where -- of how things will go. And so, if each one of them is roughly 30% of the makeup then it's probably 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 impact roughly. Then you've got to look at the magnitude as well.
John F. Lundgren: I think we can use a little bit [ph] of the FX versus inflation of the $0.70 that you've already said, by the way.
Donald Allan: Yes, and so if your question was more around the split between FX and inflation, as I mentioned, 2/3 of that $0.70 is FX, and 1/3 is inflation. I thought you were going more down the path of give me a little sense by segment of those pieces. On the inflation side, the vast majority of our inflation frankly is in our CDIY and Industrial businesses, and the remainder of it would be in our Security businesses.
Operator: The next question comes from Dan Oppenheim of Crédit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was wondering in terms of the European business, I guess, you talked about that in terms of the risk and expect it to be potentially down 3% for the year. But then broadly speaking for the plans for the year in terms of -- talked about margin accretion, top line growth. When you think about Europe and then expectation for potentially if there's any decline in revenue, how are you thinking about margins there and running the business with a focus on so that preserving margin versus the revenue?
Donald Allan: Dan, it's Don. I think if you think about the cost actions that we're executing on, and roughly a third or so of those are associated with Europe. Those cost actions are in response to clearly volume and FX pressures. I don't think that you're going to see a dramatic decline in rate. I think we'll be able to maintain our margin rates in Europe as a result of the cost actions. That's one of the main reasons we're taking the actions, to ensure that we maintain them. And then when you look at the cost synergies associated with Black & Decker and the synergies associated with Niscayah, obviously those are accretive to the rate. So when you factor in all these different things, you're likely to see actually margin rates in Europe improving in 2012 even though you have a little bit of volume pressure.
John F. Lundgren: And as is always the case, Dan, I know you're well aware on -- the magnitude is proportional, Europe and U.S. as Don had said, we've done everything in our power to not slow down the growth of emerging markets. But geographically, those cuts are shared equally among the -- pro rationally among the businesses as well as among the very various functions. But it always takes longer to get it in Europe, which I know you understand well, 3 to 6 months longer just due to some -- anything that's subcomp-related procedures go with it, and it takes a little longer to realize. But that being said, that's built in to our guidance and our anticipated timing.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Great, and just related to that in terms of the proactive cost cuts here, you talked about that given the expectation that there could be more weakness. If you don't see more weakness, how -- is that just locked in so you'll end up having greater leverage in terms of the overhead and such there? How do you look at those costs -- the cuts overall if you were to see any improvement?
Donald Allan: Yes, one of the, I guess, if there's a significant positive associated with cutting costs, one of the positives if the top line performance is not what we anticipated, and it's better. The reality is, is we're taking cost out of developed countries that are more infrastructure and organizational related. That, frankly, you're not likely having a need to add that back, if you grow 5% in Europe versus being down 3%, you're not going to need to add back this cost that we're taking out because it's more structural in nature and organization based.
James M. Loree: Yes, and let me just also comment that the way that we are thinking about this too is that back in October, we indicated that we had a roadmap to get to a number approaching $6 when we, as Don mentioned earlier, found out that we had significant euro-related and market-related pressure in Europe, we decided to do everything we could from a cost perspective that made sense to protect that cash flow and earnings range that we were discussing in October. Because we really felt -- we really feel like we've set the company up very well to be a -- to outperform, when and if the U.S. home improvement and housing market returns, and we wanted to preserve that optionality if you will, for the investors, so that folks that were thinking that this could be a good proxy for playing the home improvement and housing rebound, but felt concerned about the European negative exposure could feel more comfortable continuing to invest in the stock because it still has the upside associated with the U.S. home improvement and housing rebound if and when that happens.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim of Barclays Capital.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I appreciate the detail. But as usual, we could always ask for more, I suppose. If you could talk a little bit about the working capital improvement and I guess maybe in terms of free cash flow generation, you've given a target of $1.2 billion. I'm curious if you could give us some sense for how that will be generated either by region or by segment if you were to take the regions -- I'm particularly interested in what you think the European operations are going to contribute roughly of that $1.2 billion. And of the segments, I'm particularly curious as to what the working capital dynamics and free cash flow dynamics of the Security business are in your guidance.
John F. Lundgren: Let me, Steve, let me start by saying we're just never going to provide that level of granularity on this call, and you know that. We can't hate you for asking. Cash flow by region, by business isn't something that we tend to, A, we tend to track ourselves, B, that we're going to put out there. What I can say, and I think Jim touched on it, but perhaps, didn't quite finish the thought, that's clear with us. When we implement SFS, the immediate benefit comes from receivables and payables because our very powerful global sourcing operation is involved and our field sales force and business controllers and business CFOs are closely involved. Normally, the dramatic improvement in inventory, inventory reduction and ultimately, in absolute terms and days and the result on turns, comes 6 months later because it requires more forecasting accuracy and better process changes. We have the experience of trying to reduce inventory for the sake of doing it, and with a negative impact on fill rates before the process changes have been put in place, that happened to us 2 years ago in Europe with our industrial tools business and we learned from that lesson. So more of the increment, to try to simplify it, will come from inventory improvement or we anticipate it will in 2012 because we've gotten the lion's share of what we will get from receivables and terms. Geographically, assume it's going to split about commensurate with our businesses and with our revenues, but there is no business or region that's particularly far behind or ahead. We run global platforms with local P&L leaders. Everyone is incented the same way. Everyone is equally focused on it. And while emerging markets are a relatively small percentage of our total, 14%, they're in pretty good shape in terms of working capital turns. And while you might think credit terms are loose or things of that nature, they're not because in many of the markets, the -- a lot of the business is done through letters of credit or cash. So in fact, the turns among our Asian business in particular are very near the top of the heap. That's about all the direction our business -- direction or detail that we're in a position to provide.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My second question relates to something Don mentioned. I apologize, I didn't quite grab it all. But he -- you mentioned, Don, something about the -- that the Security business and I think you meant Niscayah's specifically, could absorb business being down 10% and still hit your 12 EPS guidance contribution from that segment, and in fact it is was only down 4% in 4Q. One, I just want to make sure that I heard that right. And then secondly, can you give us an idea of what you're anticipating in your 1Q outlook?
Donald Allan: Sure. Jim did mention in his presentation that Niscayah, the assumptions of $0.20 EPS accretion does have a 7.5% volume decline built into those. That was part of the model that we created initially related to this transaction. And he indicated that, we could absorb as much as a 10% volume decline and still achieve that $0.20 EPS. So that's just to clear about that point. And also indicated that we saw about a 4% decline in the fourth quarter. So we're not really trending to that number, but we do have it built into our assumptions, that it could get worse as we do make business model changes, in particular associated with profitability, a third installation revenue project and making sure that it's more aligned with the Stanley Legacy Security business. As far as the first quarter, we don't tend to give a lot of information about first quarter, Steve. So I'll just kind of leave it at that.
Operator: Next question comes from Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just want to explore Niscayah. Obviously, it's a big acquisition for you guys. It happens to be in a market that's slowing down. So you said Niscayah was down 4% in fourth quarter. Was that a similar rate for the year, given it's 8% decline in 2010?
Donald Allan: Yes.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then, I think the $45 million that you talked about in Niscayah to me appears, from an execution perspective, very easy given that it is consolidating supply bases and kind of more back-office. But if I think about the HSM model and the integration that was very successful in the United States, I wonder if you could give us a little more color there, given that Niscayah margins were 6% in '10, looking to go to 10% in '12, just on your consolidation. But how are you going to balance the shift of going, trying to get higher installation revenue tied to recurring revenue amid a slowdown in demand in those end markets? Could you just discuss that, how much that hurts, if it matters?
James M. Loree: Ken, this is Jim. First of all, the integration, I would not characterize as easy, because there are multiple countries involved, with multiple P&Ls and very -- some very small, some very large and many different cultures, and Niscayah has -- some embedded -- a very localized embedded management practices that have to be -- more operated in a more central manner, while remaining, keeping their local flavor. So this is not a slam dunk. That said, we feel great about the $45 million. We have a very clear roadmap. We have very talented, experienced people in charge working on it, and so we feel good about it. And what we will do is essentially the same thing that we did with ADT France and the same thing we did with GDP in Europe and Blick as well, which is we will take the HSM model. We are taking the HSM model and we are implementing that so that you have a nice blend of central oversight with local regional management. And that's going to take about 3 years to fully implement. But this year, I would call it the low hanging fruit will be absolutely executed to get to the $0.20. And that's kind of the play here is that we are going to -- we are doing the things that are going to generate immediate results, have priority to do that and then there's kind of a medium to long-term organizational transformation that's taking place, which is why we put a very strong leader, Massimo Grassi, in charge of this who's multicultural, speaks 5 different languages and has been with us a long time, we know him very well and he's bolstered the organization already. He's mustered the resources from the Security business and they're working in earnest to effect this transformation, and we feel very good about what we bought --
John F. Lundgren: Ken, one other thing --
James M. Loree: It's going [ph] be a long haul.
John F. Lundgren: Excuse me Jim, I'm sorry. Ken, one other point you mentioned, mix and the need to do install to get recurring revenue, which we've been talking about for years. We've mentioned this on the acquisition call. But to remind you and everyone, the Niscayah business was heavily skewed towards install with a far lower than line average and certainly Stanley Convergent Security with recurring as a far lower percentage of the total revenue base. So part of Brett and Massimo's charge is obviously maintain the flow of profitable installation to keep the pipeline full, but to dramatically improve the mix toward recurring. And if you think about that, for those who have followed this company a long time, that was the HS -- the Legacy Stanley model, was much closer to the Niscayah model where we were way too skewed towards installation without enough recurring revenue and service coming with it. A very successfully HSM model, was very much focused and directed and incented toward recurring revenue, which is why we described it as a reverse integration of Stanley Convergent Security into HSM. What we -- so simply said, we've seen the Niscayah model before, good business, too much installation, not enough recurring. We know what to do with that. And, oh, by the way, we have a history with security acquisitions of improving margins up 400 to 1,000 basis points within 2 to 3 years. That's what's in our model for Niscayah. And to Jim's point, we've seen absolutely nothing having worked with this business now for about 6 months and owned it for 4, that would let us -- that would want us -- lead us to back off from that...
James M. Loree: And there's some hidden benefits as well because -- and I mentioned this before, that the Niscayah people happen to be very good at recurring service revenue, in other words maintenance, scheduled maintenance, prepaid maintenance, those types of things, service contracts for equipment that we frankly in HSM had not really pursued too aggressively. And so we're really learning from that and that's going to be something that's implemented in the U.S. and in the non-HSM or non -- excuse me, Niscayah parts of the Legacy Stanley Security, and I think we'll benefit from that. That's not included in any synergies or anything like that. And then the other thing is the vertical marketing prowess. And Niscayah clearly is -- was better and is better than we were at that, and we've been trying for years to figure that out, and I think they bring excellent talent in that area and experience. And that's something that we will also leverage into our legacy Stanley Electronic Security markets.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, particularly in the financial services vertical as Jim's referring, as you know, Stanley has done -- historically done very well in retail and some other verticals. Niscayah is equally strong in the financial services sector and brings to Jim's point, and we'll leave it at that, really strong vertical marketing capabilities, strategy execution. It was a real plus of the folks that we've inherited both in the U.S. and in Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Two quick questions. First off, you mentioned in the summary that the long-term capital allocation strategy remains the same. That said, which would suggest that more than half of your free cash flow would go to acquisitions. You have a low valuation, you're asking for more productivity with your organization now with the restructuring. Your cash is tied up in Europe, but Europe is going into a recession and things are slowing down. All of that would argue that you would be a little more reticent perhaps, with making acquisitions on a go-forward basis. Is that the case or is it still full steam ahead?
John F. Lundgren: We're -- we look at each and every acquisition, first, on its strategic value and benefit, and second, on its ability to meet or exceed our financial hurdles. And we very, very carefully internally and if it's a large acquisition with our board, evaluate that relative to returning cash to shareholders. So in that regard, our process hasn't changed. If what you predict is correct, it will make it harder to achieve our hurdles, and it would mean there's a greater opportunity to return cash to shareholders, if valuation's low or we think unfairly low via repurchase, as we did $350 million worth in 2011. If we think valuation's somewhat fair, but in a 1% return environment for the next year or 2, which based on what the Federal Reserve announced this morning seems to be the case, then there's probably more potential for an increased dividend in terms of improving the total shareholder return for our investors. So the strategy's the same, Sam, and we will obviously respond to conditions in the marketplace and allocate our capital. And as you know well, it's not year-in, year-out, it is over time. And if you look back in history, it's been roughly 50-50, even though we have a stated objective, 2/3 of our capital allocation going to acquisitions. It's been about 50-50 and it's because we, as I say, evaluate every acquisition relative to share repurchase or relative to a meaningful change in the dividend.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And my last question. Obviously, restructuring's going to occur all over building, products, land. But after having covered you guys for a long time, that you've got a consistent history of what we'll call proactive restructuring. John, does this make it ultimately more difficult to attract incremental top talent at the middle-management levels if the company has a reputation of being hypersensitive with employment levels related to business conditions?
John F. Lundgren: Would it -- I guess, I couldn't be more on the other side of that spectrum. It -- this is -- you've followed Stanley longer than I've been here, which is 8 years. This is -- it is so much easier for our senior HR staff and our business leaders to do their job because we are now a $10 billion company that 6 years ago or 7 years -- 6 years ago was a $2.5 billion company. There is tremendous growth opportunity. Jeff Ansell would cite the statistics and he has publicly at the last investor meeting, he's promoted 200 people internally. So simply said, the talent -- we've been a magnet for talent of late, what it's not a good place to be is if you'd like to just punch the clock, maintain the status quo and have your secretary water you everyday and collect the large paycheck, this probably isn't where you want to come to work, but that's not the kind of talent you're referring to, or that we want to retain. So I just couldn't be in a more different place. We're -- we really have -- the success and the size of the Black & Decker merger combined with the growth rate, Sam, has actually made it a lot easier to attract talent. And I'm not saying it's easy because there's tremendous competition for talent all over the world, particularly in emerging markets. But we have people seeking us out, as opposed to us having to pound the streets for talent. So it's actually gone in the other direction. Fair question, but the impact has been exactly the opposite of what you might be concerned about.
Operator: The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: Jim, thanks for the color a few months ago on the CDIY category, but you'd referenced the promotional activity there. And I was just wondering if it was seasonal and it's now over, or whether it's carrying into the first quarter?
James M. Loree: Well there's always going to promotional activity in CDIY. It tends to be -- peak around Father's Day and then, peak once again around the holidays, at the latter part of the year. So and then, it typically hits the tailwind of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter. I would expect a very similar promotional calendar for this year. I think it's quite possible that I think we'll be looking for better, even better returns on the promotions this year and maybe a little tighter, but probably the same amount of activity.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, and then you mentioned you were driving for volume, is that just part of your ongoing pursuit of growth this year? Or was there something specific going on there that would...
James M. Loree: Well, the company before we -- before it became part of Stanley, it lost a fair amount of market share in the lithium-ion area in particular. And so we are definitely regaining share in lithium-ion and while we're not aggressively promoting because the product's really -- the price value proposition speaks for itself, that's where we really look to be gaining share, and as we look at the NiCad business, while we're in the NiCad business and will continue to be in it, that will become a smaller part of the power tool business as time goes on, and so when there's promotional activity, it typically revolves around that. And then the other area where we're regaining share in, I'm speaking principally about CDIY right now, and the other area would be in the emerging markets, especially related to revenue synergies where Black & Decker had some really strong infrastructure in the emerging markets in Latin America, the Middle East and we both have kind of subscale infrastructure in Asia. And when you put that together, it's pretty strong. So we now have excellent infrastructure. We have great brands that we can leverage across into these markets across what the legacy business is, and I'd say we're really making some great progress in that respect, gaining share.
John F. Lundgren: And David, just one more point on promotion, because -- so you don't get cut off. We pride ourselves on being a learning organization. And again, I referenced that our CDIY team, as you would expect, analyzes every promotion that they conduct, whether it's in Consumer Power Tools or to a lesser extent, they do the same amount of analysis, less promotion, in Professional Power Tools. And we did -- you got a lot of learning late in the year as the team drove to recapture some lost share on which promotions were effective and which weren't, both in terms of which generated enough incremental volume to make it, if it was a price discount or something else that was offered to make it a good business decision versus bad. With every promotion we run, we learn. And I think it's continuous improvement. We'll do a better job every year, while to Jim's point, the level of promotion will be above -- will be about the same, the effectiveness of that promotion, if we can continue to perform the way we have in the past will be improved every year.
Operator: Our last question comes from Peter Lisnic of Robert W. Baird.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I guess, the -- to continue on the CDIY margin question, I understand that clearing out some of the old products and the promotional environment, just wondering if you're seeing any sort of structural change when you look at new product introductions and the margins that you're getting there, has the competitive landscape changed? Does it alter how you think about CDIY going forward from a margin potential perspective?
James M. Loree: No, not at all. I think the new products -- I think they've done such a phenomenal job with the design, particularly of the lithium-ion, I think you're going to see -- if you look at those margins, they're at -- they're at very acceptable levels and will continue to be so for a long time. It's in Power tools is different than Hand Tools, so we can -- we all understand that, but I think we're managing it pretty effectively and to be able to achieve overall margins in the 13% range for the year, for CDIY, and to have more rapid -- more cost synergies coming in next year and the expectation that we will get some accretion in the rate next year, meaning this year is a -- I think it's reasonable. I mean, there is a certain limitation to that over time, and we've not reached that yet, but I think there is a point where in the power tool market in particular, it just becomes difficult to -- there's a feeling to surpass that ceiling. But I don't think that ceiling is at 12% or 13%.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That's actually a good lead-in to my final question, which is, if I'm doing the math right, your op margin guidance basically is about 15% for 2012, which is sort of been a longer-term target, so not to put the proverbial cart before the horse, but how much upside do we have if we actually get better volume and not necessarily just for 2012, but as you kind of look out 3 to 5 years with a better construction environment?
Donald Allan: Peter, you're right about the 15%. I mean, clearly the cost actions above and beyond the synergies adds almost 1.5 to our operating margin rates from 2011 levels. There are negatives against that as I walk-through, but for us to achieve that range at these volume numbers, you are looking at that level of operating margin rate. To your second part of your question around if we performed higher volume levels, I mean we typically indicated that our leverage affect or contribution margin is somewhere, for Legacy Stanley, around 40%, for Black & Decker it was in the low 30s. I think for the new company, it's probably somewhere between 36% and 38%, and that's probably the best way for you to look at it.
Operator: We have no further question at this time. I will now turn the call over to Kate Vanek for closing remarks.
Kathryn H. White Vanek: Thank you so much for tuning in today. Please contact me if you have any questions.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Q3 2011 Stanley Black & Decker Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kim, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Kate White Vanek, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. White Vanek, you may begin.
Kate White Vanek: Thanks so much, Kim. Good morning, everybody, and thank you, all, for joining us for the Stanley Black & Decker's Third Quarter 2011 Conference Call. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, President and CEO; Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, which was issued yesterday after the close and a supplemental presentation, which we will certainly refer to during the call are on the Investor Relations portion of our website, stanleyblackanddecker.com. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's third quarter results and various other topical matters, followed by a Q&A session. There is some helpful information in the appendix of the slide deck as it relates to your models. If you have questions, please contact me directly after the call.  In addition, you'll note on the cover of our PowerPoint presentation for this quarter, you'll see a barcode on the cover. You can access our DEWALT Hand Tools mobile site by downloading the free scan app available on your App Store, and you'll be able to access the site by clicking on the code from there. A replay of the call will be available beginning at 2:00 today. Replay number and access code are on the release. And as always, you can download the earnings replay as a podcast from iTunes as well, should you be interested.  We will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risks and uncertainties. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. And we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K, which we filed with the press release and in our most recent '34 Act. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everyone. If we could focus on the first slide, I think the greatest highlight of the third quarter '11 is in the earnings number itself, which excluding merger-related charges, increased almost 40% versus the prior year. Revenues were up 11%, $2.6 billion, organically up 4% in what you'll hear is a relatively soft market. By segment, CDIY grew 5% organically, excluding Pfister and previously announced divestitures such as the Delta business. Within CDIY, our Professional Power Tools sales rose over 20% on the strengths of some very exciting and very well-received new product introductions that Jim is going to talk to you a little bit about in the segment analysis. 10% organic growth in our Industrial segment. We're seeing great strength there, both in IAR, as well as some of our Infrastructure segments. Security was flat versus prior year. There are a lot of puts and calls within Security in general and within the Mechanical Access portion of Security in particular. But despite the flat volume, our margins as you'll see in a second, were very strong in Security.  Dilutive GAAP earnings were $0.92 a share, $1.34 excluding the M&A-related charges, and repeat that, that is plus 38% versus third quarter 2010. 13.9% operating margin. That excludes Niscayah, which is included for about 3.5 weeks in our results. That's up 130 basis points from the same period a year ago. Strong margins in Security as I have suggested earlier, 20.2%. And that was within Security, our Convergent Security Solutions business posted record profitability.  SFS continues to be embraced. And as a consequence, working capital turns increased 24% to 5.7. Again, excluding Niscayah, which was only part of the company for 3 weeks in September. As Don will point out in our outlook and as he looks at our balance sheet and cash flow, working capital turns and the improvement in turns and many other things as a result of the embedding of the Stanley Fulfillment System across the larger company, is a tremendous ongoing source of cash.  Niscayah closed on September 9. We've made really good progress in the first 5 weeks. And per our announcement, and I'll talk about it a little bit later, we're expecting $0.20 of accretion next year, $80 million in synergies by 2013, resulting in even further accretion. $350 million share repurchase took place during the third quarter, and that's about $100 million more than we previously communicated. We bought in a total of 5.6 million shares. So the earnings was driven by a lot of things: healthy organic growth relative to the market and cost synergies from the ongoing success of the Black & Decker integration.  We've had a lot of conversation on various geographies, and it is a mixed bag around the world, but generally positive as this chart will show. Organic revenues, as I mentioned, were up 4%. But if we start on the middle left in our largest market, plus 3% in the U.S. That represents more than 55% of Stanley Black & Decker's total revenue. Canada was flat, represents 7% of our total revenue. And Europe, our second largest market, was plus 3%, again with very strong performance in the Industrial segment, relative softness in CDIY, but healthy performance nonetheless relative to the market and some good, relatively good early results in Security from a margin perspective and relatively flat from a volume perspective.  Looking at Latin America. Our revenue synergies are really beginning to gain traction in Latin America. It represents 9% of our combined revenues and we had 23% organic growth in Latin America during the third quarter. Asia grew 9% organically and is becoming an increasingly large part of our portfolio. But if you see the bubble that we've highlighted, if you exclude Engineered Fastening, our Emhart business, organic sales growth in Asia was 19%, a tremendous achievement, not dissimilar to Latin America.  Engineered Fastening grew sequentially. It had a very good quarter, but it's still feeling the aftereffect of the second quarter tragedies in Japan that had a tremendous effect on the automotive industry, coming back nicely but still not back to pre-tsunami and earthquake levels. And last and arguably least, representing 1% of our volume, organic sales were down 8% in Australia. We think that's a quarterly aberration rather than an ongoing trend. Australia remains a very important market for us despite its small size. So Europe is steady and emerging markets, Asia, Latin America, continuing to expand at a tremendous rate.  Looking at the sources of growth. As I suggested earlier, Professional Power Tools and the Industrial business posted really, really strong organic growth, despite relatively subdued end markets. Volume, 4%, as I've said. Price was flat. Jim and Don will come onto that a little bit. We had some positive list price increases and some greater-than-expected promotional activity on some of our older-generation products to enhance and help the sell-through. But all-in, flat price during the quarter, with organic volume up 4%. Currency helped us, 3%, and the impact of acquisitions, 4%, for your total top line growth of 11%.  If you're looking within the businesses, Professional Power Tools & Accessories, 17%; industrial, 10%; Security, excluding the automatic door business, or Stanley Access Technologies, was plus 2%; Consumer Power Tools were flat; Hand Tools and Fasteners, most of which is the legacy Stanley Hand Tool business, was down 6% with relative softness in the U.S. and Europe and strong strength everywhere else. Access Technologies, as Jim will talk about in the segments, our automatic door business down 9%. It's rare for them to have a down quarter. Some retrofit business with large customers was delayed. The business remains very strong. And Pfister down 22%, not dissimilar to last quarter as that reflects the impact of lost SKUs at a major customer that's been in place since the first of the year. And we'll have one more quarter of that type of comparison before we've reach, if you will, steady state on the Pfister business. So it gives you a little more granularity inside the segment. And Jim will give you some of the cause and effects in just a minute.  Finally, integration, first and foremost on many of our minds, certainly mine, in the senior management team. I'll talk about 2 different programs running in parallel. First, the Black & Decker integration within Stanley to become one company remains on track. We're projected to achieve $450 million in cost synergies by 2013 and enter 2014 at a $485 million annualized basis. We're getting into the major project implementation phase. We've consolidated 2 major distribution centers, 3 plants, they are progress on time and on budget. We're tracking these very, very closely because the interdependency of these projects and the resulting increased complexity is very, very important and it's as important as ever that we stay on top of these. We are as part of our, I'd say, rigorous and, I think, well understood integration process. Senior management and the relevant project managers meet regularly with our normal dashboard format to ensure that these programs stay on track.  We have $115 million in incremental cost synergies this year. That's going to drive about $0.50 in earnings accretion. And something that we're very excited about is our revenue synergy projects. They're beginning to yield strong results. They're still on track for $300 million to $400 million in incremental revenue and $0.35 to $0.50 EPS accretion by the end of 2013. The biggest opportunities, it's already showing up in the numbers, are in CDIY and IAR in Latin America, both Argentina and Brazil, and it's really encouraging to see these results. Niscayah, as I mentioned, closed on September 9. It was a publicly traded company. The first 4, now 5 weeks of the integration, confirmed our ability to achieve the stated cost synergies of $80 million. It's more than just a European business. I think it's important to understand there is overlap in the U.S., about 15% of Niscayah's business is in the U.S. and about 15% of the legacy Stanley Convergent Security business was in the U.K. and France. So there's really good opportunity in those 3 geographies, as well as an opportunity to drive some synergies through improved practices across the rest of the system.  The management team is in place. Massimo Grassi, one of our most senior executives in Europe, has been named to head Security Europe. He brings global experience and a lot of experience managing cross cultures, cross integrations. We very much like what we found with Niscayah. Tremendous field organization, quite decentralized relative to the Stanley model. We will get everything that can be done in one place done in one place, and Massimo has been overseeing that for about 4 years with our company. And anything that touches a customer and end user will continue to be done locally because that's the way we do it in Europe. That's our model for success and we're quite encouraged by the prospects for Niscayah 5 to 6 weeks into it. The pro forma financial impact is, per our information release, we're expecting $45 million of cost synergies and $0.20 accretion next year, another $35 million in the following year, which will ultimately result in $0.45 of accretion. Both the incremental accretion from Black & Decker and next year's accretion from Niscayah are included in the 2012 preliminary outlook that Don provided. But let me turn it over to Jim to give you some more granularity on our 3 reporting segments for the third quarter and going forward.
James M. Loree: Okay, thank you, John. In light of the continued difficult global construction market, CDIY delivered a very solid performance. Total sales were $1.338 billion, up 6% from the third quarter '10. Segment profit of $170 million was also up 6% and the profit rate held nicely in the 13% range.  Organic sales were plus 3% but up 5%, as John said, excluding Pfister and the divestitures. And the Professional Power Tools & Accessories business was overwhelmingly positive with 17% organic growth on the strength of its lithium-ion share gains, as well as increased promotional activity on older-generation power tool products. Consumer Power Tools was flat organically with a weak backdrop in the U.S. and Europe, offsetting double-digit gains in Asia and Latin America, and Hand Tools and Fastening was down 6%, of which 2 points of that erosion was due to a business model change with the Bostitch industrial business, which shifted over from a direct to a distributor model. But broad POS pressure in the U.S. and Europe was really at the core here. And it more than offset DEWALT Hand Tools share gains, listing gains and strong emerging market -- and a strong emerging market performance.  As you can see, CDIY revenues in Latin America grew 19%, with above-average operating margin rates. But the highlight really was in Professional Power Tools, which grew over 20% due to the success of the 18- and 20-volt Max lithium-ion line and continued strength from the 12v lithium-ion line that was introduced a year ago. And Power Tool Accessories were strong as well, up 6%, which is a continued focus for us to grow that highly profitable recurring abrasives and accessories line.  Let's talk about pricing. And I know that's on a lot of people's minds. But pricing actions were successful in CDIY during the quarter. We locked in the final increases that were out there hanging, and we now have successfully achieved our goals in terms of list price increases to offset inflation. But during the quarter, we chose to offset the benefit from that with higher promotional discounts on NiCad and other older-generation products. And you can understand with limited store traffic and increasing dichotomy between the pros who simply want the best power tool out there, i.e. our new lithium-ion, and those who are more interested in good performance at a lower price point, we felt that this was the best gambit available to us to affect the phase in, phase out and maximize revenue and profit. And we think it did.  So all in all, a decent showing for CDIY. Revenue growth, profit growth and share gain all against a tough market backdrop. Security also had strong profit growth in a weak environment. Total sales were $656 million, up 17%, with acquisitions contributing 15 of the 17 points. Organic sales growth was flat. Segment profit was $110 million, up a very strong 26%, a nice operating leverage. And synergies from the Black & Decker and other acquisitions, price and productivity more than offsetting inflation, and ex acquisition charges, the segment profit rate was 18.4% and ex the temporary margin dilution from the new acquisitions, Security OM percent was actually 20.2%, certainly a very good place for that to be and we haven't seen that in a long, long time.  As the businesses went, CSS or Convergent Security, was up 1%, with 4% growth in RMR, recurring revenue, monthly revenue, and install volume was down 2%. But healthy order flow from both national accounts and core commercial accounts left us with an increasing backlog and orders were up 10% in the U.S., U.K. during the quarter and up 4% overall in this subsegment. Also notable, CSS France, the home of the ADT France acquisition, which we made a year ago, really progressed quite smoothly and now we've gotten that operating margin rate into the mid-teens as we promised and are now ready to digest the Niscayah activities as well in France. So that's definitely another highlight. And then in addition, a business that we will be featuring in the future as a growth engine in the coming years, Healthcare Solutions was up 12% organically, indicating some of the power and potential of that unit due to strong sales in both patient security and RFID-enabled storage systems.  Turning to Mechanical. Excluding the Access business, organic growth was up 2%, which we think was an excellent performance, given the very difficult market conditions, especially in residential that we and our competitors have been encountering. The story there was clearly share gain, specifically Kwikset, which comported itself quite well at retail during the quarter. Now turning to Access. John mentioned down 9%, continued to fight market headwinds. In this case, Access does have some significant customer concentration and its largest customer elected to delay remodels during the quarter. The rest of the business was quite healthy. But that delay with that large customer resulted in a 9% overall decrease, so we expect that to be a temporary phenomenon. They also maintained their strong profitability, right around 20% operating margin in Access despite that setback.  And overall, Mechanical Access operating margin percent was greater than 19%, with 300 basis points of year-over-year expansion, reflecting synergy realization, strong productivity and successful pricing actions. So for 4Q, you can expect another solid quarter for Security, with 3% to 4% organic growth, we think, characterized by very strong Electronic Security and continued market headwinds for MAS and Access. Niscayah will also be accretive to OM dollars but certainly not to the rate.  Turning to Industrial. Once again, Industrial had a great quarter. Revenues were up $642 million, up 19% over the third quarter. Segment profit was $106 million, up 31% and the operating margin rate expanded to 16.5%. All 3 of the subsegments had healthy organic growth during the quarter, leading to a 10% organic growth performance for Industrial overall. IAR was up 6% organically as industrial and mobile distribution, as well as Engineered Storage benefited from strong customer demand and market share gains. And for the old-time Mac aficionados, Mac had its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and is operating at record operating margin rate levels as we go. Solid revenue growth for the entire North American segment of Industrial & Automotive Repair, it was up 12% organically. And in emerging market, volume was up 20%, more than offsetting a modestly softer Europe.  New products, particularly in the mid-price point range, as the market has shifted slightly, gained traction globally with strong results in emerging markets and the operating margin rate expanded 350 basis points, driven by operating leverage cost synergies and successful price inflation recovery. Engineered Fastening had a terrific showing, with organic revenues up 14%, 3x the growth in global light vehicle production, as new products such as the T-Series Stud Welding, which debuted at Volkswagen during the quarter, and increased platform and penetration market share gains, and as John mentioned, production in Japan rebounded sequentially as we expected. And that is now on the road to recovery, well on the road to recovery.  Infrastructure was the star of the quarter in terms of organic growth, up 19% in the segment and pro forma revenues for CRC were up in the mid-single-digits on stronger international product sales. And operating margin rate for that acquisition topped 18%. Hydraulic sales were up 30% on continued market strength in that small but very, very successful business. On balance, another strong quarter for Industrial, really complementing the other units and helping us drive a pretty good performance for the total company.  Now as we move to working capital. On working capital, we made excellent progress during the quarter and we have started the multiyear trek to drive legacy Black & Decker to 8 to 9 turns, thus enabling us to extract, over time, a $0.5 billion of cash from unproductive assets. This quarter, the highlights were accounts receivable and accounts payable. And as you can see, accounts receivable drove $96 million of cash vis-à-vis the prior year. That was in the face of 11% sales growth. So very difficult to do, but that obviously was a very nice improvement in days. Payables drove $118 million of cash flow versus the prior year and took its days from 60 to 74, a 14-day increase.  Inventories, on the other hand, I would look for a significant inventory turns increase in the fourth quarter. Inventory takes a little bit longer when you make the process improvements to get the results. But from where I sit, I can see excellent progress in the business units across the company. We have solid plans in place to affect this improvement in the fourth quarter. I think that's going to go a long ways towards contributing to the $1.1 billion of cash flow that we expect to drive this year. Working capital through SFS is a momentum gain and we are gaining momentum. So more to come and stay tuned. Now I'll turn it over to Don Allan, who'll take you through the financial aspects.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. So we start on Page 12. I'd like to spend a little bit of time talking about our free cash flow performance. As a reminder, this does exclude M&A charges, the numbers on the page. Specifically, if we start with working capital, as Jim mentioned on the previous page, we had a very nice performance year-over-year. But sequentially, we had a little bit of a retraction of working capital, which is why you see a $45 million negative. Very much a seasonality phenomena, where we tend to see a great deal of our working capital benefit occur in the fourth quarter, of both legacy companies for Stanley and Black & Decker. And so throughout the year, we've had a slight negative performance in working capital, as you see $121 million. We would expect that to turn positive in the fourth quarter, closer to $100 million and $150 million of a positive. That will drive a lot of the strong cash flow performance that we'll see next quarter and will allow us to feel that we've achieved our $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year.  A couple of other items of note on the page. If you look at other large negative in there, and we talked about this throughout the year, as I mentioned in the July earnings call, we had a significant tax settlement in the first and the second quarter that was noncash of about $70 million. We also have a large pension payment that's occurring throughout the year, which will be about $80 million by the end of the year, $60 million through 3 quarters. And then a few other items that make up that $233 million of a negative. Even with that though, we feel that we'll be able to achieve our $1.1 billion free cash flow by the end of the year.  Another item of note is CapEx. In line with our projections, it's about 2.1% of revenue. And this will be CapEx excluding any M&A-related capital activities. But it's on track for our expectations. So why would we feel comfortable that we can achieve $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the year? Well, one of the big items is what I've mentioned, working capital will swing to a positive of about $100 million to $150 million for the full year after the fourth quarter has been completed. And that's really due to the phenomena of seasonality, as well as the SFS activities that Jim was describing on the previous page. Additionally, if you look at history of the 2 legacy companies over the past 2 years, anywhere from 50% to 60% of the free cash flow is achieved in the fourth quarter. If you utilize both types of analytical statistics it gets you to $1 billion, $1.1 billion of a projection for the year, hence why we feel comfortable that we can achieve the free cash flow performance by the end of 2011.  Moving to the next page, spending a little bit of time on 2011 outlook. The first item I want to talk about is net organic sales. Our current projection for the year is 3.5% organic sales, which is down from the 4% to 5% we provided in July. I'll remind everyone that our guidance throughout the year has really been predicated on very little market growth in the mature markets in Europe and in the United States. But what we have seen in the third quarter, and we expect to continue in the fourth quarter, is a bit of a retraction in the U.S. hand tool volumes, as Jim discussed, on the segment slides earlier. We would imagine that likely will continue in the fourth quarter. We're also seeing modest softness in Europe. We discussed softness in CDIY back in July. We're also seeing a little bit of softness in our Industrial & Automotive Repair tool business and a flat performance in our Security business in Europe. Offsetting that is a great performance in our Engineered Fastening business, as both John and Jim had discussed earlier this morning. But we'd expect those trends to continue. Hence, why we believe we'll have a lower organic growth performance in revenue this year. What that means to EPS is that we still believe we'll be able to achieve our EPS range, where we communicated in July a range of $5.15 to $5.40, although we would be at the lower end of the range and the Q4 EPS will be $1.30.  A few items embedded in our forecast for the year. They're more nonoperational in nature, as you can see on the last bullet on the left-hand side of this page. We certainly did a buyback of $350 million or 5.6 million shares, which drove our share count down and our average for the year will now be approximately $167 million versus $170 million we communicated in July. The tax benefits that we had in the third quarter, where our tax rate was around 20%, in the third quarter, we would expect this for the year, the tax rate will be between 17% and 18%. So lower than we communicated in July. So those 2 items together, about an $0.18 EPS positive for the entire year. Offsetting that, though, is what's been happening with foreign currency, and we see a significant decline in the euro versus the dollar. Primarily that's the main driver. And that's having a negative impact of $0.13 cents on our forecast as well. So the net impact of that is about a $0.05 positive on the outlook for 2011.  Moving to the right side of the page, we believe the total revenue growth performance will be about 12.5%. I mentioned the organic piece of 3.5% and then we believe acquisitions, which a large part of that will be Niscayah as well as currency, will add an additional 9% for the year. And then a little bit of housekeeping related to interest, other net and restructuring. We still expect that to be approximately $330 million as we're definitely having lower non-M&A restructuring this year. However, we have higher amortization that's coming from Niscayah that pretty much offsets that, so a net mutual versus what we were seeing in July.  We're reiterating a few items. We expect $200 million in cost synergies in 2011. We believe that even with the promotional discounting that Jim described around pricing, we still will achieve price inflation recovery of between 33% and 50%, closer to the bottom end of that range. And then our free cash flow, I mentioned earlier, of $1.1 billion being achieved. So we're still achieving our lower end of our guidance range that we started with earlier in the year, despite very turbulent market conditions and a few unforeseen headwinds.  So looking ahead to 2012. We thought it was important to give various folks some insight into what are thoughts were related to 2012. If we assume economic conditions remain as is, so we have a little bit of softness in parts of Europe and in some of the U.S. hand tool markets, we have strength in some of our Industrial businesses, expecting modest growth in Security, et cetera, we believe $6 EPS for 2012 appears achievable, and here's why. If you start with 2011 as a base, if you're utilizing the $1.30 guidance I just provided for the fourth quarter and adding that to our year-to-date EPS performance of $3.89, gets you to a $5.19 EPS for 2011. John mentioned that we have $115 million of cost synergies related to Black & Decker in 2012, which is about $0.50 EPS earnings accretion. We also have the Niscayah transaction that John discussed. That will be $0.20 accretion in 2012. So those are 2 items that we can execute upon and perform, which will drive accretion of a significant nature. Additionally, if we just take an assumption around volume and revenue synergies that will have a consistent performance to what we've seen this year, which is in essence driving growth in emerging markets, both market growth and revenue synergy base, gaining market share, as well as a relatively flat performance in the mature markets of Europe and the United States, you could see that we would have a relatively consistent performance with 2011.  Offsetting those 3 positives will be a tax kind of clawback, where we had a 17.5% tax rate in 2011. I would imagine that would return back into the 20s for 2012. That will be a bit of a negative as we walk to 2012 $6 EPS. A few items that are not shown here that offset each other would be general productivity as we drive productivity through our supply chain. That will be a positive. But we will have a bit of an overhang, especially in the first and part of the second quarter of inflation versus price that will carry over into next year. And then if currency rates stay where they are today, we will have a bit of a negative drag from FX. Those 3 items will offset each other at this point in time, which is why we feel comfortable that the $6 is achievable.  So to summarize the call this morning, the integrations of both Black & Decker and Niscayah are progressing very well. We're comfortable with the Niscayah leadership and the integration teams are in place. As Jim and John touched on the market share gains, they're very evident across all 3 of our segments. Professional Power Tools are up 20% despite no increase in housing starts. The Engineered Fastening business, up 14%, which is approximately 3x global light vehicle production around the world. Our Security hardware business, up 10%, in a declining market. The ongoing global company-wide SFS implementation is definitely gaining traction. You saw the numbers that Jim presented. Working capital turns have increased 24% versus the prior year. It's really demonstrating the organizational agility and the effectiveness of integrating Black & Decker and assimilating them into the Stanley Fulfillment System. This powerful accretion from both cost and revenue synergies that have existed in 2011, that will carry over into 2012, which is why we believe we can drive an EPS performance of $6. With that, we'll open it up to Q&A.
Kate White Vanek: Great. Kim, we'd like to open up and begin our Q&A. As always, we're going to follow the one question, one follow-up model going forward.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have a question from Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just wondering if you -- you talked a lot about the thoughts going to the $6 earnings for 2012. Can you give any sort of quick thoughts in terms of your cash flow and thought on what you can do to SFS next year for cash flow generation but also thinking about any potential contributions to the pension?
Donald Allan: Yes, Dan, it's Don. I would say that the pension -- just to deal with that last part, the pension contribution will be consistent with 2011, so there wouldn't be any significant increase there. As far as the free cash flow performance, we do believe we will exceed $1.1 billion next year as well, and we will have a nice working capital performance embedded in that. And I would imagine you'd see working capital turns improve about 0.5 turn in 2012 versus 2011.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then also, I guess, the follow-up would be just really into hand tools in terms of the promotional activity, in terms of pricing there. As you look forward to the coming year, assuming sort of a challenging environment here, are you assuming that there is continued pressure in terms of pricing and margins in that area?
James M. Loree: Yes, this is Jim. The way we constructed the promotional activity, it was essentially a one-quarter phenomenon. Now we also have some promotional activity in the fourth quarter. This time, it will be in the Consumer Power Tools business and much more so than the Professional as you get into the seasonal aspects of Consumer Power Tools and the gifts and so forth, that tends to be more in their fairway. Beyond that, it really remains to be seen what happens with the competitive backdrop in terms of pricing. All our competitors have, like we have, faced significant price inflation. We raised our prices, they didn't for the most part. So we're going to be just kind of stepping back and observing, and we'll see what happens with respect to that and we will do what we have to do to maximize our share and our profitability.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Lucas from Janney Capital Markets.
James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: First question, regarding the M&A pipeline. With Niscayah now closed and the share repurchase largely completed this year, could you talk a little bit about the appetite for deals as well as what you're seeing in the pipeline these days?
John F. Lundgren: Sure, Jim, this is John. We always have an appetite, as those who follow the company know, because historically, between 50% and 2/3 of our free cash has gone to acquisitions. That being said, those who follow us will also know we're very disciplined in terms of our credit rating, financial hurdles for acquisitions and our organizational capacity, all of which will come into play. Our 5 strategic growth platforms remain the same. We've been pretty public with what they are: Convergent, Mechanical, Security, Engineered Fastening, Healthcare and Infrastructure. There is a good pipeline. I think the important thing to know is the majority of that pipeline is outside the U.S., number one, and in very high-growth emerging markets, number two. But 2 things importantly there, those do take longer to incubate, many are private companies and we need to be quite comfortable that we have both the financial and organizational capacity with the cash we generate, as well as with the people we can put on the field before we pursue one. So our strategy remains the same. Our financial discipline remains the same. Organizational capacity remains a discipline. The focus is on those 5 areas. And from a geographic perspective, it's in very high-growth markets. And I guess, I'd go so far to say it won't be in the first half of the year where you see something game-changing and that we don't feel that we have either the organizational or financial capacity to do that.
James M. Loree: Yes. And I would just like to follow up, and this is Jim, to say that as we look at an acquisition at this point in time, we're looking at trading that up against a share repurchase. And as you saw in the quarter, we bought $100 million more than we had previously planned because of the opportunistic price that we felt was on the table. And we will continue to make that evaluation on an ongoing basis. When you're trading for 6x EBITDA, it's hard to get your head around paying 11x or 12x or 10x or 9x even for something, unless the synergies are so rich that after the implementation, you get to a point where you're at or near the market multiple of the company. So it's a tougher decision. It's a more thoughtful decision right now as it relates to whether we buy our own stock or whether we buy another company. Now in this case of international acquisitions, as John mentioned, that will probably be our focus. The pipeline is certainly strong there and the obvious benefit from that strategically is there. But you also have the opportunity to use international cash that otherwise could not be deployed in favor of share repurchase. So it's the U.S. acquisitions that really get the tough scrutiny as to whether we should do them or not in the face of what I just described.
James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay, very helpful. And as a follow-up, you gave us some color on the initial revenue synergies that you've captured using Latin America as an example. Could you talk a little bit more about some of the early successes of any standout, as well as you're looking at it, are others beginning to emerge that you didn't identify initially?
John F. Lundgren: Sure. I'll take it, and Jim should feel free to follow up. Couple 3 that are in the marketplace, so we're quite comfortable talking about it. I'll start with Latin America first. The fact that we're producing and selling Stanley-branded Hand Tools in Uberaba. That's our plant in Brazil, our legacy BDK plant, with a tremendous adjacent distribution center, where historically Stanley ran a very high-priced import model. It was subject to 18% plus tariff. So Stanley Hand Tools produced in Latin America, sold in Latin America through a well-established Black & Decker distribution channel, jumps right out as probably the biggest one, Jim. The second one bring to mind is things like DEWALT Hand Tools at a large domestic customer, which of course could not have been done under the previous regime. DEWALT is an incredibly powerful brand name, but Black & Decker didn't have the capability to produce or source hand tools that would merit the quality and performance that would merit the DEWALT name or they would've done that on their own a long time ago. That's the second example. Third, just in distribution. Jim mentioned the Mac aficionados. I think most people on the phone understand how the Mac model works. They're essentially franchisees. And while they drive Mac trucks, everything on their truck isn't Mac. The fact that a Mac distributor has DEWALT power tools on his truck, you can only imagine the competitive advantage that gives them and the opportunity that is for the Mac sales folks, which has really helped improve their top line as well as their bottom line. So those are 3 that are in the marketplace, more to come. But we're really pleased with the traction it's gaining and the results that those synergies are generating.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question, if I could just go back to 2012 guidance and the positive impact that you expect from volume and revenue synergies. Obviously, we're still a couple of quarters away, but -- or at least a quarter away rather, but I was wondering if you could parse out kind of, of the positive impact, how much incremental -- you've been talking about a 50 bps of positive top line growth from revenue this year, what that might be next year? And of the core volume, let's say, how much from developed markets versus emerging markets?
Donald Allan: Michael, it's Don. I would -- we're certainly not giving specific guidance yet, but to give you a little bit of an indication of our thought process. Certainly, we've seen about 3.5% organic growth in 2011 and about 50 basis points of that is coming from revenue synergies. As we go into 2012, we would expect that the revenue synergy number to increase a little bit from a percentage point as we go into the year, so somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points coming from revenue synergies. Combining that, we do expect emerging markets around the world to grow from a market growth perspective and gaining share, not really duplicating what I'm describing around revenue synergies. So that's going to give us some growth. And then our belief right now is we're going to continue to see some of the softness that we've seen in Europe continue next year. So maybe a little bit of a retraction for the first part of the year and a stabilization and flat performance in the back half. And then the U.S. will be similar, I think, in that regard. What we've seen this year will continue or what we've seen in the back half will continue into next year. So the mature markets, we wouldn't expect much growth, in some cases, a little bit of a retraction. And then a lot of our growth is going to come from emerging markets and revenue synergies. And that's our current thought process.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: That's really helpful. I appreciate it. Second question, if we could just go back to the promotions in the power tools, if you could just kind of give us a sense. You said Professional grew over 20%. How much you might think came from the promotions themselves? And I guess, conceptually speaking, you put through the price increase, yet you also had these promotions. What's your view in terms of the stability of that price increase? And is it just something that, I guess, like you said before, you're going to have to take on a quarter-by-quarter basis?
John F. Lundgren: Sure, Mike, a fair question. I think I fear you misinterpreted Jim's comments. And I'm really glad you asked the question to give us a chance to clarify. Essentially, none of that growth came from promotion. Let me break the power tools. The overwhelming majority of that increase came because we had tremendous sell-through on the 12-volt lithium-ion Max product and tremendous pipeline and sell-in on the really, really well-accepted 18- and 20-volt. That's where the overwhelming majority of the lift came. It's where we got the pricing. And of course, we have to announce pricing -- not have to, but we chose to announce pricing across the entire Professional Power Tool line and sell-in and sell-through of those at higher prices was terrific. The promotion that we talked about, recall that's still a very large part of our franchises in the older nickel cadmium technology. And the point Jim made is a very important one. It's a high-performing product, but the reason lithium-ion is growing so much is the charge lasts longer and it is greener. It's also a lot more expensive. So there are folks who are looking at good performance for a good price, who want the NiCad but we're required to promote it more heavily than the lithium-ion product. And then the last point that Jim raised, remember the Black & Decker brand, which is very powerful, is less focused at the professional user as opposed to the DIYer, and it's also a very, very important gift item. It's one of the few brands and products in our line that has any seasonality at all. They are very popular Christmas gifts for dad, for granddad, for the child with a new apartment or a new home. And so there is some fourth quarter seasonality historically promoting of the Black & Decker Consumer Power Tool brand. Having said all that, we will maintain or continue to grow share. We will not be at a price disadvantage or premium to our competitors. We are the market leader and as a consequence, behave like the price leader. And if we're out there alone, we'll promote to get back to competitive market prices. And if we're not, we will continue to gain share at higher prices. And I think that's the best guidance we can provide you. We look at this daily, not quarter-to-quarter or in the rearview mirror. I think, so you don't get cut off, another very important point to make, we've talked about this on previous calls, our pricing center of excellence works very closely with our global sourcing organization to see inflationary increases long before they show up in product costs, so our SBU managers know they're coming, can either reengineer or condition the sales force for the need to take a price increase, so we get out ahead of it. The result, at the end of the day, we're in an industry where historically, real prices have declined 1% to 2% a year for the last 10 years. Gross margins are about 35%. If you didn't somehow, between productivity and price, get 3% a year, your margins would decline. Our margins are not declining. In fact, they're growing. So it suggests a combination of price and productivity has historically and will continue to deliver well above industry average margins. And we think we have the programs and processes in place and look at it closely enough to carry that forward for the next 12 months.
James M. Loree: And If I could just take it to a very tactical level, the impact from the promotions from a revenue perspective in CDIY might have been somewhere between 1% and 2% of sales in the quarter. And our estimation is that the market was probably slightly negative. And so that probably just got us right up to about flat. And anything beyond that was driven by new product introductions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays Capital.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Guys, I was wondering if you could address the issue of inventory destocking. Obviously, as we're looking across the Industrial group, it's something that people -- as we look ahead into the fourth quarter and year end, people are a little concerned that we may see a wave of inventory destocking. Typically, I would think that your product mix isn't going to be particularly susceptible to that. However, we have in the past seen Black & Decker talk about that probably a little bit more than Stanley. So I was curious if you could talk about what you see from your customers in terms of vulnerability to an inventory destocking wave if one were to come.
Donald Allan: Sure, Stephen, it's Don. I'd be happy to talk about that. Obviously, I think as you're aware and many folks are, we are monitoring POS and weeks on stocks on hand on a regular basis. So we get that information for our major customers, and we're always monitoring to make sure that we're not getting ahead of ourselves from an inventory perspective. Right now, where we are, we feel comfortable where inventory levels are. We tend to want them to be somewhere between on average, 10 to 12 weeks of inventory on hand in our major customers. And you may have small pieces that deviate from that range. But overall, if we're in that range, we feel reasonably comfortable with the levels of inventory. Additionally, we're always listening to any signals from our customers as to whether there's change in thought process of levels of inventory that they may want to maintain. At this stage, we're not aware of anything that would cause a concern in that light. Our inventories are at the right level based on the range I provided, as well as we're not hearing any signals from our customers that, that's a particular initiative or set of actions they may be considering or evaluating.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's comforting to hear. Thanks a lot for that. Second question relates to the geographic breakdown that you provided on Page 5, where Latin America was up organic 23%. I was curious as to whether or not you could talk about what the margin profile looks like for your Latin American offering, whether it's generally higher margin or lower margin to your company average.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, we actually put that in the presentation. And we'll say this much, it's a very fair question, and it's an important answer. It is above line average margin. We are not going to get more granular than that on this call for obvious reasons. But when it's growing that fast, a very logical and fair question is: Are you growing volume up at the expense of share and margin? We are really pleased due to a combination of premium products and a very competitive cost position due to a world-class manufacturing facility and a good local management team that the entire business in Latin America is above our line average for each specific segment.
James M. Loree: And we can say the same thing for Asia as well. You grow into Asia, you grow into Latin America, you grow into mix and the higher margin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Most of my questions have been asked and answered. One small one, I guess, that's left for me, CRC-Evans, the margins look terrific, the sales being up only mid-single-digit. I would've thought that, that end market would have been a little bit more robust with pipeline CapEx where it is. I know it's a niche business for you. But what do you ascertain that the market share trends there for CRC? And is the integration perhaps affecting top line execution?
James M. Loree: This is Jim. Certainly, we're very encouraged by what we have purchased. And what I will tell you is that if there's any governor on sales right now with CRC-Evans, it is the onshore business in North America. And the onshore business in North America has been characterized by -- especially at 48-inch pipeline in that segment, which is our sweet spot, has been characterized by bureaucratic, unnecessary delays that are related to environmentalists, government, et cetera. And it's incredibly frustrating. There are all sorts of opportunities, the Keystone Pipeline being the biggest that could really drive tens of millions of dollars of revenue and many jobs for this country. And unfortunately, it's delayed. Now it looks like it might be breaking loose. And if it does, it will be a great market for us. In the meantime, we're not sitting still. We have -- actually, I'd say the integration has helped these folks in terms of their product development strategy because where the action is today is in the less than 48-inch pipeline. We are completely redeveloping products that are suited for that particular market, but that's unfortunately a couple of quarters out before we really get the benefit of that. So the shale and those types of things, it's all going to be a narrow pipeline. So when we get prepared to serve that market, it's also going to be very strong for us. And then finally, the offshore business, which is really the outstanding part of this business that we have made so much progress in over the last year, winning accounts with the 2 major pipeline suppliers in the world on the offshore basis. We have a terrific value proposition with welding, coating, pipe laying, inspection and so forth. We've gained market share. We've had many, many wins around the world, and that will be coming next year in force. It's a $30 million business today. We expect it to be $100 million to $200 million within a couple of years, and next year will be a very significant growth from offshore. So no matter what happens in the onshore business, we're going to get great growth from the offshore. If we can get the products configured to the smaller diameter pipelines and if the government can get off dead center here and get going with the Keystone project and some other major projects, I think we'll be in great shape.
John F. Lundgren: Sam, this is John. So you don't get cut off and you're able to ask a second question, I'll add 2 things. First of all, Jim Loree is not running for public office. He's too valuable as a senior executive at Stanley Black & Decker as much as we think he'd make a wonderful government official. Second, probably equally important point, simply for us, this is a very lumpy business that we're getting used to. You know our business well and in our Industrial platform, about 80% of what we do is made to stock. It comes out of a customer's maintenance budget. It's no less predictable than our CDIY business. Infrastructure, in general, but Hydraulics and CRC in particular, these are generally big numbers, big projects, and quite frankly, depending on when they're executed, when they're completed and when they hit the P&L, if we have $400 million business, it isn't $100 million a quarter. It's $70 million, one quarter and $130 million, the next. And I think it's important that as we look at it, that we understand that. And we're looking at longer-term trends because the orders, they tend to come in much bigger numbers and bigger chunks. And as a consequence, it's just a lumpier business than 80% of what we do.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: The other question is what's the latest plan and update for Pfister at this point?
John F. Lundgren: Yes. Well, it's a business that needs to, like any and all of our businesses, needs to earn its cost of capital to remain a valuable part of our portfolio. And what I'm able to say at this stage, Sam, is it took a tremendous bowshot in the first quarter, lost 20-plus percent of its business. Since then, it's recovered very, very nicely. They've got a very sound strategy in place. We're looking at the business hard to can it, in fact, recover to the levels of profitability and ongoing strategic position that it can remain part of our portfolio. And if not, as you know, we're fairly dispassionate about these things. And if it can't and we make the decision long term that it won't, it will no longer be part of our portfolio. Jury's still out at this stage, but stay tuned and we'll keep you updated.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill: I just wanted to talk about the CDIY margin as a whole segment. We talked a lot about power tools within that. But as we think about the fourth quarter and beyond, I think year-to-date, margins in that business are at 13.5% and you still have somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 million to $100 million of cost synergies to come. Is this a business that can do 15% to 16% type operating margins? Or because of the competitive nature of the peers and the end channel, do you have to start reinvesting that back into the business? I guess, just some help thinking about the fourth quarter rate as well as just longer-term.
Donald Allan: Dennis, it's Don. As far as the fourth quarter rate goes, I mean, I think if you look at the third quarter, it's indicative of what you're going to probably see in the fourth quarter roughly. As far as long term, I believe that this can be a 15% segment from an operating margin perspective. It will require continued execution on the cost synergies. It will require price discipline around inflationary environments et cetera. And of course, the most important thing, it will definitely need to be able to provide continual new products into the marketplace like it's done over the last 12 to 18 months than frankly both companies have done over the last several decades. So those are the keys to being successful and being a market leader with the powerful brands that we have in that particular sector. And when economic market growth comes, and it will some day, I just don't know when, there's no doubt in my mind it will be above 15% operating margin.
Dennis McGill: Okay. The second question relates to just the overall business mix in Europe. I think most of the comments you made seems as though business held in pretty well during the third quarter and you noted maybe some modest softening into the early part of next year. How do you sort of think about the risk of what's going on over there, the risk of the recession, parts of your business that would maybe be most impacted or any red flags that you guys are on the lookout for that we also could be thinking about as it relates to the international exposure?
James M. Loree: It's interesting when you look at what are the risks to our revenue line from a double dip, for example. Let's say that Europe were to drive a double dip in a global sense. The construction market today accounts for about 2/3 of our revenues when you take into account both resi, non-resi and I include DIY in that and commercial. I don't know how much less construction could go on. We're approaching very close to 0. So now could you have inventory corrections? Yes, but they tend to be temporary. So there could be some volatility in some quarters. On the Industrial side, if I go back to 2009 and think back to the implosion that we had in Industrial, driven primarily by inventories, our Industrial production globally was down 2 or 3, 4 points and volume in Industrial was down 20 to 30 points. And that was characteristic across the industrial universe. That could happen again. So as we look at it, we have a reasonable amount of confidence that they will get their act together in the EU, over time. I think most people have a reasonable level of confidence that they will. Nothing happens quickly because there's so much consensus that needs to be built. But if, for some reason, the wheels come off, this is a management team that took this company through the 2008, 2009 downturn, which was gut-wrenching successfully, and we will do it again. And we will use exactly the same approach, which is we will resize the cost structure to line up with the revenues that we will be looking at, at the time. And we will go on the offense during that timeframe and we will take actions to position the company for success, both within the downturn and as we come out of the downturn. Do we think that's going to happen? Absolutely not. Are we cognizant that it could happen and it's more than the de minimis probability? Absolutely, and we're ready for it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Feldman from UBS.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So if we look at the 2012 guidance, the earnings guidance is up about 15%. Free cash guidance looks like its flat to up slightly. It's still pretty good free cash conversion. I think it's about 110%. But when I think about the discrepancy between the growth rates and earnings versus free cash flow for next year, is that primarily because the incremental working capital opportunities are lesser next year or that a big chunk of that work was already done this year? Or is there something else there?
Donald Allan: Jason, it's Don. What I said was we expect to achieve $1.1 billion next year. So we didn't actually give a specific number. We just expect it to be higher. As we finalize our guidance in January and provide more detailed insight, we'll give more specifics about what we think that number is. But to your point about working capital, I think there -- and Jim mentioned it in his presentation, there's a great deal of opportunity to continue to drive working capital benefit. And Jim indicated $0.5 billion of assets that can be freed up from legacy Black & Decker over the next 2 to 3 years. We would expect a portion of that number to be achieved in 2012, and then the vast majority, the remainder of it in 2013 and maybe part of '14.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, Jason, it's John. I mean, it's early days, I think, in fairness to be projecting cash flow. We had a lot of discussion as to what we wanted to say about 2012, but we thought it would help you and everybody on the phone. But I'm quite comfortable saying that remember, a meaningful percentage of the entire management team of Stanley Black & Decker's incentives in measurement is based on cash conversion. So you know it's a focal point for the company. But I think on the same token, taking $100 million or $200 million out of working capital, out of inventory specifically, year in, year out, is not a 2-foot putt straight uphill. There are a lot of moving pieces. And I'm very comfortable with SFS, the traction it's gaining. But the last thing anybody should do, including this management team or anybody on the phone is take it for granted that, that goes on in perpetuity. So there's arguably some thoughtful conservatism in the guidance that Don's giving. And we'll get more granular on that on our first quarter call, and obviously, on the fourth quarter results in January. But your question's a fair one. But I think we're where we need to be for the time being.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: That's helpful. Also if we're thinking about 2012, I understand that none of us has a crystal ball. But if we assume the macro environment remains the same, which seems to be kind of the underlying premise behind the framework that you created for 2012, how should we think about some of the company-specific business situations that you had this year? And what the impact could be on growth rates? And specifically, you have the access business where you had some remodeling delays, so maybe there could be some catch-up there. Presumably next year, we won't have a headwind in fastening in Japan. The Pfister issues anniversary, I believe, next quarter, and kind of the alleviation of those headwinds. Does that wind up potentially having a material impact on the growth rate next year even if the macro environment is unchanged?
John F. Lundgren: Jason, everything you mentioned and approximately 15 things you haven't, some of which are far greater impact, some of which are less, are what went into our thinking as we put our preliminary numbers together. It is really too early to talk about each and every one, not because we won't, it's because we don't think we have a better view than you do. Everything you said and everything we've thought about is baked into the 3.5% global organic growth that in mid-October 2011 is our best guess off a base from where we think we will depart 2011.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I wonder if you could talk about the strength in North America IAR, which is if Europe was down kind of -- soft, it would appear that you had a high single, low double-digit success in America. I know you're talking about the trucks channel penetration. Do you see that as really structural? And how much of that structural component is related to kind of key competitors, Apex Tools, not being as focused? Or could you kind of describe what's going on there because it contributed so much to the margin expansion?
John F. Lundgren: Ken, we're not going to talk about specific competitors on our call. We never have and never will. But Jim can give you a very granular perspective on what's going on, and it's all good.
James M. Loree: Yes. And I think we clearly are getting some help from the market, no question, a couple of points of help from the market. It's been in auto repair with the aging fleet in this country has been a good market, not spectacular but solid. And so that's helped. But I think underlying that, the industrial markets have been healthy as well. In certain segments, such as automotive OEM, for example, in aerospace and some other key segments for that business. So we've had some market tailwinds. But I think the biggest positive thing going on in IAR North America and around the globe is the emergence of that business as a global platform, being run as a global platform as opposed to a series of smaller business units that were not coordinated. And the single biggest benefit from that has been leveraging the product development from the FACOM group based in Europe and driving new products into Mac Tools. And then from a Proto perspective, I think we benefited greatly from its strength in some of the verticals such as petrochem and aerospace and some other verticals that have been strong around the globe. And taking the Black & Decker and Stanley-merged global distribution structure and leveraging Proto across the globe into the emerging markets in other areas around the world, that shows up in North America because it's Proto. And Proto shows up in North America today. I think that's helped as well. So it's been a combination of market strength, and at the same time, I think, improved execution in this business, deriving primarily from changing the business model to be a globally coordinated business with product development centered in Europe and driven into various markets around the world.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And this next question, just because we're going to be approaching the 3-year anniversary of Black & Decker, I wonder if you could just kind of have kind of a broader look back. Obviously, the $6 number which you guys came out early on in 2012, kind of coincides with that 3-year outlook. Could you kind of talk about how obviously there's different -- I think the top line has been pretty similar to what you guys expected at 2%. You guys obviously got more upside on the cost synergies, sales and you have Niscayah and some other things. Can you just kind of talk about the prospect of how that $6 that you came out with do appreciate early compares to kind of what you thought the business would be like 3 years ago? If that's a fair question.
Donald Allan: Ken, it's Don. If you think about going back to November of 2009 when we announced the transaction, we had a view of the top line that was very little growth, about 2% or so, 2% or 3% and we had $350 million of cost synergies and we haven't provided any estimates of revenue synergies at that point. Subsequent to what's happened, since then and the last almost coming up on 2 years, I guess, of the announcement in the next month, we've increased our cost synergies to $485 million on an annualized basis for 2013. We've got revenue synergies of $300 million to $400 million. And frankly, the top line growth has been a little bit stronger than that 2% number that you were talking, not a lot. So you have a little bit of that going on as well. Offsetting some of those positive things, as we certainly didn't expect the commodity inflationary environment we had in 2011. We've been able to mitigate that partially with the price increases we talked about throughout the year and today. But we had a vision of being $5 EPS and $1 billion free cash flow in year 3. We're achieving over $1 billion free cash flow this year and we're over $5 EPS this year. So we're certainly well ahead of schedule based on the items that I kind of laid out and feel very pleased with where we are in the current state of the integration.
John F. Lundgren: And Ken, I'll add because you'll get cut off. From a qualitative perspective, we're very pleased. It's as simple as that. Starting at the board level, the way the expertise from the 2 boards have come together. We just finished the board meeting and you have to stop and think who was the legacy Stanley director, who was the Black & Decker director. Corporate headquarters is in New Britain, Connecticut. Stanley was the prevailing company. That makes sense. We're running our CDIY business from Towson, Maryland, the entire CDIY-wide business, that's where Black & Decker Power Tools is headquartered. We run the entire Security business from Indianapolis. We run our IAR business, as Jim said, as a global platform from Brussels, Belgium in a neutral site. And if you sit in a meeting, whether it be a strategy review, a budget review or a quarterly review, we're at the stage where you have stop and think that the person presenting was legacy Stanley or legacy Black & Decker. I would tell you and Mark Mathieu, our Senior Vice President of Human Resources, would tell you that's the acid test beyond the numbers, how it's coming together. And less than 2 full years into it or exactly 2 years post-announcement, I feel very good as the CEO of this company where we are. That being said, I feel equally passionate that we need to continue at the same pace to truly differentiate this company from its competitors. And that's what we intend to do.
Operator: Our final question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: With respect to Europe, I know there's a lot of concern about Europe these days. Don, in your remarks, I think you mentioned that you expected Europe to be soft in the first half and stable in the second half. Can you help us calibrate the risk in the 2012 European story by giving us some kind of EPS sensitivity to a percentage change in your revenue or maybe an incremental margin?
John F. Lundgren: David, this is John. In the interest of everybody, Don has done that and so maybe we could check the transcript that simply said, "We don't think it's going to get any worse." And when the global CDIY and construction market was down 75%, our unit volume was down 15%. So we just don't see step function changes due to a 2% or 3% softening in European GDP. It's 23% of our business. We've got meaningful platforms with all 3 businesses. I mean, round numbers. We've got $800 billion Security business, CDIY business and Industrial business. So it's a 3-legged stool. So I don't want to be cavalier and hopefully, I don't sound that way about the macroeconomic conditions in Europe. There's nothing we can do to control it. We spend our time worrying about the things and focusing on the things over which we do have some control and making sure we have contingency plans, as Jim described in great detail. Were it to get really bad, what we would do about it? So as a consequence that macroeconomic conditions in Europe had a more than 100 or 200 basis point negative impact on our top line, we would adjust our cost structure accordingly to deliver our earnings commitment.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. I guess, just as a follow-up question. You're active on the share repurchase program this quarter. You've indicated in the past that you devote about 1/3 of your free cash flow back to the shareholders. On the $1.1 billion free cash flow look, it's, what, $350 million, $370 million of free cash, your dividend consumes about $280 million of that. I guess, the question is just how much more active you can be on the share repurchase front going forward?
Donald Allan: I think Jim touched on this, and I believe he was answering a question earlier on. We will continue to evaluate if we're looking at a U.S. acquisition, the alternative of doing a share repurchase. That being said, our cash is all overseas. And so for us to do that, we have to pay a tax and that really makes it very difficult hurdle when you're measuring against the potential acquisition. I don't foresee a great deal of share repurchase in the short and medium-term, but that's something we continue to evaluate as market conditions, in particular the equity markets, seem to fluctuate and have volatility.
Kate White Vanek: Kim, I believe that concludes our call today. I want to thank everybody for chiming in and joining us. As always, please contact me afterwards with questions. And thank you, all.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

We direct you to the cautionary statements and Form 8-K, which we filed with the press release and our most recent '34 Act. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.
John Lundgren: Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody. Just -- I'm going to touch on some highlights before Jim gets into some more detail on the segments but as we look back on the second quarter, we remain on a steady course of organic growth despite an unfavorable macroeconomic backdrop. We did get some better news this morning that Jim and Don will touch on as it relates to the macroeconomic environment. But nonetheless, our performance and the organic growth we were able to achieve were driven primarily by new products that we introduced to the market, where we gained share in established markets and continued strong performance in the emerging markets. Again, that -- I'll touch on it a little later. Second quarter revenues were up 11% to $2.6 billion, organically plus 3%. And that, of course, excludes the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Organic growth in Power Tools and Accessories, Industrial and our Convergent Security Solutions was somewhat muted by weakness in Hand Tools, Outdoor Products and ongoing Pfister impact. Don talked about the Pfister impact in the first quarter, but just to shed a little more light on Outdoor, which we referenced in the press release, particularly for those of you who are less familiar with that business, Outdoor is a $550 million to $600 million business, and it is one of the few businesses that's quite seasonal. It's split roughly 60/40 first half, second half historically, with the second quarter almost every year being the largest quarter. We all know there was -- across the country the weather was terrible in the second quarter regardless of where we were.  But just in round numbers, it's just math, the 20% decline in the second quarter unrecovered on an annual basis is almost 70 basis points of organic growth across the entire company. So just take that in mind as Don is doing his outlook and the fact that we lowered organic growth estimates for the year, 100 basis points. The overwhelming majority of that is the result of Pfister business that we did -- excuse me, of Outdoor business that we didn't achieve in the second quarter, much of which, based on history, is gone and won't be recovered.  Our EPS was $1.46, excludes M&A charges and does reflect the $0.28 benefit attributable to the favorable tax settlement of the outstanding tax contingencies. GAAP EPS of $1.14 includes the M&A related charges and the $1.18 excludes the charges and as well as the favorable settlement. And that was in line with management's expectations and the direction that Don gave on our first quarter call, that approximately 45% of our core earnings would be achieved in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half, based on the way the year was rolling forward for us.  13.6% operating margin, again, that excludes the charges. 120 basis point sequential increase in CDIY. Security, profitability to total segment increased 300 basis points sequentially and 120 basis points VPY or versus second quarter 2010. And Industrial increased 110 basis points versus the second quarter of 2010. Our integration remains on track. In fact, it remains ahead of plan. Good progress there and we -- as the year progresses, we were able to shed some more light on that. We've been able to accelerate some of the 2011 cost synergy realization, specifically by $35 million. So our total synergy target, we've been able to raise from -- to $450 million by the end of 2012, that's up from $425 million. And for clarity, that means the annualized impact at the end of 2012 goes from $460 million to $485 million.  Last but not least, as it relates to the integration, you won't see this in the numbers directly but we just completed a global employee survey, and it yielded very positive results as it relates to the cultural integration of these 2 companies. As we said at the time of the merger, there were many similarities but there were also some differences in these 2 companies, and we were very, very encouraged that 12 to 15 months later, that we received the kind of results that we did from this survey that in general suggests everyone's on the same page, everyone's focused on the same objectives, everyone's motivated, and while that won't show up directly in the numbers, I think we all know it will show up long term in the numbers and we took a lot of comfort from that survey, and it validated -- further validated the success thus far of the integration, both on a qualitative as well as quantitative perspective.  Working capital, another good story. Turns increased 14% to 5.8 as SFS operational principles are expanded and embedded across a larger business base. Looking at the integration specifically in some of the key milestones, the biggest news, as I think was quite clear in the press release, is that we're moving $35 million forward into -- from 2012 into 2011, yet holding 2012. So essentially, we're $100 million higher than our original estimate and we're getting it 3 months earlier. So it's, all in all, a continued good story.  Looking at the top left of the chart, we were able to do that because our Synergy Steering Committee continues to meet quite regularly. We did our annual refresh process and we identified $25 million of additional opportunities. Several of our major footprint-related projects that we've talked about have been launched, and we've said these are -- but even more important, we track these carefully because there is much more interdependency, there's more complexity. Some of the months that we've talked about are in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, Rock Falls, Jackson, Tennessee, all underway or nearing completion. We recently announced plans as it relates to our Redding, Pennsylvania facility. There are others in Europe that need to be worked through, our work councils, unions and employees, et cetera, that are not yet announced. But much in North America, underway or completed, Europe's starting to roll, and we continue to be very confident about our ability to achieve all of the objectives that we've identified in conjunction with those programs. By the second half of '11, we'll have completed the 2 major distribution center and 3 major plant consolidations. And relative to the numbers that we've talked about, by the end of 2011, we will have executed projects that represent 75% of the 2012 cost savings of about $425 million. And that was what we've said as little as 3 months ago. What we're doing with our update is saying that by the end of '11, we will have executed projects now that represent almost 85% of the 2012 savings of $450 million. So 10% of higher completion rate of a pool that's $25 million higher than we estimated at 3 months ago. So, needless to say, we are a; pleased, and b; confident. Pleased with the progress thus far and confident in our ability to continue with that pace.  Last but not least on the integration, compelling revenue synergies opportunities continue to surface and grow. DeWalt Tools, through the Industrial channels, Hand Tools in Latin America are among the 2 largest successes to date, and Jim will talk a little bit about those when he reviews the segments. So we're in a good place on cost synergies that allowed us to raise our estimate, which is a good thing in the face of this current economic environment. Looking really quickly at the region, revenue and profit growth continues to be driven by the emerging markets, really good story. The emerging markets now account for 15% of our total revenue. That's up from 11% at the end of 2010. So these markets continue to grow. We're dedicating both financial and human resources to these markets because we recognize what an important part of our future they represent.  In North America, on the left, organic growth of 1%. Lot of puts and calls, Jim's going to come on to those so -- in the interest of time and not wanting to duplicate efforts. I'll move on to Europe, which is our second largest geography, where organic growth was 2%. It represents 24% of the company, and Industrial performed very well in Europe. CDIY was soft but all in, we were able to achieve 2% organic growth, which is a good story in Europe. Latin America, up 26%, now represents 9% of our total company's revenues. We're really pleased. Canada was down 7%, primarily Weiser Locks within the MAS segment or HHI. It's a new neighbor to outdoor in terms of a lot of it is weather related, and we don't regard that as a continuing trend but it did have an impact on organic growth in the quarter. Canada, 6% of our revenue and it was down 7%, so the numbers are clear. We remain pleased with our performance in Asia. It represents 5% of the company, organically up 4%, but if you see the blue balloon, excluding Engineered Fastening in Japan, Asia organic growth was up 15%. Jim is going to talk about this a little bit in the segments about Emhart, but Japan is bouncing back nicely from the tragedy that they suffered late in the first quarter. Our largest Engineered Fastening customer is up to about 80% of its historical production levels as that gradually becomes a more normal working environment. But considering the importance of Japan to our Emhart or Engineered Fastening business, we're quite pleased with our performance in Asia as well. Moving on to the sources of growth, as mentioned in my first bullet point, Power Tools, Industrial and Convergent Security, they posted the more solid organic growth during the quarter, and that was partially offset by weakness in our Mechanical Security business, the Outdoor that we've talked about, and the Pfister issues that we absorbed in the first quarter, but will be with us throughout the year. Really quickly, volume was up 3%. Price was flat. A lot of puts and calls, but for the quarter, as Don guided, price was flat in the second quarter, consistent with our expectations. Currency added 5%, acquisitions another 3%, so that gets us to our 11% total revenue. Looking at some of our larger businesses. Industrial continues to be a really positive story, 9% organic growth. Hand Tools, Fastening & Power Tools together or our core tool businesses, if you will, up 7%. Convergent Security, up 4%; Mechanical Access, down 1%; Outdoor Home, down 17%; and Pfister, 21%. A lot of puts and calls but at the end of the day, 3% organic growth across the entire system, and Jim will give you a little more detail on each of the segments as he walks through those.  I'll turn it over to him.
James Loree: Okay. Thank you, John. Let's start with CDIY. Second quarter CDIY revenue was $1.364 billion, up 5%. Excluding FX, sales were flat. Price was flat. That's the tier of Delta Woodworking and the consumer auto electronics product line cost 2 points, and that basically offset the 2 points of unit volume growth.  Operating profit was $195 million, down 3% versus 2Q '10 but profit rate was 14.3%, off 120 basis points versus a year ago, but up 120 basis points sequentially. That's almost $40 million of inflation in the quarter, which was expected, that would offset the benefit of synergies. Now, the pricing actions that we've taken do not take hold until the third quarter. So some of this margin degradation that was associated with the inflation was definitely anticipated. The organic growth was a little weaker than expected. As John mentioned, it was 2%. There was a lot going on behind that number, certainly, as we already talked about to some extent. Pfister was a headwind of about 2 points, the divestitures, I mentioned, were another 2 points and the lost outdoor season that John described cost us 1 point, so total headwinds of about 5 points. So if you take the 2% growth with those headwinds, the rest of the segment actually had a terrific performance in this kind of a market, up 7%.  And if you look at the organic growth chart there, you can see the Professional Power Tools & Accessories and Consumer Power Tools were both significantly positive, with Professional Power Tools & Accessories up 13% and Consumer Power Tools up 7%. So very, very good performances fueled by the new product introductions, some of the revenue synergies and a very successful quarter from that perspective for those units. Hand Tools and Fastening, it doesn't have quite -- to the same extent of new product activity and you can see, although it does have the DeWalt Hand Tools, which we began shipping in the quarter, was slightly negative. And then the Outdoor and Home Products part of the company or part of the segment was down 17%. So I'd say in light of the weak market, it was still a very strong performance.  So in the face of this weaker than already weak market that we predicted, as well as a hefty dose of inflation, as we also predicted, CDIY held its own and now looks forward to a stronger second half with little-to-no help expected from the markets, although there was some encouraging news this morning on housing starts, which I'm sure everyone has seen, it would emphasize that we haven't really built any of that into our forecasts. We think that we'll have this better performance in the second half from an organic growth perspective because the revenue synergies will continue, our pricing actions will kick in, the 18 volt, 20 volt cordless launch and the DeWalt Hand Tools launch will also gain momentum in the second half and it should be a pretty good story, and who knows, with a little help possibly from the market that we haven't built in. So that's CDIY. Moving now to Security. In Security, second quarter revenue was $622 million, up 9%, 5 points from acquisitions, 3 points from currency, 1 point organic. Operating profit was $103 million, which was up 16%. The profit rate was 16.8%, up 120 basis points versus a year ago and 290 basis points sequentially, and without the acquisitions, the profit rate was actually 17.6% due to the dilutive impact of the GMT and InfoLogix acquisitions in their early stages. The profit growth derived from synergies associated with the merger, productivity projects, very strong performance there and tight SG&A control, which more than offset the inflation. Moving to organic growth, the Convergent business was up 4% and that was a very encouraging performance given that installs outpaced RMR growth and national accounts showed very strong signs of life. So we continue to see progress in the CSS area, and I would expect to see that continue as we go forward. The Mechanical business or MAS as it's called here, residential is flattish to down 1 point, access technologies, the automatic door business, was off 4 points organic growth. And that was driven, actually, by their largest customer who has cut back on some remodeling scope as the year has progressed. And then the commercial locking business, I thought was quite encouraging with organic growth of 3 points. And you can start to see the benefit of a little life in the commercial markets in the U.S. affecting that. So the Electronic business is showing signs of better growth, momentum is growing there, Mechanical, still dealing with weak markets, although Commercial looks more promising, both businesses are managing margins and profit growth effectively.  And then just going to the geographic mix for a minute, it's one of our issues with this business, for a long time, has been the fact that it is so North-American-centric. And that's not surprising since we basically created this business almost from nothing, about 7 or 8 years ago. And today, it's a $2.4 billion business, roughly. But at 77%, North American right now and with the recently announced Niscayah acquisition, this issue is going to be addressed. This will add about $250 million of revenue per quarter to our Security segment, of which, 85% is outside the U.S. and it will take the non-North American content of this segment to over 50% of the revenue. So that's some very encouraging news. And speaking of Niscayah, just a couple of brief comments on that. On June 27, we announced the offer. This week, we were notified or we -- the mandatory waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino expired, so the U.S. has given us the greenlight for the transaction as it relates to antitrust. EU approval is still pending. The process with the Swedish company is -- the Swedish regulators and the EU work in tandem. We have filed -- we have been in contact with the authorities. We filed the paperwork that's necessary. We expect to hear some news in the next few days and we're hoping that the EU commission will confirm that it has no further questions and that we will be able to take the next step if all goes well there, with short form clearance. And then, we will begin a 30-day offer period, which will enable the shareholders to tender their shares and we will, at the end of that 30 days, determine if 90% of the shares have been tendered. If so, the offer will go unconditional, and we'll close shortly thereafter. I will remind everybody that the acquisition, if successful which we hope it will be, is highly accretive, with $0.20 of accretion in year 1 and $0.45 in year 3, most of which, we'll begin to see the impact of in 2012 as -- if the transaction closes as expected. Moving on to Industrial. Industrial is once again a strong sales and profit growth driver for the company. Second quarter revenue was $636 million, up 29%. Acquisitions provided 13 points of growth, FX accounted for 7 points, organic growth was 9 points or 9%, including 2 points of price. Operating profit was $98 million, up $27 million or 38% and it came in at 15.4%, up 110 basis points versus 2Q '10 and down 210 basis points sequentially. If we go to the organic growth chart there, we can see the Industrial & Automotive Repair business had an exceptional performance, with 13% organic growth and a terrific performance in North America, with both Mac and Proto up almost 20% each organically, with very strong operating margins, and storage sales were also strong.  And just as a sidenote, we've just opened up a new Vidmar plant in China, which can make the high-end Vidmar cabinets of the same quality and performance in China as we make in Allentown, Pennsylvania. They will be for the Asian market and not for import into the U.S. for the most part.  Engineered Fastening was up 6%, which was a heroic effort, I think, given the tremendous difficulties that we had in Japan, with production down in Japan, automotive production down 40%. And in the quarter, Japanese auto production was reduced to 8% of global production, down from 13% a year ago. So for -- in total, global auto production was down 2% for the quarter. So for these folks to be up 6%, that truly is a great story involving increased penetration of fasteners, new products and good nameplate mix. So great story there.  CRC-Evans performed well, with revenue up mid-single digits, and despite a slow natural gas pipeline market in the U.S., in North America. And hydraulics, some -- a business we don't often talk about when we talk about the quarter here because they're only 10% of the segment, was up 40%. So a huge growth driver in the segment, with really strong markets and really great performance in handheld, railroad and their mounted product lines.  So the entire segment was a terrific story. It looks like it will continue to perform well in the second half, although we think the growth rates may moderate somewhat, but the profit rate and the momentum will continue.  Now, I'll turn it over to Don Allan.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. I'd like to spend a little bit of time talking about working capital on Page 12. We're very pleased with our working capital performance this quarter, where working capital turns increased 14% and revenue increased 11%. It grew 11% as you heard from John earlier. So that means our turns went from 5.1 to 5.8 turns year-over-year, which is an excellent performance. And sequentially, they went from 5.3 turns up to that 5.8 number, which was about a 9% improvement.  What I find really encouraging about this particular chart is when you look at the aspects of rolling out the Stanley Fulfillment System into any new aspect of our company, in particular Legacy Black & Decker, what we tend do is attack the receivables and payables first. And you're starting to see the effects of that, where receivable days are 56 and payable days are 70, and you had a nice improvement in both those categories year-over-year. As we focus on credit and collections and the efficiency of collecting our cash on our receivables, as well as improving the turns and the relationships with our vendors, so they're more in line with how we like to do business for those particular companies and entities as we go forward. So it's great to see that progress and really beginning to see the traction as the global enterprise continue to embrace the different tenets of the Stanley Fulfillment System.  How does that translate into cash flow? On the next page, first of all, I just want to remind everybody that the cash flow, the free cash flow that we're showing here is -- exclude M&A or merger and acquisition payments. So it gives you a good sense of the operational cash flow performance is. If we start with working capital, you can see there wasn't a large benefit because we did have a large growth in revenue. But we were able to maintain the cash flow performance in the second quarter. We do expect that to turn positive as the year progresses. As many of you know, we tend to have a seasonality of our working capital performance in the fourth quarter in particular, as well as combining that with the different projects and initiatives around the Stanley Fulfillment System will allow that to become a positive number by the end of 2011.  One thing of note on this page, as you see in Other, there's a large negative, $131 million in the second quarter and about $218 million year-to-date. What you have going on there is a couple of things, the primary drivers of that is the tax settlement that we achieved in both the first and the second quarter, which totaled about $70 million, the large part of that was noncash. And so you have the benefit in net income and you have the negative effect being backed out in Other, which is really what's driving a lot of what's in that line. The other thing in there is we do have pension contributions, as many of you know, from the Legacy Black & Decker pension plan, slightly underfunded. So we continue to make some pension contributions, which are about $40 million, $45 million year-to-date. Those 2 things are the large driver of why that's negative. And we do have a few timing items in there through the first half of the year that we expect to reverse in terms -- and those results in a slightly lower negative by the end of the year.  The other item here is CapEx. CapEx is trending very nicely. It's at -- through 6 months, 2.1% of revenue, which is at the lower end of our guidance range, and we would expect that trend to continue throughout the year. Now one thing you might look at when you look at this page is that $235 million of free cash flow through 6 months, and we are reiterating our guidance of $1.1 billion. If you look back historically at both legacy companies, Black & Decker and Stanley, the vast majority of the cash flow that's generated by both companies happens in the back half of the year and a large part of it in the fourth quarter. And the 5-year history of both companies indicates that the first half, as a percentage of the full year, tends to represent somewhere between 22% and 25% of the full year free cash flow performance. If you take those percentages, there's [ph] the $235 million, you get very close to that $1.1 billion, which is why we feel comfortable reiterating that cash flow guidance for all of 2011. So a little more information on P&L guidance on Page 14. As our press release indicated, we have raised our EPS guidance range, excluding M&A charges to $5.15, up to $5.40. That's an increase of a $0.15 from the previous guidance range we provided back in April, and that is solely due to the $0.15 of additional settlement of tax contingencies that occurred in the second quarter. If we look at the year for our tax rate related to our guidance range, we're now expecting the tax rate to be 19% to 20%, which is down 1 point from the previous range that we provided in April, which was 20% to 21%.  Looking at operational aspects of our guidance, as indicated by John as well as in our press release, we have lowered our guidance for the year on net organic sales by 1 point down to 4% to 5%, based off the pro forma level of $9.3 billion of sales for 2010. That's down from the 5.5% to 6% that we provided back in April. And as many of you know, the guidance that we provided did not have any market growth in the mature markets, in particular, in Continental Europe and the United States and Canada. That continues to be the case in the guidance that we're provided. But it certainly creates an ability to offset some of the headwinds that we're seeing in both the weather-related, outdoor performance that John and Jim discussed, as well as the weaker European market that we've experienced in the second quarter in the CDIY segment, which was down modestly in that period.  So we do have a slight negative as a result of that and as of now, we do not have any market improvement in the mature countries that I mentioned. But we'll see as housing starts was positive, as Jim indicated earlier, up 14% in the month of June. We'll see if that is something that allows for improvement in the back half of the year, but we're not including that in our guidance at this point in time. Cost synergies, as John mentioned, we believe will now be $200 million in 2011, which is up from $165 million estimate that we provided 3 months ago, and how that translates to 2012, we believe will be at $450 million in that timeframe, which is an annualized number of $485 million as we go into 2013, which means the implied 2012 number is approximately $115 million. Another item of note is that due to the situation with Niscayah and the potential acquisition, we did suspend our repurchase program in the second quarter of stock of 250 million, but we will commence that program again, either later this week or early next week, and we expect our shares outstanding to approximate 172.5 million for the year.  We are reiterating certain aspects of our guidance on the right side of the page. As you can see, revenue synergies, we expect to still be approximately 50 basis points of growth in 2011 with a modest EPS impact. The acquisition revenue for the acquisitions listed here on the page, approximately 3%. And we continue to believe that our operating margin rate expansion will be 150 basis points from the 2010 levels, which is just slightly over 14% for the year, and embedded in that is that negative 100 basis points from the price inflation arbitrage that we've primarily experienced in the first half of the year, as we start to see the positive impact to price the second half of 2011. In the non-merger and acquisition-related restructuring, we still expect it to approximate to $25 million or consistent with 2010 levels.  So with that, I'd like to provide a little more insight on each segment on Page 15. Consistent with the company, we're tightening our guidance range or our thoughts around performance of CDIY for the year, for revenue, organic revenue to be approximately 4% to 5%. And it's really due to the weaknesses that we mentioned in Outdoor products, as well as in Europe that's driving the vast majority of that. The first half performance for organic growth was approximately 2%, but when you adjust it for certain things such as the outdoor product performance, as well as the expected price benefit in the back half of the year and comps as they become easier in the second half because we saw significant stock or restocking in the first half of 2010. And then, we saw a slower performance in the back half of 2010, which makes the comps easier as we go out through the remainder of this year.  We expect operating margin accretion to continue in the second half of 2011 because of incremental cost synergies, positive impact from new products, the pricing actions that I just referred to are really helping to mitigate the inflation, that's now in our run rate. Jim touched on the share gains that we're getting in the various new products that are continuing to be rolled out. Many of them started in the first half, but we'll see the full effect of that in the back half of the year with the cordless power tools, as well as the DeWalt hand tools that started to launch in late June and will continue to roll out through the summer. Moving to Security, we're very pleased with the Security performance in the second quarter as Jim mentioned. And from a top line perspective, through 6 months, the organic growth is slightly positive. We expect that to continue to get slightly better as the second half progresses, and we believe we'll have a low single-digit organic growth performance for the entire year, that's being driven by the Convergent or Electronic Security growth as it continues at a healthy pace. It continues to get better as the second half progress.  Also, we will see more favorable performance in the back half in our residential hardware business, as we did have some inventory corrections, if you remember, in the third quarter of 2010, and that will provide a slightly easier comp as a result of that. And we do expect the strength that we saw in the commercial hardware business in the second quarter to continue at that modest pace into the back half of the year. Margins will continue to slightly improve across the entire Security segment as we continue the integration of the SSDS business. And we continue to drive the integration across mechanical security and residential hardware. Moving to Industrial. Industrial, as Jim mentioned, very strong performance through the first half of the year. Organic growth is 11%. We are indicating that for the year, we expect mid single-digit growth. And let me make sure that people understand what that means. We define mid single-digit growth as somewhere between 3% to 8%. And clearly, we expect this to trend to the high end of that range, which is at 8% based on the performance they've had in the first half of the year and expected performance in the back half. There will be a lower growth rate in the back half versus the 11% due to the comps, as well as other items that I'll touch on in a few minutes. Industrial & Automotive Repair continues to be strong. They continue to gain share and exceed market growth that's occurring in the industries that they serve. We're very pleased with that performance and they're really starting to get some traction with revenue synergies as well. The Emhart business or Engineered Fastening business is seeing nice growth even though the light vehicle production was slow in the second quarter. We expect that to be better in the third quarter and the fourth quarter as we see improvement in Japan. And we expect that our business will continue to outperform the production levels as we've seen in the first half of the year.  And in the offshore channel business, we're starting to see more activity and more life there in our infrastructure business. So we expect that to drive some growth as well in the back half, which is why we believe we'll see that performance in the -- around that 8% level for the year for this particular segment. So to summarize the call this morning, we feel excellent about where we are with the integration. It continues to proceed very well. We've accelerated synergies into 2011, as you saw, by increasing our estimates to $200 million. And we've raised the overall estimates for the whole program to $450 million by the end of 2012, which again it creates the $485 million annualized into 2013. The volume and margin growth expected in the second half due to new products, the pricing actions, emerging markets really allows us to feel like we're on track, so that 150 basis points year-over-year OM expansion that I discussed earlier. John touched on the revenue synergies and the progress we're making. It's very smooth in the implementation and the results have been compelling so far. So we continue to invest in that in both people and other assets to really drive that growth throughout the remainder of the year. I touched on the Stanley Fulfillment System and the impact on working capital, and working capital turns improving by 14% year-over-year, which is really nice to see the tenets of SFS really getting embedded in our company globally. And then of course, we are reiterating our $1.1 billion in free cash flow forecast for the year.  With that, that completes the presentation portion of the call, I want to turn it to Q&A.
Kate White Vanek: Time for Q&A, all. John, our operator will be kicking it off and as always, we'll follow the one question and one follow-up routine.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: Can you give a little more color on the 80% cost recovery in the back half a little bit, just across the portfolio, where the expectations are? And then also, provide perhaps a bit of input on what you've learned as you started to have these discussions and how things have fared to this point?
John Lundgren: Yes, Eric, this is John. I'll kick it off and Don will give you a little more granularity. From 36,000 feet, we're absolutely holding to that recovery. We're getting a little less price than we'd anticipated, and one of the reasons we're getting a little less in CDIY is inflation is abating or the -- if you will, the escalation has slowed down, so we're getting a little less second-half inflation compared to where we left off. So all in, the 80% is still good. But I'll let Don give you a little more granularity.
Donald Allan: Yes, Eric. I mean, we are comfortable that we will see an 80% recovery as indicated in the back half of the year. There's been a lot of moving parts and dynamics associated with inflation and price. The vast majority of our price increases are in place, although we still have a few smaller ones that we're negotiating over this month. But by the end of July, we feel comfortable that all price increases will be in place. And on the inflation side, we've seen some pluses and minuses. As John alluded to, we've seen some trends that have caused production inflation and we've also seen some trends that are increasing inflation. So we're managing. We're continuing to manage that dynamic but at this point, we still feel comfortable that we'll have 80% price recovery in the back half of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Feldman from UBS.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank: So obviously, there's a lot of focus on the Black & Decker related cost synergies. I find it interesting though that at IAR, your margin expansion was very substantial. So legacy business without the acquisition-related synergies, and I think it was actually second quarter of last year it started doing much better. Are there other areas in the legacy business, not included kind of in that $450 million synergy target, where you see material opportunities for operational improvement?
James Loree: Well, this is Jim. I mean, IAR is predominantly a nonrevenue, noncost synergy story. It's really an execution story. And I'd say they've done a great job over the last year pulling that business together on a global platform basis and treating it as if it were one company instead of a series of popcorn stands. So I think that's a terrific story. Engineered Fastening, which is another part of the Industrial segment, when they went through the downturn, they dealt with severe contraction in the automotive market. And they really did a phenomenal job bringing their cost structure down even before the merger. And as the automotive market came back last year and into this year, prior to the second quarter with the Japan issues, they have kept their cost structure intact and they have a tremendous operating leverage story. So I think that is another one that we're particularly proud of. But I think you're still seeing across the portfolio, for instance, in Security, their margin growth is not driven solely by revenue -- or cost synergies. It's driven almost equally as much by a terrific story, managing productivity projects and controlling SG&A levels. So you've got those stories, I think, across the portfolio and the CDIY folks have -- are battling a lot of headwinds. But I think they, too, have managed the productivity element of the equation extremely effectively.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. And a quick clarification on the guidance. I'm just, I guess, a little bit confused, and I'm sorry if I'm missing something. On the 150 basis points of margin expansion that was reiterated for the year, the revised guidance has basically lower revenue and more cost savings, so wouldn't that suggest that the operating margin expansion would be higher than in the prior version of guidance?
Donald Allan: No. Jason, this is Don. I get the question but I would say no. When you look at the components of revenue and then the profitability of those revenues and -- as well as the increased synergies and other dynamics that are changing that are pluses and minuses, it puts you roughly to the same place year-over-year expansion in operating margin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Crédit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG: Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the launches of DeWalt in August, what you're thinking about doing in terms of just the spending behind the marketing of that to make sure it's getting traction there in this tough climate?
James Loree: I'll take it, Dan. We're not going to reveal our spending plans for competitors to jump all over or counterpunch. But simply said, if you look at SG&A, it's totally in line with expectations and with former guidance. We have very robust plans in support of those launches and one of the reasons we talked about CDIY in the second quarter margins, we really had a semi-hiatus same period a year ago, so we are comparing against a low spending base. Essentially, I'll call it brand support and product introduction support. In fact, the historical level in line with where it should be as a percentage of SG&A. And I'll go so far as to say thus far, customer acceptance and future plans we're quite -- we're very encouraged by it and we would not have gotten that level of acceptance without meaningful levels of support. But it's just not appropriate to give you any more granularity than that. And I hope you understand.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG: Sure, I understand that. And I guess secondly, just wondering in terms of as you look at growth opportunities as you're pursuing Niscayah right now, would you be content to -- finishing with the integration of Black & Decker and looking at Niscayah or are you still looking at other opportunities here at this time?
John Lundgren: I guess any of us could take that. The pipeline is really full but the playbook will be the same. We will look at both financial capacity and organizational capacity. The beauty of Niscayah, as we pointed out, it's primarily a foreign acquisition made with foreign cash, extraordinarily good use of a somewhat dormant resource. That, in and of itself, would make it a good deal. The fact that it's highly strategic, it's been a coveted asset and it's quite accretive makes it an even better deal. We'll still have plenty of cash. If it's a business and a geography that will not interfere with the integration of either of those businesses, we could still opt -- unlikely, this year's 2/3 is over from an M&A perspective, unlikely, we could execute -- would execute anything else this year. But we'll start the meter running again as we look forward to next year. The pipeline is quite full. The only change in environment that I know you're well aware of is with financing being relatively inexpensive. Private equity or financial sponsors are far more meaningful part of any competition for good assets than perhaps they were 2 or 3 years ago when we did the Black & Decker deal. But it's a robust environment with a lot of opportunity. Jim, may want to add something.
James Loree: Yes. I think just in -- to take it from a complementary but slightly different perspective, what we're basically doing here from a capital allocation perspective is taking about 1/3 of our excess capital and returning it to the shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases and taking the other 2/3 and investing it in acquisitions that are strategically linked to our key franchises and our growth platforms, but are also able to produce cash flow return on investment returns in the 13% to 15% range over time. And we think that is a great way to create shareholder value. However, if we don't execute on the acquisitions and deliver those returns, then we could destroy value. So we're very conscious of making sure that we only invest when we are confident that we can do that, which means we have the organizational capacity to do so. And so, financial capacity, organizational capacity, getting back to what John said, is critical both from a tactical and a strategic perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan.
William Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co: This is actually Will Wong on for Mike. Just a quick question. When you talk about your outlook, not including any rebound in residential construction, first can you just remind us how much residential construction exposure you have across the 3 segments? And then secondly, when do you expect sort of residential market to rebound and when that will be built into your forecast?
Kate White Vanek: Hi, Will. This is Kate. First, I'm going to point you to the appendix of our investor overview, which is always on our website. That has the breakdown by segment and by business of our exposures to residential construction. So as of 2010 pro forma, about 20% of total Stanley was residential, 28% was other residential, meaning sort of outdoor, repair, remodel. Second, we're not going to be in the business of predicting the housing rebound, and I think you understand. And I think if we were, we would be embedding it in our guidance and having a lot more conviction behind it. But that's not the stance that we're going to take today.
William Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. Great. And then just my follow-up question, in terms of the weather-related weakness in outdoors, how are you guys able to discern what was sort of weather-related weakness versus maybe an overall demand coming in weaker?
James Loree: Yes, I'll take it, Will, the one -- essentially, overwhelmingly, it was weather-related. We can take it off-line but the one reliable source I've seen that measures, essentially, hours available for outdoor activities through May, not through June, because the data isn't available yet, that would mean using our outdoor products, participating in various sports, et cetera, it's syndicated resource. Through May, those hours were down 26%. So if you think about -- we were down about 19% with our outdoor, that would tell us that we may even have gained a little bit of share. But the overwhelming majority, if not more than 100% of the softness, was weather-related. You don't hear us talk about weather very often. Legacy Stanley, I think the only businesses that would have -- are impacted by that are Access Technologies and to a small extent, Gate Hardware in our legacy hardware business. So this is new for the Stanley side of the merger, not new for the folks who've lived with this business for a long time. But the simple answer is I would say 100-plus percent of the shortfall was weather-related. Thus, we don't anticipate that it's going to repeat itself. That's the good news. The bad news is second quarter is always your biggest quarter, and when you get past June or July, and you haven't sold it, it's generally gone for the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: A couple of questions. First off, the change -- the 1% change in the organic growth, it seems like the vast majority of that is already spoken for with Q2. I'm looking on a go-forward basis, how much have you revised your European demand expectations and what are those European growth expectations given as 1/4 of your business?
Donald Allan: Sam, it's Don. I would say on the outdoor component, I would say the vast majority of that is behind us. As far as the European component, we do expect slightly negative performance in the back half of the year, which is what we experienced in the second quarter. So that trend will continue and contribute to the whole 1% decline that we talked about for the year.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then John, hopefully I'm going to be phrasing this question right. Based on a bunch of recent security industry transactions and multiples, it would seem that the overall stock market might be materially undervaluing either your Security business or your Tools business. And I was just curious as to what your view on the subject might be and maybe what options you and the board consider in terms of unlocking latent value?
John Lundgren: I guess, I'll say 2 things. It should be obvious that the markets grossly undervaluing both our Tools and Security business, but I would argue that those of us on this side of the call are biased. Look, Security at legacy Stanley grew from nothing to almost 40% of our revenues. And Jim, Don and I spend a lot of time talking about that and with the board. And we always felt that if it got to 50% of our revenues, and wasn't being valued properly, we'd think about some alternatives for it. With the acquisition or merger of Black & Decker, Security has slipped back to less than 25% of the business. With Niscayah, it will be about 30%. So you can argue just based on market multiples, we have an 11x or 12x EBITDA business trapped inside a 7x or 8x company. We would all argue that's a very, very high-class problem, because we're -- were it to be -- come to a point where it's a stand-alone company that would be valued higher. We'd create a tremendous value for our shareholders and it's something we'd have to talk about. It's the furthest thing from our minds as we speak right now. We love our business. It's a very important part of a diversified portfolio that served us so well through the last economic downturn, while our Tools business was down 15% to 20% on an organic volume basis, and not quite as much in terms of earnings because we took out some cost. The Security business stayed flat in terms of volume, increased in terms of earnings and it's what makes us, we think, a reliable and a valuable diversified industrial company. That's the place we want to be and our board wants us to be. But every year, we go through a strategic planning exercise with our board. It's one of the things we talk about. Right now, Security is as I'd say, 25% going to about 32% of our revenue with Niscayah. We love the business. We love having it as part of our portfolio, and we're always open to considering various alternatives. Securitas, I might add, and they've been public with this, had the same thought 5 years ago, a guarding business, a monitoring business and a residential security business, based upon 2 of the model but it didn't work very well for them. So it's not magic but if you take essentially high EBITDA multiple business and spit it out and put it on its own, that you've created wealth overnight due to financial engineering. If it was that simple and straightforward, we have an incredibly capable and savvy Board of Directors, and I think a pretty good business development team and a lot of good financial advice, we would have done it 5 years ago. It didn't make sense then, doesn't make sense now, but it's certainly something, Sam, that we will always look at, always consider at the present time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Kim from Imperial Capital.
Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC: Specific to Convergent, you talked a little bit about installs being greater than RMR. Can you quantify how much stronger install was over RMR? And then with RMR specifically, was that primarily account growth or ARPU growth or is it split pretty evenly between those?
James Loree: Well, that's an incredible amount of granularity that you're asking for. What I will say is that the RMR or the install growth was a couple of points higher than the overall line average organic growth for CSS. So we're talking kind of in the 5% to 7% range. And it was largely derived from new account acquisition. And also, I think the RMR growth was also aided by the fact that our attrition rates are coming down as well and they're in a very good place as it relates to historical performance.
Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC: Okay. Great. And then you guys also called out some order strength from national accounts and a rebound in commercial. Can you talk a little bit about where you're seeing the vertical strength or are there any particular segments in the market that you're seeing some good activity?
James Loree: I think the state and municipal markets continue to be horrendous. I think we're seeing good in the multifamily, we're clearly seeing some positives. Education is stronger than it has been. Healthcare, slightly stronger. So we're -- that's kind of where we're seeing from a vertical perspective, the better performance. And the order rates are in excess of the install growth. So I mean, they're doing well from an order perspective and our job now is to convert that in the back half of the year.
John Lundgren: And Michael, I'll just add to that, because you'll get cut off, because it was your follow-up that's up. As you know -- you know our Security business so well. We're heavily skewed towards retail but working very hard to diversify into 6 other verticals that we're actively pursuing. Retail simply isn't getting much worse. It's been bad. It's hit bottom. And I'm not suggesting a rebound there, but to Jim's point, all the positives that Jim has talked about, which are modest but in the right direction, are not being offset to the extent by retail declines as they have been in the prior 4 or 5 quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Zener from Keybanc.
Kenneth Zener - Merrill Lynch: I wonder if you could, I thought it was interesting on in CDIY, obviously the difference between the Power Tools and the Hand Tools. So I'm wondering if you could maybe just expand on your comments about the relative difference. I know you mentioned the product launches were very impactful on the Power Tools side. But does that imply on the Hand Tool side, you were are gaining share or were you holding share in a market that was down that much? And if you wouldn't mind refreshing us, I know you addressed this at the capital markets day, but the introduction of the DeWalt hand tools, if you could kind of refresh us on why you don't think that will be a high rate of cannibalization towards the high-end Stanley hand tools that you might or might not have in the same channel?
James Loree: Sure. I'll take the first part of your question, for sure. It's Jim. I clearly believe that the overall market was negative, modestly negative for both Power Tools and Hand Tools in the quarter. And the reason I think that we had strong double-digit performance in Professional Power Tools and solid single-digit performance in Consumer Power Tools is primarily a result of the new product introductions and share gains in cordless that are derived from the 12-volt that we did last year and the 18-volt that we are just beginning to introduce now. So this is not surprising to us that we're performing well in this regard. We expect to continue to perform well. And so really, the market which was exacerbated by the weak European performance down, I'd say, a couple of points. And then with the hand tools and fastening number of minus 1%, probably would've been minus 2% to 3% had it not been for the revenue synergies that are being pursued, selling hand tools through power tool channels that existed with legacy Black & Decker, especially in Latin America but also in Europe now. So I think that's certainly a driver. And then of course, the DeWalt power -- hand tool line, which really didn't have a huge impact in the quarter, but I think we'll continue to see progress in -- as the year develops, and we take that across the U.S.
John Lundgren: And I'll take -- I'll just take the second part, on the cannibalization, which I think is a very logical question. Jim touched on it. Remember, DeWalt hand tools are available in one large big-bucks customer, primarily the staff [ph] channel. Stanley hand tools were significantly underdeveloped in the staff [ph] channel. That's why this was a tremendous revenue synergy opportunity to Jim's point and there's not much to cannibalize to be very candid, which is why that was the -- a; the product line, and b; the channel of focus on where we wanted to introduce this high-quality product with obviously a terrific brand name to support it.
Kenneth Zener - Merrill Lynch: Okay, I appreciate that. And for my follow-up, I'm not sure if you don't mind commenting on Niscayah. It's kind of Security in the U.S., which we are seeing more of a nascent recovery obviously on the Convergent side, less on the Mechanical side. But if one looks at the Niscayah business, which is a bit more on the install side than your existing business, I believe, it's seen pretty negative growth. I mean could you kind of, without getting into detail, but kind of describe your thoughts around how that installation versus the kind of the recurring market is occurring? And given recent changes that we've -- where pressure that we've seen on the European economy relative to the U.S. is more nascent commercial recovery?
James Loree: Ken, this is Jim again. The big difference between Niscayah and our business is they both have pretty strong recurring revenue. I think we're about 50%, they're about 40%, but only 10% of their revenue derives from monitoring and we're substantially higher than that, at least double that. And the monitoring business is by far and away the most profitable part of the recurring monitoring business. But the other recurring revenue is service revenue. And I would offer that, I think, Niscayah does a fantastic job signing up their customers for service. And I think we could learn from them actually in the U.S. and take some of what they're doing with respect to their contract service and leverage our service base even more effectively. I think that one of the problems that they have is that, given some of their historical constraints, they haven't been able to really size their service fleet in accordance with their level of demand. So there's opportunity all over the place for both Niscayah and for us to learn from each other and to make our entire enterprise even more profitable.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill: Just wondering if -- I'm sorry if I missed this, if you touched on this already, but can you just talk about how inventory management in some of your bigger customers have impacted results during the quarter or the outlook for the third quarter?
John Lundgren: Yes. Dennis, this is John. I think we've been pretty public and granular. Inventory is not at dramatically low levels, although our data tells us that at the larger customers, we won't name any by name, we're down about 1.5 weeks from historical level and that's arithmetic. That did have an adverse impact, particularly in our HHI channel, and to a modest extent, in hand tools. We're not going to go through inventory by SKU or by product line, but in general, as you know, we get good TOS data from our 7 largest customers, and we get it almost realtime. And we're down about 1.5 weeks from what I think we would agree with our customers are historically optimal levels. To the extent, they keep it there. That won't come back, to the extent, they rebuild. There'll be a little bit of a lift in the second half. We've built no lift based on inventory rebuild into our forecast because we think our customers, just as we do, are getting better managing their supply chains with a little less inventory. We know, historically, when it went from about 12 to 8 weeks, they were out of stocks all over the place. That was neither good for vendors or customers. But to think over time, retail inventories could come down a week or so, which is 8%. Of course, it varies a lot by category. And turns would increase and out-of-stocks wouldn't. That's quite feasible. And so we've built no lift into the numbers going forward. But it clearly did have an impact in the first half of the year, in general, and the second quarter in particular.
Dennis McGill: Okay. And then just -- that's is very helpful, John. Just to be clear then though, the 1.5 weeks, roughly, would also be down versus the year-ago period?
John Lundgren: That's -- yes. Our best estimate is yes. 1 to 1.5 weeks across the big bucks is going to [indiscernible] . That's right.
Dennis McGill: Okay. And then just one follow-up on a comment you made earlier about Outdoor. I think you said it's $500 million to $600 million business. Does that include the legacy BDK, cleaning and lighting and some of the household products or was that strictly the Outdoor category?
John Lundgren: Yes. It's all of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG: I just wanted to clarify the comments that you made on pricing. I think it was probably the first question on the call. You said that -- it sounds like your getting a little bit of pushback from your CDIY customers, and I'm a little bit confused because I thought that, that was all unrecovered inflation. And so, I'm not sure why they'd be pushing back? So just -- if you could clarify that comment.
Donald Allan: It's not like we're getting pushback, Nicole, what it is is that -- there was the profits just continual discussion on data and information sharing, trends that happen in inflation on a daily basis gets discussed. So we're at the later stages of these discussions, but it's relatively small amounts we're referring to that haven't been finalized at this point.
James Loree: And frankly, we have no choice but to finalize them. So we've implemented the price increases across the rest of the channels so that they will come at the home centers and we will work through that.
John Lundgren: And I think, Nicole, just another point, we talked about inflation abating. It's true. To Don's point, as they ask for more data and we provide it, most folks are focusing on steel which is, without question, the biggest single commodity with which we deal, resins' import, et cetera. But if anybody has looked at rare earth metals lately, they're up 600%, 700%. Now, that being said, they're a tiny piece of costs, but it's important as it relates to power tools. And our customers understand that because they source those products directly themselves. So to Don's point, the data's there to support the increases. What Jim said is absolutely right, we can't have 3 sets of prices in the marketplace, so we either raise the prices or don't ship. And we've been here before and we don't expect much of a fallout from where we are.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. That's really helpful. For my follow-up, Industrial margins, on an incremental basis, came in at about 20%. It's a little bit lower than we've seen recently. Is there anything to call out there?
James Loree: Are you saying on a contribution margin basis?
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG: Yes.
James Loree: Yes. Well, we are investing in the business, so contribution margin is one way to look at it, but that assumes that SG&A is steady-state and that's just not the case. We're -- in the Industrial business, we're investing in new products. You're going to see an absolutely stunning new air tool introduction, the first industrial power tool -- air tool that will be introduced here in the next few weeks, in about 15 years in the industry. So just -- those types of things are going on. And we're spending money on advertising and sales promotion and working the emerging markets aggressively. So you can't just take the contribution margin of that. Some of that has to fuel growth.
John Lundgren: This is a dynamic business.
Operator: Our next question is from Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: I guess the first question on Security, I just want to make sure I understand the profitability here. Up 250 bps x acquisitions, which I consider to be pretty strong especially on the Mechanical side where organic growth was down one point, I think you pointed out. So I'm just wondering what the levers are in that Mechanical business. My guess is that profitability there actually improved even though organic was down. Am I kind of on the right track there? And then, just kind of what led to that?
John Lundgren: Yes. I guess I'll start, Todd -- Pete. It did improve but I'd like to feel better about it. We predicted it. It improved from an extraordinarily low base in the first quarter, which Don -- I don't think could have been more clear to say we considered it an aberration. We said what we thought contributed to it, specifically, a lot of softness in MAS and the mechanical locking subsegments of the business. And it isn't so much that second quarter was terrific. Second quarter was a terrific improvement off a low base and quite frankly, we felt sanity was restored to our margins rather than we did something special.
Donald Allan: And you are seeing the impact of the Black & Decker Stanley integration in the mechanical business as we integrate HHI into our commercial locking business. You're starting to see the synergy effect really this year and it'll continue into next year. We didn't have a lot of that last year.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And so the implication is the second half should -- we should continue to see the improvement in mechanical if you're not kind of putting for par in that business, to use an analogy I guess?
John Lundgren: That's a perfect analogy. Pros putting for pars and dogs chasing cars, don't last very long in...
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: On the CDIY business, I just want to make sure I understand the organic growth forecast for the second half. 4% to 5%, can you give us a breakdown of price versus volume?
James Loree: Well, we're not going to give that level of detail, but there definitely will be 1 point or 2 of price in the mix. And then beyond that, it's going to be volume driven.
Donald Allan: The whole company will add about a point of price in the back half of the year. That's going to be the best way to look at it. Yes.
John Lundgren: And CDIY is about 80% of the inflation. So you can figure out where the pricing action is most aggressive.
Operator: Our last question comes from Mike Wherley from Janney Capital Markets.
Michael Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: This is Mike Wherley, standing in for Jim Lucas. I just had a follow-up on the Security business. You said that -- I was just wondering about the productivity gains. Are they more from SSDS or spread more evenly across the segment and part of that BDK integration you were talking about?
James Loree: They're across both CSS and MAS. And as I said, when I gave my comments, there were 3 principal factors that drove the earnings growth in security. One of them was synergies, one of them was productivity projects and the last one was SG&A control. Those are the 3 things that drove the profit growth.
Michael Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Okay. And then was there any change to your full year material inflation recovery forecast of 33% to 50% that you gave us last quarter?
Donald Allan: No. We're still on track for the 80% in the second half and the 33% to 50% for the full year.
Kathryn White: Thanks all. This concludes our call today. Again, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions about any sort of matter, and thank you so much for coming in today.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

John Lundgren: Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody. If you will take a look at the presentation posted to the website, I'd like to first summarize some of the first quarter highlights that we experienced. Then I will say, as Kate has pointed out, this is the last quarter where we'll provide -- feel the need to provide as much pro forma data from the second quarter forward. Everything will be quite clean. As a reminder, the transaction with Black & Decker closed on March 12, 2010, so there are a couple weeks of Black & Decker performance included in the GAAP measures. And from second quarter onwards, it'll be clean. It'll be more clear. But we think the pro forma comparisons are most helpful to you in understanding our business. Revenues increased 9% on a pro forma basis to -- up 9%; on a pro forma basis, $2.4 billion; organically, up 4%. Strong growth in emerging markets, particularly Latin America. We had some great share gains. New products are doing well. Jim Loree is going to talk about that in the segment breakdown. And certainly, some successful implementations of the first signs of some positive growth from our revenue synergy plans. Diluted EPS was $1.08 reflecting a significantly favorable tax rate. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.92. Per the press release, the tax rate contributed about $0.12 to earnings relative to our planned rate. I'll come on to that again in just a sec. Free cash flow of $61 million was up $24 million versus the prior year. That excludes the $37 million of merger-related payments.  As a reminder, we increased our dividend 21% in February, and we've announced a $250 million share repurchase program that will begin in the second quarter. That $250 million program, when completed, will consume less than half of the $7.8 million authorization that's still outstanding. And I think it's important at this stage, Don will spend more time on it, but to be clear, the purpose is simply to avoid creep. Our stock is up 16% year-to-date, almost 30% on a 6-month basis and 80% since we announced the merger. The guidance we provided in our plans were for average share count during 2011 of approximately 170 million shares. As options have been exercised, that creep would drive us up to above 175 million shares. So with the repurchase, our current best estimate would be about 172 million shares is our share count, which is 2 million shares higher, even including the repurchase program, than was assumed and provided when Don provided our initial guidance for the 2011 year. That's hopefully will be helpful to you in your modeling. Commodity inflation headwinds continue to persist. We think they'll peak in the second quarter based on everything we know, and we'll recover 80% of that or more, be it pricing, in the second half as many of the price increases that we've already negotiated will take effect late in the second quarter and early in the third quarter. 2011 guidance, as a consequence, has increased to the range of $5 to $5.25 due to the tax rate favorability that I discussed. So far so good on the integration. And if we could flip to Page 5, I think it is important because the integration remains our top priority. So I think an update on where we stand is relevant for this morning's call. Our Steering Committee and our major footprint review group continued to meet regularly. We're looking at $165 million of realized synergies this year in calendar 2011. And in the first half of '11, we completed the end of a refresh process including all new opportunities, some of that we discussed on our analyst day, but we constantly monitor and update it formally on a monthly basis. In the first half of '11, several major footprint-related projects will have been either launched or completed. We obviously don't talk about them in advance to the -- publicly or make no disclosure until Works Councils, if it's in Europe, or employees, if it's in the U.S., have been notified and consulted. Some of those programs are underway, for instance, our Rock Falls distribution center consolidation, and some are behind us in Jackson, Tennessee. The others, we'll update you as appropriate, but no public disclosure on exactly which facilities are involved as is our policy and that just makes good business sense. We will have completed some of those consolidation this year. And by the end of year, we will have executed programs that represent almost 75% of our 2011 cost savings of $425 million, which as Don has pointed out, represents $460 million on an annualized basis in terms of cost synergies. And finally, revenue synergies remain -- the opportunities remain encouraging, and they're going to contribute about 50 basis points of growth already in 2011. Moving on to a look at our business by geography. Our largest market, of course, being the U.S., which accounts for 53% of our volume, was relatively flat. There were a lot of puts and calls that I won't talk about because Jim is going to go into it in more detail, with our Industrial & Automotive Repair platform, up; Mechanical Security, Hardware & Home Improvement, down; others, relatively stable.  Second-largest market, being Europe, with tremendous performance across the board, particularly in our Industrial & Automotive Repair platform as well as our Engineered Fastening business. Latin America, really strong growth. While it only accounts for 8% of our combined volume, that number will continue to grow. And as you see, growth in essentially every geography in the country and as the successful execution of revenue synergy plans continues. Looking at earnings on Page 7. As we reported, the $1.08, up 54% on a GAAP basis, excluding the $37 million of merger-related charges, which, of course, was a much larger number in the prior year. As mentioned in our press release and as shown at the bottom, underneath the bars, it was helped $21 million or about $0.12 from tax.  And as I think you all know, historically, we, and all other publicly listed companies, would estimate spread and then reconcile any tax settlements or tax reserves that we held. We're now required to report them, only when the audits are completed and fully settled, which regrettably makes for a very lumpy quarter-to-quarter tax rates. There is absolutely nothing we can do about it. It's an SEC requirement. We'll try to live with it, and we'll try to provide the best guidance we can. And Don will have a little more flavor on that as -- later on this morning. So the earnings were up. Volume leverage, cost synergies, favorable tax rate all helped. I've talked to the share count and what we think of the modest repurchase program we'll do to that share count. And Don will touch on it a little later in his guidance.  Looking at our sources of growth. I think, first and foremost, volume, up about 7% on the legacy Stanley side, which is helpful. Pricing was, again, with some puts and calls, by business was flat. Currency helped us 2% on a GAAP basis this quarter. And of course, acquisitions, overwhelmingly, Black & Decker and then several minor acquisitions that Jim will talk about, their impact and their influence on our revenues in the segment breakdown gave us an 89% lift in revenue.  Looking at legacy Stanley, legacy Black & Decker, just very, very quickly. Hand tools, fastening and power tools, essentially our CDIY segment, the legacy Black & Decker portion up 4%. Good movement on power tools. And as pointed out in the press release, hand tools and fastening was essentially flat. Nice performance on the 12-volt lithium ion introduction, which is really giving us a lot of traction in the marketplace.  We talked about Pfister and the loss of a significant number of SKUs in the line review early in the year, the impact that that's had on volume in the home centers. The Industrial segment, including the former Emhart or Engineered Fastening business, both those businesses showed great momentum as suggested. IAR plus -- and Infrastructure, plus 17%. And the legacy Black & Decker Industrial business, which is primarily Emhart up 12%. Security and HHI, again, legacy Stanley, up 4%. On the legacy BDK side, down 12%. The suggested Kwikset has performed extraordinarily well for the last 12 to 24 months. There was some meaningful inventory correction at the big-box customers in the first quarter, which did have a negative impact on Kwikset. We still feel very good about that business and its future prospects in the marketplace. So in total, we see the legacy Stanley business up at 6%, legacy Black & Decker business up 2% with lots of puts and calls.  Let me turn it over to Jim Loree, who's going to give you some more flavor on the performance within our 3 major reporting segments.
James Loree: Thanks, John. Let's start with CDIY. CDIY had a solid quarter in line with our expectations, except for the loss of some Pfister business that John talked about at a major customer, which is unfortunate but not surprising given the inherent challenges of that product line. I'll come back to that in a moment. Total CDIY segment sales were $1.211 billion, up 2% on a pro forma basis and up 3%, excluding Pfister, and up 4%, excluding Pfister and the exits of the various small Delta stationary and consumer auto electronics product lines. So really, when you cut through some of the dispositions or nonstrategic elements of the performance, a real nice solid 4% growth.  Power tools were up 4%. They really drive the segment, up 6%, taking the exits into account. Professional power tools were very strong with continued success in the 12-volt lithium ion program. And consumer products was flattish with solid power tools sales offset by some timing issues in outdoor between 1Q and 2Q; a few premerger SKU losses, some of which have been recouped already in anniversary in the third and fourth quarters; and the effect of the exits as previously mentioned. All of that was as expected. On a regional basis, Latin America remained a highlight, up 22% and up 19% with -- excluding the effect of FX. North America, up 5% without the exits. And excluding Pfister, the profit rate was up 90 basis points including, as you see on the chart, up 50 basis points to the 13.1% as the cost synergies and the volume kicked in and partially offset by unrecovered inflation, some of which will be recovered in the fourth quarter we expect.  Let me address Pfister for a moment. Back on March 3 at our Analyst Day, Jim Lucas, from Janney Montgomery Scott, asked a question and we answered it. The question was, are there other potential divestitures down the line, any, either in product lines or brands that are sticking out that are not -- don't have the potential to be #1 or #2? And I answered that question by saying, there's nothing really glaring except, I would say, in the HHI business, which is where we manage Pfister out of -- although it's reported externally in CDIY.  We have this thing called Pfister. And Pfister for us, we have to make a decision about whether we invest in that particular plumbing products, product line or whether we divest. And it's a strategically challenged business in the sense that a lot of what it produces or sells is actually sourced. They do a lot of the design work and it has a fashion element to it as well, which is not something that we love, and it's very concentrated with a few customers.  So it reminds me a little bit of the home decor business that some of you long-time followers will remember. It's a very good business if you look at the industry. There are definitely examples of companies that make a lot of money in plumbing products, but it would take a lot of effort. And so right now, we don't have the resources to put that effort into it. But we also don't have the appetite, as we sit here today, to do all the work that it would take to actually dispose of it.  So right now, we're in kind of a maintain mode. We'll see what the future brings. We've asked the team that runs Pfister to do everything they can to fix the strategic challenges associated with that business. And if they do it, it will only make it more valuable if we choose to later dispose of it. And if they don't, it will make the decision a lot easier. So when you step back from Pfister, it is a roughly $200 million business. It has 2% share of the global plumbing market. It's #5 in the U.S. with 8% to 10% share behind Moen and Delta, KOHLER and American Standard, all formidable competitors. And so the strategic challenge starts there. And then we add to that the sourced aspect of greater than 50% sourced, greater than 50% concentrated in U.S. home centers, and it's tendency to be a fashion business. So the challenges are obvious, and it's probably more valuable to others than it is to us. And the only reason we still own it is that disposition would be a distraction, with the integration going on.  So the loss in the first quarter of $50 million of annualized business was unexpected in terms of timing but not surprising. And we have to deal with Pfister on an ongoing basis, and we will. I'll finish my comments on CDIY with some thoughts on the second quarter. I think we can expect a pretty good sequential bounce in the organic growth rate in the 2Q even with the exits and the Pfister drag. Organic growth should be between 5% and 10% in this segment as new product introductions, even more new product introductions, and customer programs gain steam, the revenue synergies take hold and the timing issues between one and Q -- 1Q and 2Q work themselves out. So we're very excited and enthusiastic about what the second quarter should bring for CDIY. Moving now to Industrial. Industrial had a super quarter with sales increasing to $613 million, up 105% versus the first quarter of '10. The addition of a full quarter of Emhart and CRC provided acquisition growth, and legacy Industrial grew a very robust 17%, organically. On a pro forma basis, Emhart grew a solid 12% despite exposure to the Japanese auto industry, which production was down 27% in the quarter. And pro forma operating profit was up 400 basis points to 17.5%, incredibly strong performance from a margin rate and growth perspective, and strong operating leverage is evident here. In the Industrial & Automotive Repair business, sales volumes were up double digits across all regions due to market share gains in North America and Europe as well as strength in all major industrial distribution channels. And we note that revenue synergies kicked in, in the industrial and mobile distribution channels in North America with DEWALT products being sourced through those channels. And in the second quarter, DEWALT products, power tool products, will be launched to industrial channels in Europe, and the early signs are encouraging there. Now that's about a third of the segment.  The second third of the segment is Engineered Fastening, which is the legacy Black & Decker Emhart business. They had a terrific performance as well with their pro forma revenue up 18% due to additional penetration with their existing customer base and some vehicle production increases in the Americas and Europe. However, this performance was against the backdrop of 4% growth in global auto production. And they do have about $200 million of exposure to the Japanese market, and they're dealing with the headwinds from that and dealing with them very effectively, especially with the added growth in China that we're experiencing.  The Infrastructure segment, which is our subsegment, which is the last third of the Industrial segment, includes Hydraulics and CRC-Evans. CRC-Evans had a respectable quarter. Revenues were up 8%, organically, and Hydraulics had a terrific performance with their revenues up 49% leveraged by the strong steel scrap market. So in total, a welcome outperformance by our Industrial team, which helped to offset the Pfister issue in the quarter. Moving to Security. Security had a mixed quarter with pluses and minuses. The biggest plus of all was the organic growth in Convergent. At last, some of you might think as do we. The SSDS business in France, integration going well. The performance was super, and the Healthcare business, the core Healthcare growth platform, showed solid organic growth and profitability growth. On the minus side of the ledger, we had weak demand, market demand, in Mechanical Access. We had a sizable inventory correction in HHI, and we had to deal with inflation ahead of price increases. The latter of which was expected and not a surprise. The overall sales in the segment increased 17% to $557 million. Acquisitions were 12 points of the increase, and organic growth was accounted for 4 points. It was a tale of two businesses with the CSS resurgence and the 8% organic growth in the HHI legacy Black & Decker business down 12% on the inventory corrections. And as John mentioned, the underlying Kwikset business remains very, very healthy. Just to highlight a few facts on CSS. The revenue from both installations and RMR grew in the quarter, which was very encouraging, especially given that installations increased 10% and RMR increased 3%. And as I mentioned, the organic sales were strong in Healthcare. They were up 5%. For this quarter, we added a chart to help clarify the margin performance, and if we could turn to that. This chart shows the Security margin rate walk on a year-over-year basis, this time starting with a pro forma 1Q '10, which happens to be the same as the legacy Stanley, with a little Black & Decker mixed in last year after March 12, but it is the same, 16.3%. And this chart will walk you then to the 13.9%.  And we start with the impact of volume and inflation in HHI, which totaled 2.4 points. That's the first yellow bar to the right of the 16.3%. That was split between volume of 1.0 points and inflation of 1.4 points. Next was the impact of acquisitions, dilutive to the rate by 1.4 points. Then legacy MAS inflation accounted for 0.9 points of headwind, and mix in the CSS business, within the CSS business, and legacy MAS accounted for minus 0.7 point effect. That was roughly split equally between the RMR and install mix effect within CSS and weaker retrofit sales versus new construction in the legacy MAS business. Now all of that totals about 5.4 points of headwind, which was a pretty dramatic headwind within the quarter in the Security segment, but it was partially offset by a really strong performance in synergies and productivity, which provided a 3.0-point benefit. And thus, you get to the 13.9%.  Now of the headwinds, we think that about 5 points or so of the 5.4 were really, simply, timing related. So for instance, the HHI volume, which accounted for 1.0 point was simply related to the inventory correction. As we said, the underlying business remains strong. Inflation accounted for 2.3 points when you take into effect both HHI at 1.4 and legacy MAS at 0.9, and that will be positively impacted by price increases in the latter part of the year. In fact, because of the increase in inflation, it's actually made the whole process of achieving price increases more pragmatic. And then finally, acquisitions, with a 1.4-point headwind, they will correct themselves over time as the integrations proceeds. So what could appear to be a more challenging story than it actually is, a lot of it's just related to timing. But I think this -- I hope this chart you'll find helpful to understand what's going on in the Security segment. On working capital, I'll just touch up on this briefly, it was a positive story. The turns improved 15% on a pro forma basis versus the prior year. There's really no dramatic improvement in the numbers yet, in terms of absolute numbers. I mean, over $100 million is a good start minus 6% year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, and moving from 4.6 to 5.3 turns. However, the key here is that the rollout of SFS and the implementation of that initiative is well underway, and we expect to see good progress here as the year goes on. And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan, which -- who will illuminate the financial aspects of this in a little more detail.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. And we start on Page 14, which is free cash flow for the first quarter of 2011. You can see that it excludes all the M&A charges or payments, which is about $11 million in the first quarter.  The working capital was a negative in the first quarter. So normal trends, historically, when you go back, both legacy companies have had a negative working capital performance in virtually all the first quarters of the last 10 years. And that's really just the trend of revenue as well as the aspect of building certain inventory levels for the spring season in several of the businesses. But the good news, from our perspective, is the relatively modest negative trend in working capital of $70 million. The other item of significance is other/restructuring. We had some significant timing of payments associated with various things, such as pensions and derivatives, that resulted in the $90 million negative. We do not see that as a repetitive issue. It's something that was onetime in nature in many cases.   Moving down to capital expenditures, about 2.9% of revenue in the first quarter. So slightly above the guidance range we provided of 2.5% to 2.8% for the year. However, we still believe that range makes sense on an annualized basis. It's more of a timing aspect to it. The end result was $61 million of free cash flow in the first quarter versus $37 million last year. So a $24 million improvement, and in line with what our expectations were for the first quarter. And we reiterate our guidance of $1.1 billion free cash flow for the year of 2011. I'd like to spend a little bit of time on the next page because inflation is such a relevant topic to us and many other companies. And this is a page that I presented at our Investor Day back in March, and the focus is on the pricing center of excellence.  As many of you know, we have been very active in pricing actions and have implemented many of them, and we'll continue to do that as we go forward. There's two different aspects to it. There's one related to reacting to the changing cost structures, such as inflation drives in our business and how you respond with price increases to your customers. And then the second piece is more of a longer-term pricing alignment with the value that you deliver to your customers and making sure that your products are appropriately priced. Clearly, in the timeframe that we are right now in the short term, we're very focused on the inflation we are experiencing in commodities and how we pass that on price to our customers. We established the center of excellence back in 2004, over 7 years of experience, and we've gone through -- this is our third inflationary cycle that we've gone through since that started. We have 10 different business consultants that are focused on the analysis that needs to be done, which is really providing the data to our customers, so they understand the reasons for the price increases and why they're needed. We also have additional finance resources embedded in our major business units to assist in driving this analysis and sharing the facts that are appropriately put on the table in these discussions. As a result, we have over 100 years of pricing experience with all these individuals in our company. And they're really focused on training and coaching and mentoring our business units through a process like this to ensure that we're passing on inflation appropriately to our customer base. As we indicated at the beginning of the year, we believe this year in 2011 we can recover 1/3 to 1/2 of the inflation through price increases. And in particular, as you hear about in a few minutes and as John has mentioned earlier on, we expect that recovery actually to be 80% in the back half of 2011 because of the recovery in the first half, due to timing, is relatively low. So with that, I'd like to move the Page 16, which is an update of our outlook for 2011. First of all, as indicated previously, our earnings guidance, we raised from $5 to $5.25 versus our previous guidance range of $4.75 to $5. The main driver of that is the tax rate, where our tax rate now, we believe, will be between 20% and 21% from the previous range, which was 25% to 26%. As John indicated, there's definitely a little pressure associated with share creep, and the average outstanding shares we're projecting to be 172 million for the year. So that's slightly offsetting some of that tax benefit in our new guidance range. The other thing that I want to touch on is when you look at the timing throughout the year of our earnings per share, there will be significant inflation impact in the first quarter and in the second quarter. And as a result, our EPS for the year and the percentage first half versus second half will be 45% and 55%. So what that means is in the first half of 2011, we believe, when you take our annual guidance, about 45% of that will occur in that timeframe, because of the timing of the inflation and the price recovery as well as the timing of additional tax settlements that are expected later this year. Digging in a little deeper into inflation, as I mentioned, the 1/3 to 50% recovery, which is causing that 100 basis point negative drag on our operating margin that we discussed back in January. If you look at the timing by quarter, we believe that we will see about $40 million of a net negative impact in the second quarter as many of those price increases will be put in place in late June and early July, as John indicated, which results, though, in the back half of the year of seeing us 80% price recovery on inflation. So we really begin to see the impact in the back half of the year, and then net negative is only $20 million for the entire second half of 2011. John touched on the share repurchase of $250 million, which is really trying to partially offset the share creep that we expect to experience and have experienced, getting to that average outstanding share number of 172 million. So those are the major changes in our guidance.  We are reiterating, to the right side of the slide, many of the operational components that we reviewed back in January, such as: net organic sales are expected to increase 5% to 6% on a pro forma basis off a pro forma level of $9.3 billion for 2010; the revenue synergies will add an incremental 50 basis points of revenue to that number with a modest EPS impact, as previously disclosed; the acquisitions of CRC-Evans, SSDS, GMT and InfoLogix will add about 3% growth to that pro forma base; our cost synergies are still anticipated to be $165 million in 2011; and our operating margin rate is expected to expand by 150 basis points or just over 14% for 2011. The one thing that I want to point out that may be lost in a little bit of various different changes here is that our Pfister business, as discussed by Jim, had a negative performance and lost some significant SKUs with a major customer. That's about a $50 million revenue impact for the year and about $25 million negative operating margin impact for the year. We're offsetting that with stronger performance in Industrial and a little bit in our CDIY business or hand tool and power tool businesses. So we were able to absorb that negative impact with outperformances in other parts of the portfolio to maintain our operational guidance numbers. And then the last thing I'd indicate is the non-merger and acquisition-related restructuring is still expected to approximate 2010 levels. So moving to the next page, a little bit more discussion around the segments as we look forward to the remainder of the year. Starting with CDIY. We still believe that we will see mid-single digit pro forma organic revenue growth. Jim gave you a little indication for 2Q and some of the nice growth rates we're expecting there, but the year is still anticipated to be strong in this particular area.  We will see operating margin headwinds in the second quarter from inflation, as I just discussed, as a lot of the inflation price recovery is in our CDIY business. The operating margins headwind in 2Q will also be impacted by the promotional spend as we disclosed back in January of this year and the timing of that versus lower levels of promotional spend in the second quarter of 2010. We're seeing really strong revenue growth performances across the globe in CDIY as Latin America will continue to outpace many of the other areas, as we really expand our hand tools presence down there through the existing Black & Decker infrastructure. The share gains are going to continue as we see robust product pipeline for 2011 across many of the business units. So we feel very good about the prospects of our CDIY business this year and going forward. Security. We believe that we will see low single digit pro forma organic revenue growth this year. We did -- I did indicate back in January that we expected a relatively slow performance from a top line perspective in the first part of 2011, which we did experience in Q1. It was a flat revenue performance overall. We believe that will continue to improve, and as a result, we'll see a low single-digit revenue story for 2011.  The good news, from our perspective, is CSS organic sales are strong. They were very strong in the first quarter. We believe that will continue. We will see a bit of a mix impact from installations versus RMR as we saw in Q1, but we don't expect that impact to be very significant to operating margin for the full year. We're very focused on productivity and pricing synergies and some additional costs actions in our MAS business to offset some of the operating pressures that we're seeing there from inflation and a little bit of lower volumes. So we're very focused on making sure that we're maintaining our operating margins across the Security segment and improving them from the levels we saw in Q1. Industrial. Fantastic performance in Q1, as Jim reviewed with you. We believe we will see a mid-single digit pro forma organic revenue performance for 2011. That may seem conservative to many of you, based on a 14% performance in Q1, but we do have to recognize that the comps, the comparisons get very difficult starting in Q2. As in Q2 of last year, we began to see some significant growth across this segment. So as a result, we believe we'll likely see mid-single-digit growth for the entire year. The Industrial & Automotive Repair tool business continues to exceed market growth, and we feel very good about the prospects for that across the year. The Emhart business, as Jim mentioned, definitely had some challenges associated with Japan, but the good news here is that production continues to be forecasted as strong in U.S. and China and in Europe, in certain cases. And we believe that stronger performance will be able to offset any of the negative performance we see in Japan as they begin to ramp up production throughout the quarter and throughout the year. So in summary, I like to just wrap up the presentation portion of our call today and reinforce five different points. The integration continues to proceed with success. We're very much focused on that. That is our top priority. The cost synergies are on track and in line with our $165 million objective for 2011, which will really drive a lot of that 150-basis-point operating margin expansion for this year. The inflation headwinds are real. We all know that. But our actions are swift, and we're trying to focus on recovery and have many things in place, at this point, that will go into increases in price in June and July of this year, which will result in that 80% price recovery in the back half of 2011. The revenue synergies are off, and they're progressing smoothly and yielding nice results, particularly in emerging markets like Latin America and also within our Industrial portfolio. We're very focused on SFS and rolling that across the company. And that will continue to be a cultural penetration throughout 2011 and, of course, beyond. And then last, but certainly not least, $1.1 billion of free cash flow is forecasted for 2011 as we really see the cash begin to generate from this great merger that happened a little more than a year ago. Our acquisition pipeline is robust, as we've indicated before, but our integration continues to remain our top priority.
Kate White Vanek: Thank you so much, Don. Teresa, we'll now open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jason Feldman. [UBS Investment]
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank: A quick question on price cost. The basic expectation is unchanged. But in March, I think you said you didn't expect to get back to an 80% cost recovery level, actually, for a couple of years. What's going to change to make you more optimistic about the second half? And does this imply kind of that the first half is going a little bit more slowly than expected?
Donald Allan: Jason, it's Don. I would say there's a few dynamics happening here. First of all, we've had two waves of inflation associated with commodities over the last 6 to 8 months. We had a wave back in third, fourth quarter of last year, and then we had a significant second wave in February-March timeframe of this year. The fact that we had the additional wave, and it increased the negative impact of inflation to us, actually allowed us to have a more pragmatic factual discussion with our customers based on more significant inflation levels, which allowed us to get many of these price increases in place or they will be in place in June and July of this year. So really, it had to do with the timing of it and those two different waves. And the more inflation that you tend to have in one of these cycles, the more factual robust discussions you have with your customers and your ability to implement price increases. I wouldn't say it's easier, but it's a little less difficult when you're dealing with lower inflationary numbers.
Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, got it. And for power tools, specifically, obviously, very good results in the quarter. Do you have a sense of how much was related to share gains as opposed to market growth? And has you also seen changes in the competitive environment given what's going in Japan Techtronic's and Makita's position in those markets? We've kind of heard they're shipping less to the U.S. given the demand there for the tools.
James Loree: Yes. Well, this is Jim. The one thing I would say about the market growth is it's pretty soft in Europe and the market and in North America. And by soft, I mean, if you look at point of sale at the big boxes or the merchants, mass merchants, to see a positive POS is a good day for the total markets. So I think what we're seeing is kind of a sluggish bumping-along-the-bottom kind of market. And a couple of points have outperformance on share, in the power tools, and it's mainly the cordless, where I think that's occurring, and mainly in the 12-volt area.
John Lundgren: Jason, this is John. Your last piece on product coming from Japan, stay tuned and watch. You're well aware that the travesties and tragedies in Japan took place very late in the quarter. Any U.S. shipments or POS were already here. The supply chain is longer than that. So any impact from Japanese producers shipping to the U.S., as a result of the difficulties in Japan, would not have shown up in first quarter numbers. To the extent they exist, they'll take place in the second quarter.
James Loree: And I think you will also find that Japan power tool production tends to go to Japan, although there are some export. But most of the power tool production that comes to the U.S. is probably from China, even if it's a Japanese company. So their plants themselves have not -- we've studied the locations of their plants, and the plants haven't been impacted. The final finished goods plants haven't been impacted in any significant way from what we can tell, but we don't know to what extent their supply chain might've been impacted. We know that ours is pretty much unharmed with a one or two little, very, very small immaterial items here and there. You probably can count them on one hand. But as the Japanese companies might have a little bit more tendency to have Japanese subcomponent suppliers, and that's what we'll really have to see in the second and third quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim. [Credit Suisse]
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk a bit more about Kwikset. You talked about the inventory correction there. Where do you think the inventories are at this point? Do you think it's fully done in terms of correction? And just how are you looking at that in terms of the sales environment there?
John Lundgren: Yes, I don't think we can provide anymore direction, Dan, than we already have, specifically, inventories were too high. They were corrected, and we think they're right about where they need to be at this stage, which is why -- I worry about a lot of things, but this is not one of them. As Jim described, we really do think it was temporary. This business has performed, the Kwikset business, extraordinarily well over the last 18 months in terms of both POS, customer acceptance and performance in the marketplace. And as you know, home center inventories are always depleted in the month of January due to their fiscal reporting, and reorders took place later in the quarter than we anticipated. But that's a long way of saying we think they were a little high. They probably got a little low by the time the quarter was over, and we think they're pretty much in line with where they need to be given our customers' projections and our projections on demand going forward.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG: Great, thanks. And just a second question, wondering about the comment on commodity costs. You said you still expect the commodity costs to peak in the second quarter. Can you add a little, any color in terms of what's driving that, just in thinking about it for the second half of the year?
John Lundgren: Sure, I'll start. And Don, Jim and I are also extraordinary close to the pricing center of excellence and our global commodities sourcing team. I think we're probably all equally attuned to respond. If you think about the commodities that affects us the most, primarily it's steel, then we get into the non-ferrous metals, resins, and now that we're in the power tool business in a big way, batteries. But it's still far less of an issue than steel, non-ferrous metals and resins. We've seen pricing out through essentially the third quarter. So as Don made the reference, and it was a very good one, when there was very modest inflation in the fourth quarter of 2010, we absorbed it or tried to with productivity because it was not enough to justify a price increase. When we got it the second time, dramatic increases, particularly in steel, it was enough to go and get the pricing. And as Don suggested, most of it -- that we've had the negotiations. It will go into effect in June or July, and we think that will offset, at least, Dan, what we've seen coming basically through September. Beyond that, we don't have prices. And obviously, our prices in the marketplace will be -- are pretty much set up until that time, and we think one will offset the other.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut. [JPMorgan]
William Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co: This is actually Will Wong in for Mike. Just a quick question regarding CRC-Evans. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about how that's backed up to your expectations this quarter, and also in terms of whether if you guys have seen any sort of weather impact on some of the operations at CRC-Evans.
John Lundgren: Well, we haven't seen any weather impact. I mean, the business, overall, I think is on track for what we expect for the year. It's a lumpy business. This quarter was not as robust as we would've liked, but it certainly was a solid quarter. We had 8% organic growth and low single-digit operating margins. So we're going to have to get used to the lumpiness of that business. I think we're all going to have to get used to it, especially when Infrastructure becomes a bigger part of the portfolio. But right now, we're more than happy with the integration the way it's going. I think the interesting thing, as nuclear becomes a little perceived as more risky in the wake of the Japan situation, I think natural gases and clean coal are basically the two areas that you're going to see a lot of interest in, in terms of helping supplement the energy base here in the U.S. And CRC strength is natural gas onshore North America, so we're right in the sweet spot if and when that takes off. In the meantime, the offshore business in CRC is a burgeoning area. I'd say, CRC brings more to the table in offshore and has a very small business there, but significant contracts have been signed in the last 3 to 4 months with the providers, major providers. And we really have a great value proposition. We see a lot of growth coming from that. So I think that CRC is going to live up to our expectations and maybe then some, but time will tell.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase. [Deutsche Bank]
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG: So first of all, if we could talk a little bit about the repurchase. What is the timing that you guys expected? Is this more of an accelerated repurchase that will occur in 2Q, or is this going to be balanced across the year? And then also, is there room to do more repurchases based on how the M&A pipeline looks right now?
Donald Allan: Nicole, it's Don. It's likely that the repurchase, the bulk of it, happens in 2Q, and I wouldn't expect it to go much beyond that. And as far as additional repurchase, I mean, John gave an indication that we have approval of about double the size of what we're doing. So we could certainly look at that as a possibility. We'll have to balance that against the pipeline. As I mentioned in the summary comment, the pipeline is robust. And combining that with the fact that a lot of our vast majority of our cash is overseas, we are looking at the utilization of that. And hopefully, through acquisitions, we can do that in particular. So I would imagine that some we'll continue to evaluate as we move throughout the year.
John Lundgren: Nicole, let me just -- to clarify. The repurchase for the third time is to avoid creep get our share count back in the 170 million to 172 million range where we guided at the beginning of the year, and it has zero to do with lack of a robust business development pipeline. As Jim has pointed out on numerous occasions, and I think it's important to reiterate, the integration of Black & Decker remains our highest priority. It's organizational capacity, not lack of opportunity, that will allow us to tread softly and be very thoughtful in terms of which types of acquisitions that we think we can pursue. We're very pleased to have a position, from a balance sheet perspective, to be able to pursue some meaningful acquisitions. But if it's the same people working on those acquisitions that are working on the integration, that will detract from our primary objective. So that is our biggest concern, staying focused on the integration of BDK. The pipeline's robust. As you're probably aware, we have full-time BD professionals on every continent and a very, very active group. It's just something we're spending less time on, short to intermediate term, because we are focused on the Black & Decker integration.
James Loree: Yes. And I'd also -- and this is Jim. At the analyst meeting, I mentioned that our expectations for acquisitive capital allocation in 2011 was nothing substantial in terms of multibillion dollars or billion dollar plus. I think I said probably around $0.5 billion would be our target for the year with maybe a little bit more, but that's kind of the range that we're thinking of here. And so if anybody is worried about a major multibillion dollar transaction, you could put that aside for the rest of this year, at least. They're certainly -- that's not going to happen.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, great. Thanks for color on that, guys. And then in the outlook, what are you guys embedding for FX? And what Euro rate are you using?
Donald Allan: We're utilizing the -- as far as FX, we utilized the latest rates, in the last week or so. That's what we utilized in our guidance. And so whatever the Euro is a week ago, $1.43 or $1.44, in that range, is what we've utilized.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG: And how much of a positive impact does that have on revenues in your outlook?
James Loree: Relative to what?
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG: Year-on-year?
James Loree: Oh, year-over-year? I think that's just like 1 to 2 points.
John Lundgren: 2% so far, Nicole. So our sense would be, unless we've missed something, that would be about 2% tailwind due to FX.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis McGill. [Zelman & Associates]
Dennis McGill: Thank you, guys. First question, just wanting to understand the creep a little bit more, because the $5 million, I think you mentioned, seems rather sizable relative to the $8 million of options that were exercisable at year-end. So can you kind of split that between new issuance and what's been exercised? And from the exercise component, everything you're laying out certainly points to a very strong market moving forward and results moving forward. So even when the stocks been strong, we certainly would hope that results continue to indicate stronger appreciation as we move forward. So can you maybe elaborate on where within the organization you're seeing those exercising?
Donald Allan: As far as the outstanding share creep question, the reality is, is that because of the rise in the stock price, it's not only the exercising of options, it's also the sudden impact of anyone who has options that are in the money. That has an impact on the shares outstanding and on a diluted basis. So as stock price goes up, it puts pressure on the number of outstanding shares as a result of that. And we also have -- you combine that with the fact that we do have certain tranches of options that we know will be expiring, from a vesting period perspective, later this year, which will likely result in many of those options being exercised. And so when we forecast that and look at it, it indicates possibility of $5 million -- 5 million shares of creep from the 170 million level to, potentially, 175 million. That's why we're looking at a share repurchase, which is about 3.3 million as John indicated, but it doesn't completely offset that potential creep. Now if all of those exercises don't happen, which would be unlikely, because if you have people's options expiring in a vesting period, they probably just wouldn't let them expire, they're going to exercise them. So as a result, we believe that's why 172 million makes sense.
Dennis McGill: Just to clarify in that point then, of the increase then, the vast majority of that is just timing of options that have already been issued as opposed to an new issue?
Donald Allan: Oh, yes.
John Lundgren: Absolutely.
Donald Allan: Not new shares that have been issues or new options. This is previously issued options.
Dennis McGill: Okay, perfect. And then the second question would just have to be around the pricing realizing there's a lot of focus here. Can you talk about, within the key power tools and hand tools area, have you seen announcements from competitors of similar magnitude? And if you had to think about the 80% recovery on a 1 to 10 scale, how confident are you in achieving that based on what you know today? Is there any uncertainty as we think about the back half of the year?
John Lundgren: The 80% is a back half number, which -- at the same time, inflation is abating, the price increases are kicking in. So our total price recovery is going to be far from 80% for the total year, quite a bit lower. And as far as competitive reaction, we are the market leader, so we have to go first in order for the rest of the competitors to make their decisions. And time will tell whether they follow or not. Frankly, our value proposition is so strong right now. We feel very confident that the price increases will stick. The discussions are underway. In some cases, commitments have been made. Agreements have been forged, in some cases. And we're not feeling terribly concerned right now about the willfulness of the channels to take the increases in general. Now we'll see what happens at the point of sale and whether competition follows. And we'll have to do whatever we do to protect our market share and just watch and observe and respond as circumstances unfold.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh. [Raymond James]
Joshua Wilson: John, Jim, Don, Kate, this is Josh filling in for Sam actually. I wanted to follow up a little bit on the last question with pricing in power tools. You talked about 80% realization overall. Could you maybe give us some sense of how much realization you're counting on in power tools given that's been historically a little tougher?
Donald Allan: This is Don. I would say that we're not going to, say, break it down by power tools and hand tools and Industrial businesses and Mechanical Security. But if you look at where we're experiencing inflation, the vast majority of it is in our Mechanical Security business, HHI business and CDIY and both CDIY hand tools and power tools. We do, as Jim indicated and I indicated, we do expect 80% price recovery in the back half. I don't see a significant deviations in businesses as a result of looking at each business component to that percentage. But you also have to recognize that for the year, we're only going to get 1/3 to 50% price inflation recovery. It's just the back half that we're experiencing. And if you look at previous cycles, there tends to be a period up front where you don't get the price recovery and then you get a higher percentage later on. But you rarely get to a point, across the whole cycle, where you fully recover all your inflation.
John Lundgren: And 30% to 50% for the portfolio would be at the very low end of our historical post-2004 inflationary era norm. So I think we're in a good place there.
Donald Allan: Exactly.
Joshua Wilson: Okay, I appreciate that. And then just a little bit of a modeling question with -- I appreciate the walk with the Security margins. Could you give us a sense of how you see those progressing as the year goes on and subsequent quarters?
Donald Allan: No, we don't tend to forecast operating margin percentage by segment. I think you can take the information that Jim presented. And he talked about things that he felt were temporary and things that he felt were permanent, and the vast majority of them were temporary. You can take that as an indication of the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Lucas. [Janney Montgomery Scott]
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: All right, thanks. No inflation question, but two on Security, please. Within CSS, with the installation growth, could you give a little more color of what verticals you're seeing that growth occur in? And then on the Mechanical side, where the legacy Stanley business has been a little choppy, any particular markets standing out? I mean, have we seen the bottom there?
James Loree: Well, in the CSS business, Jim, I think, without a doubt, it's the national accounts that we're gaining traction with. So it's the corporations and the very large commercial customers. What remains weak is municipalities and education. Government is modestly positive, although I'd say we're making good strides in government, from a share perspective, because we have a big initiative going on there. So that kind of breaks it down for CSS. Mechanical, oddly enough, the construction business is stronger than the retrofit business. But when you think about that in the context of education budgets being constrained in this environment and municipality budgets being constrained, I think it makes sense. We're not seeing any huge recovery in commercial construction. But I do think that there's a general feeling, with our people in Mechanical, that the construction market, whether it's our own execution or whether it's the market, that the volume has kind of firmed up a little bit there. And we're certainly not decreasing, I'd say, in the municipalities and education at this point in time. So it's really kind of a sluggish situation in Mechanical. We're talking the Best Access commercial, MAS, what we call, level. And I think we'll probably see a little bit of positivity, but not a whole lot. I think there are -- Electronics is going to carry the segment for the rest of years would be my guess.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: And any update on the retail channel of what you're seeing there?
James Loree: Retail channel, it's very -- but for the inventory corrections, it's very stable. It's a point or 2 of growth, that type of thing. Nothing dramatic, but certainly no downdraft going on. And it's just -- what we saw this quarter was a little resizing in the inventories.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: I was actually referring more to from construction versus retrofit?
John Lundgren: Yes, Jim. That remains slow, to be very candid. I mean, part of what we experienced in the second quarter was a large, very, very good customer delaying some retrofits and some store expansions. And a lot of competition in the retail space, on both the door and the locks side. So I guess the simple answer is that remains low. We think we've certainly have hit the bottom. But we'd like to see a little more robust activity in that, if you will, retail-end market or retail vertical as we refer to it, both for our Mechanical locking and our Access Technologies business. We have not seen it yet. And as you know well, having followed legacy Stanley, second and third quarters are normally the best quarters for that business due to a lot of work, no weather-related issues and just a lot more construction than normal. But it's still bouncing along the bottom, to be very candid.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard. [Cleveland Research]
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: One question. Jim, you talked about CDIY growing 5% to 10% in the second quarter, an acceleration from what you saw in the first quarter. Can you just give us a little more color in terms of what you see going on, and how much of that is end market or how much of that is new product or market share that's driving that improvement in 2Q?
James Loree: We're going to get a little end market, but I think it's going to be mostly ? Stanley, Black & Decker specific. We've got new product major initiative in hand tools through the DEWALT hand tools. We've got additional generations of power tool, product development that'll be introduced here as we go forward. We've got timing issues that affected the first quarter that won't repeat. We've got revenue synergies. I mean, everything's pointed in the right direction.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company: From an end market -- and I appreciate that. From an end market perspective or from a channel interest in supporting or promoting or bringing inventory in the category, is there any change within that?
James Loree: No, the customer receptivity is as strong as ever.
Operator: Our next comes question from Peter Lisnic. [Robert W. Baird]
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: I guess first question on the inventory, and just ignore HHI. Can you give us a sense in -- especially the power tools business, I would've expected maybe some pressure with inventory adjustment there, but may give us a sense as to what you're seeing in terms of sell-through there. Any inventory risk related to that business as you kind of look forward?
John Lundgren: Pete, this is John. I guess it would be naive to say there's no inventory -- there's inventory risk every day. We experienced it in HHI in the first quarter. But I think, simply said, what you're after, POS is in line with shipments and retail inventories across the board, to the best of our knowledge, and that's one area where we've really got good data, are totally in line with what we're used to seeing. Now there's a modest seasonal build because it's a busy season, but we see that there's nothing at retail to suggest a risk, in that regard, at this stage of the quarter.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay, perfect. And then just second question on the Infrastructure piece of Industrial. Understand that comps getting tougher, but from the global Infrastructure players and suppliers, that piece of the economy is certainly strong and maybe even strengthening. Can you give us a sense as to how your backlog in that piece of the business is evolving? And when you say sort of a tougher comps in the second quarter and second half, does that apply to that business specifically?
John Lundgren: Let me start, and then Jim will give you a little more detail. The Infrastructure piece of our portfolio is extremely small right now. It's $350 million annualized revenue. About 1/3 of that is legacy Stanley hydraulics and 2/3 is CRC, which Jim talked about our optimism in that business but the lumpiness of it. If you think about the third that we've got a lot of history on, there is a very, very close correlation between our backlog and our future projections and the price of scrap steel in our Hydraulics business. And as Jim referenced, scrap steels, very high, relative to historical levels right now, which would indicate our legacy Hydraulics business is in very, very good shape. CRC-Evans is newer to us. And as Jim indicated in the segment breakdown, it comes in bigger pieces on a less regular basis. And to be candid, we really don't have the history with that business to project it quite the way and too read as much into backlog, good or bad, as we would if this had been part of our portfolio for 5 or 6 years. Jim, you may want to elaborate.
James Loree: The only thing I would clarify in addition to that is that when Don referenced more difficult comps, on a prospective basis, he was really referring to the Industrial & Automotive Repair business, which has been booming since the second quarter of last year, as well as the Engineered Fastening business, which has also been extremely strong if you look over the last three quarters or so. That's what we're up against in Industrial is that the comps for IAR and for Emhart are both getting tougher. Hydraulics is not big enough to matter in the overall scheme of things.
Operator: Next question comes from Michael Kim. [Imperial Capital]
Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC: Just a quick follow-up on the Convergent Security business. With the step up in installations, how should we think about the pull on RMR through the balance of the year as we exit the year? And then, can you talk a little bit about maybe the pricing delta between the national accounts and your core commercial customers?
John Lundgren: I guess, two things. We are not going to get into detail on the pricing between national and core commercial. I just don't think it's appropriate on this call. As it relates to install and RMR, as Jim said, install is up 10%, RMR is up 3%. We've been saying, for about the last 18 months, that our margins have been flatter, for lack of a better word, or certainly helped by the fact that installs were so low. And as a consequence, RMR, as a percent of the total, is higher and our margins are higher. So the shift to install is growing at 3x the rate of RMR is not healthy, short term, in terms of margins. But I think as we've alluded to all along, we feel very, very good about it because you know well, without those installs, the future RMR won't be there. Historically, we've had a tremendous national account focus. I will say that much. And the small -- the local or small- to medium-sized enterprises, as we refer to them, offer a great opportunity for us going forward. And Brett Bontrager, Tony Byerly, the North American team, are really, really focused on it. But we are not going to get into profitability by customer or by channel on this call or ever, if it helps you going forward.
Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC: And then just maybe to clarify with the neutral impact to the balance of fiscal year on the mix of installation and RMR. Can you clarify what are the puts or takes then to drive sort of a flat operating margin performance for the balance of the year?
Donald Allan: Yes. I think our [indiscernible] -- and frankly, the impact wasn't that significant in Q1. It's not going to be that significant throughout the year. It's a relatively small impact of 20 to 30 basis points on the Security sector, and it's not something that we should be overly concerned about as a result of this year and going forward.
Operator: That was our last question. I will now turn it back to you for any final remarks.
Kate White Vanek: Thank you all for joining our call today. Again, if you have any questions or need any sort of follow-up, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
Operator: And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Tracy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stanley Black & Decker Fourth Quarter Full Year 2010 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to introduce and turn the call over to Ms. Kate Vanek, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Kate Vanek: Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, everybody, and thank you all for joining us for the Stanley Black & Decker Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, President and CEO; Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO.  I would like to point out that our fourth quarter earnings release, which was issued this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website, stanleyblackanddecker.com. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's fourth quarter and full-year 2010 results and various other topical matters followed by a Q&A session. The entire call should last approximately an hour. The replay will begin at 2:00 p.m. today. The number and access code are in our press release.  As a reminder, you can download the earnings replay as a podcast from iTunes and set up subscription for future replays going forward. And as always, please feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions after today's call.  The necessary comments here, we will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such, they involve risks and uncertainties. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. And we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with today's press release and in our most recent '34 Act. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.
John Lundgren: Thanks, Kate, and thanks for everybody who's joined us this morning on another beautiful but very snowy morning for those of you who are calling in from the Northeast. Just to highlight fourth quarter and full year, the first slide, all of which was in our press release, but I think important and worth repeating. Fourth quarter pro forma revenues, up 10% to $2.4 billion, 5% organic, with a modest adjustment in that number, which we think makes the most relevant comparison to adjust for the Black & Decker fiscal calendar moving in sync to the Stanley Works fiscal calendar. Fourth quarter diluted EPS of $1.05. On a GAAP basis, that's $0.81. The $1.05, of course, excluded the one-time charges primarily related to the merger, which was an impact of $0.24 or $39 million. Full year pro forma revenue increased 11%, and we are quite encouraged with organic growth of 7%. And full year diluted EPS, again excluding the merger-related charges, of $3.88, and on a GAAP basis, including all those charges, of $1.32.  So relative to our annual guidance and our implied fourth quarter guidance, volume was essentially flat. We achieved $10 million more in synergies in the fourth quarter, which accounted for about half of the overachievement, and the other half of the overachievement was split between tax and lower restructuring costs. A few notes out early this morning attributed all of the overachievement to tax and that simply is not correct. Don will give you some more granularity on that. So about half of the overachievement due to synergies and half due to a combination of restructuring charges and taxes.  We were really encouraged with cash flow, $935 million. Jim's going to give you some granularity on that later in the presentation. And I think of tremendous importance to everybody, the integration's proceeding well. I'm going to talk a little bit more about it a little later. SFS is taking hold. Legacy Black & Decker working capital turns were up 12% in 2010, and we're only just beginning to embed this across the entire company. Cumulative synergies, we have now projected at $425 million by the end of 2012, which is a significant increase from our original estimate of $350 million by March 2013. So in excess of 20% more cost synergies, three months sooner than we predicted and projected when we put these two companies together a year ago.  We've also given our first formal estimate on revenue synergies. We have identified $300 million to $400 million by 2013. More from Don a little later in the presentation on that. And next year, full year diluted EPS guidance between to $4.75 and $5, again excluding the one-time charges. And we're projecting cash flow to be $1.1 billion, or certainly in that neighborhood. So tremendous growth, both profit and volume growth opportunity going forward.  Let's look quickly at the geographies. Essentially, good solid growth in all but two markets, which accounted for only 8% of our combined revenue in total. First and foremost, at our largest market, the U.S., 3% growth in the fourth quarter, all on a pro forma basis, which we think is obviously the most helpful way for you to look at the progress as we put the two companies together, relative to year ago. U.S. does account for 54% of our revenue, and it grew at 3% in the fourth quarter. Moving over to Europe, accounting for 26% of our revenue, it grew at 4%. A lot of mixed performances within Europe. You're going to hear more about that from Jim. Really strong performance in Latin America, up 26%. It now accounts for 7% of our total. Continued strength in Asia, up 15%, and it's now 5% of our total. With only two markets, Australia and Canada, showing modest 1% or 2% organic revenue decline, respectively. Canada accounts for 6% and Australia about 2% of our combined revenue.  So growth driven primarily across all regions of the world. Emerging markets represent now about 11% of our total. But that is still significantly underweighted versus many diversified industrials where we would estimate approximately 20%, and in some cases as high as 25% or 30% of revenues, would come from emerging markets. And as a consequence, it should come as no surprise that a lot of the growth initiatives we're going to talk about going forward will be focused on these emerging markets and our ability to capitalize on our very strong position in Latin America and our increasingly strong position throughout Asia.  Looking at fourth quarter results, earnings increased 15%, excluding the one-time costs, consistent with our financial objectives. And the primary driver was $60 million of cost synergies realized during the quarter. That gave us $135 million of synergies for the year versus the $90 million that we originally projected. And as I've already said, fourth quarter was 10% higher than we had projected. And we simply couldn't be more grateful and more pleased with the synergy team leaders, the business heads and the functional heads who are working so hard to drive these synergies and who, up to this point in time, are executing so well against what we think are very aggressive objectives.  Looking at operating margin, you see fourth quarter '09 of 13.4%. 10.1% on a pro-forma basis versus 11.2% this year. So down 220 basis points on a GAAP basis and up 110 basis points on a pro forma basis, which we think is more relevant. Jim's going to give you quite a bit of granularity on that, so I won't spend much time other than to say that CDIY margins were relatively flat, a modest decline. Security was down, offset by really strong performance in our Industrial segment, right across the board. Industrial & Automotive Repair, Engineered Fastening and our new Infrastructure segment, both CRC and Hydraulics, which has been part of the portfolio for quite a while, posting very strong performance. Tax rate of 13.4%. And I've said the tax rate contributed to slightly less than half of our overachievement versus where we'd guided. And you see the share count, the effects of the share count, roughly 2x where they were a year ago due to the merger.  Moving on to the sources of growth in the fourth quarter. 5% organic revenue growth on a pro-forma basis, driven by market share gains in our Industrial portfolio, a very successful introduction of 12-volt Lithium Ion product and, as I've already suggested and indicated, really strong performance in the emerging markets. Looking at the two charts left to right, left is as reported, and I think it just makes sense to walk you through that, and the right is a better view of what's going on in each of the legacy businesses on a combined basis, both segment by segment.  So looking at the left real quickly, volume was up 5% in the fourth quarter. Price was flat, giving us organic growth of plus 5%. Currency was a 1% headwind, and acquisitions accounted for 145%. The overwhelming majority of that, 133%, obviously, was the inclusion of Black & Decker. More importantly, on a segment basis, Don's team has been able to break out both legacy Stanley, legacy Black & Decker on a pro forma basis, which we think tells you a lot more of what you really need and want to know.  Hand Tools, Fastening, Worldwide Power Tools, both legacy companies showed 4% organic growth in the quarter. As previously suggested, really strong performance in both Industrial segments. You have Proto, Mac, FACOM and as well as the infrastructure businesses included in that segment. And then Security and HHI, legacy Stanley was off marginally. Legacy Black & Decker with continued strong performance on Kwikset. Several other businesses up marginally. But for a total, quite symmetrical, both legacy companies showing 5% organic growth in the fourth quarter, which was consistent with where we thought we would be, and we're pleased with that achievement.  No quarterly earnings report or call would be complete without an update on the integration, and we'll obviously field any questions that we're able to. Importantly, we've done anything but let up on the rigorous integration process discipline that's been in place for the last year. Specifically, the Steering Committee rhythms continue, integration remains our top priority, the Integration Steering Committee continues to meet every two weeks. Six of our most senior executives, including Jim Loree, Don Allan, Nolan Archibald and myself, participate regularly in that session to be sure we understand what's going on.  And we look at numbers globally and then, at each session, we do a deep dive on either a business or a function to reassure ourselves that all programs are on track, that the synergy's in place or, if they aren't, we can dedicate more or reallocate resources to ensure they get back on track.  Don's team has done a great job in enhancing the database. The business leaders now have the information they need much quicker so they can use it to make decisions. And it's been a heck of a lot of work getting there. We're there. And that, of course, is facilitating the process nicely. Last but not least, we had the official rollout on January 11 of the Stanley Fulfillment System across the entire company. Pervasive internal communications and educational platforms are in place. You'll recall that we did this at legacy Stanley in 2007, and we have an even more comprehensive program based on three years of learnings that we're now driving across the entire company. So we think there's a tremendous opportunity yet on the expanded base to leverage the impact and all the benefits of SFS.  Cost synergies are going to exceed original target. We are hardly declaring success or early victory in that we've got a lot of heavy lifting yet to come. Phase 1 projects that are complete include the combining of the sales organizations in both CDIY and our Mechanical Security platform, combining North American parcel agreements, the corporate officer combination and all the corporate synergies, as well as risk management and audit fees. The difficulty and the intensity of the synergy projects will increase as we go forward.  Some of the first half projects will include benefit harmonization. The work is done. The HR team has worked tirelessly to make this happen. But now it will actually be implemented. And we have some plant and DC closures before us in the first half. We will not provide any granularity on the specifics because the policy that serves us well, and I know you will understand, until our specific employees, or in certain cases work councils and others, has been informed, it's nothing we're in a position to talk about externally. However, we've been clear all along that some of that exists, and we're getting on with it in 2011. We've done it before. We're quite optimistic that the programs are in place to do it correctly and effectively, and we'll keep you updated as those programs progress.  Last but not least, there's been a lot of interest in revenue synergies, and in our announcement this morning, we have formalized the $300 million to $400 million run rate by 2013. Key top line growth opportunities have been identified around the globe. Don's going to talk a little bit more about that, but primarily, they're coming in four buckets. CDIY's going to be a half to 2/3 of those synergies, understandably so. And the remainder of those synergies will be split evenly between the Industrial and Security platform. I think an interesting point is they're going to be funded primarily by CapEx, which implies, as you've probably already figured out in looking at the 2011 guidance, that a very high percentage of the cost synergies will fall to the bottom line, and we are very, very encouraged that we're in a position to do that or project that.  And needless to say, the investments that we're going to make in 2011, both in capital and brand support and product development, are going to drive these projects to fruition in 2012, 2013. Don will talk about it. A very small amount of these revenue synergies are included in our guidance for 2011.  Let me turn it over to Jim, who's going to give you, first, some more important detail on the segments. And I think of equal or perhaps even greater importance is he will talk about the impact of the Stanley Fulfillment System, what it's having on working capital and the impact it's having on our cash flow.
James Loree: Thanks, John. CDIY had a solid quarter in the face of continued sluggish market conditions, but stable market conditions in North America and Europe. The story here was successful integration, as John mentioned, and maintaining focus on the core business. Total revenues were up 274% to $1.273 billion. As John mentioned, organic growth was 4% in Hand Tools and Fastening and 4% in the legacy Black & Decker businesses. The Hand Tools growth was driven by a successful Bostitch Hand Tools launch last year as well as strength in Latin America. And the Power Tools story has a lot to do with the very successful 12-volt compact Lithium Ion launch that occurred late in the third quarter of last year across the three brands, DEWALT, Black & Decker and Porter-Cable, as well as strength in Latin America, which John did highlight. And all of this more than offset market weakness in the developed countries.  Moving to the segment profit rate, it was down 60 basis points year-over-year, with fourth quarter '09 shown at 11.9%. That's legacy Stanley only. And that will be the format for all three segments that I talk about. But I will mention the pro forma profitability in 4Q '09 was 11.8%. So very similar there. The story in terms of the rate contraction was that there was some negative price, about a point of negative price, and there was some inflation. So the price inflation arbitrage was a bit of an issue for these folks in the quarter, and then there was a slight effect from the mix of Power Tools as well.  I'd like to highlight for a minute the growth in Latin America. Legacy Black & Decker in Latin America, where they have that infrastructure already in place and had it, was up 28%. Legacy Stanley was up 36%. So a tremendous growth story down there. And just stepping back for a minute and looking at the total company in Latin America, organic growth across each of the six subregions, meaning Brazil, Argentina, a combination of Chile and Peru, Colombia, Mexico and Central America, none of those six subregions had organic growth of less than 20%. So you can see a tremendous story there.  And then going back to CDIY, I think we're very well positioned for a strong 2011, with a combination of slightly better markets, an array of new products, some carrying over and some yet to come in the coming months, revenue synergies and benefits from SFS. So these folks are hitting on all cylinders and moving in the right direction. Big part of the company.  Security. They had a respectable in-line quarter. Revenues were up 10%, driven entirely by the SSDS acquisition, and operating margin was up 17%. Revenues were $565 million. Organic revenues were down a point, consistent with Don's guidance on the last conference call. And segment profit was down 330 basis points to 16.6%. However, when you add back the effect of SSDS, the French ADT acquisition and GMT, a Chinese hardware acquisition, which we announced concurrent with the press release, it was really 17.7%. So you compare 19.9% to 17.7% and essentially what you have there are volume issues and mechanical, as well as some inflation and a really tough 21% prior-year comp in electronic, as well as mixing into larger customers in CSS. However, when you look at it on a pro-forma basis, that 19.9% becomes 17.7%. And so, when you compare the 17.7% pro forma to the 17.7% adjusted, excluding SSDS and GMT, you have essentially on a pro-forma basis a flat margin rate performance. And some of the issues that I talked about in MAS and CSS were completely offset by an excellent performance in HHI and that's what drives that.  So despite their weak markets and a few other issues, Security grew their operating margin 17%. We think they're well positioned for growth to resume in the first half, which will start with CSS, and I then I think by the second half of next year, we hope to see some resumption of growth in mechanical as well.  Moving on to Industrial. Once again Industrial was the star of the quarter. Their overall revenues were up 144% to $575 million. Organic growth was up 18%. Segment profit was up 219% to $85 million. If you look at the organic growth, the legacy Stanley Industrial part, which is primarily Industrial and Automotive Repair, also Hydraulics, was up a whopping 18%, and the legacy BDK business, which is Emhart, was up 10%. We think there was a fair amount of market share growth. When you look at the total segment on a pro-forma basis, there was 12 points of organic growth. We think about half of that was share gain, which occurred in Industrial & Automotive Repair, North America and Europe, as well as in Emhart. And then about a third of the growth of that 12 points was market related and about two points of restocking. So the restocking that we experienced in previous quarters has essentially come to completion at this point.  Segment profit was up nicely, from 11.3% to 14.8%. Without Emhart and CRC-Evans, it would have been 12.7%. So still 140 basis points of nice growth deriving from the legacy business. And that's obviously a lot of operating leverage involved there. And as I mentioned before, we included CRC and that added 150 basis points to the margin rate. And incredibly, CRC, in its first full quarter with Stanley Black & Decker, grew its organic volume over 50%. And the Hydraulics revenue as well in the Infrastructure segment was up over 50%, and that was driven by a rebounding scrap steel market. So Industrial continues to perform exceptionally well, and it continues to gain momentum.  Now, we'll talk for a moment about working capital. The journey to extract cash out of the working capital in the combined company has definitely begun. And as John mentioned, we have already begun to make some progress. In total, $133 million of cash in 2010 was generated by working capital improvement. And if you'll recall, the combined companies' working capital turns were 4.6 in the third quarter, moving to 5.7. And on a pro-forma basis, they were 5.2 and they improved to 5.7. So about a 10% improvement in the turns. But the big news here is what's ahead. Just two weeks ago, we rolled out the Stanley Fulfillment System to the 200 top executives in the company. The training, the communication, all the programmatic elements, just as we did back in January '07 when legacy Stanley was sitting in the mid-4s and ultimately brought that up to almost 8 turns over the succeeding two or three years. So this is just rerunning the tape, slightly better, more improved execution, we think, because we have the experience under our belt. And it's a huge opportunity, which we have a high level of confidence that we can execute. Now, I'll turn it over to Don Allan to take you through cash flow and some other items.
Donald Allan: Thank you, Jim. On Page 13, I'd like to walk through our free cash flow performance, which does exclude special charges. As John mentioned earlier, $935 million of free cash flow for the year, $451 million in the fourth quarter. And you can see that the impact of working capital that Jim was just describing, in the fourth quarter, positive inflow of $318 million, and for the year, $135 million. So clearly, we're beginning to see the benefits of this merger on cash flow. It's really beginning to demonstrate the power of the merger and our ability to generate significant cash flow in 2011 and beyond.  Moving to the next page, I'd like to talk briefly about long-term capital allocation strategy. Many of you are aware of our strategy that's been in place since 2004. And it has four primary objectives, the first of which is to target a strong investment grade credit rating. And we've done that over the years, and we'll continue to do that. Our current adjusted debt-to-cap ratio is slightly under 30%, right where we anticipated it to be at this stage of the merger. The investment of our free cash flow, we'd like to take 2/3 of that and put it into acquisitions over the long-term, and 1/3 of it goes back to shareholders, either through dividends or occasional share repurchases when the opportunity arises. And of course, we are committed to continued dividend growth over this timeframe as well.  But I will remind everybody that these allocations of 1/3 and 2/3 are not rigid annual formulas. There are things that we look for as a long-term objective. And actually since 2004, Stanley has returned almost 48% of its free cash flow to shareholders, either through dividends and occasional share repurchases. So we're actually slightly ahead of the pace there on that particular ratio. But we also recognize as a company that our company is changing dramatically, and the cash flow performance, excluding special charges of $935 million in 2010, which was $550 million approximately with special charges, and with very little special charges appearing next year as you'll see, the free cash flow potential here is quite significant, and it will be going beyond 2011, as well. So we are beginning the process in our February Board meeting of assessing the timing and the magnitude of a dividend increase. As many of you know, historically, we do that in July. And this meeting will be an opportunity for us to discuss a potential increase and the timing of that. So more information to come on that in the future.  Moving to cost and revenue synergies. As John mentioned, we've indicated that we are raising our cost synergies to $425 million in a slightly quicker timeframe than originally anticipated. Those of you who remember, back in November of 2009, we indicated $350 million of cost synergies. Year one was $125 million, same in year two, and then three was $100 million. As you see here on the page, we just recorded $135 million in 2010. We expect to have $165 million in 2011. And that's included in our guidance, which I'll review in a few minutes. And then in 2012, approximately $125 million to achieve that $425 million. Looking below that in a little more detail, if you remember, also back in November of 2009, we broke it into four different categories: manufacturing and distribution, corporate overhead, purchasing or sourcing and then business unit and regional consolidation. The original estimates for manufacturing and distribution were $45 million. We now believe it's $85 million. And that's primarily to do with, as we've gotten deeper into the integration, looking at the CDIY businesses of both legacy companies, as well as the HHI and Hardware and Mechanical Access businesses of Stanley, we have found more opportunities throughout the supply chain and manufacturing footprint to consolidate various activities, which we're quite excited about. But clearly those are difficult projects that take longer to do and really will be one of the main focuses, as John mentioned, for 2011 to ensure we're successful with those integration projects.  Corporate overhead was $95 million originally and still is $95 million. So we expect our estimate to hold there. And then purchasing, originally $75 million, is now up to $100 million as we've found a lot of excellent synergies in the indirect spend area. John mentioned freight. In 2010, we made a lot of progress there. But also in the direct spend area, we continue to find additional synergies, which allow us to feel comfortable with that $100 million estimate. And then the business unit and regional consolidation up slightly from $135 million original estimate to now $145 million. As we put the teams together around the world, slight improvement in that estimate. So in total, as I mentioned, $425 million, when you back out the $95 million of corporate, which leaves you about $330 million. Just a rough estimate, segment split, about 70% of that will go to CDIY, 20% to Security and then the remainder to Industrial.  Moving to the right side of the page, revenue synergies is something that, as you know, we've been very excited about. And this is our first communication around some numbers in this particular area. As John mentioned, we think revenue synergies will range between $300 million to $400 million by 2013. This implies an incremental EPS impact of about $0.35 to $0.50, which is an implied 25% operating margin. So we feel very good about where we are in the process of beginning to execute on revenue synergies.  A little more flavor on the estimates by type. As you remember back in November of 2009, we talked about different potential revenue synergies, and they're starting to come to life. The first is geographic expansion. Latin America is the opportunity that we've all talked about for over a year, and it clearly is coming to life in the estimate that we feel we will achieve in revenue synergies. We think about 30% of the top estimate I just reviewed will come from that type of expansion in Latin America, other emerging markets around the world such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East and China as well. And it's really leveraging that infrastructure that exists in either one of the legacy companies and the different products that now exist across our whole company.  So next area is channel and cross-selling, which is really taking the existing products that we have and funneling them through different channels where they might not be as strong today. We've talked about the IAR business as an opportunity to take Power Tools into that channel, and that's something that we see as a great revenue opportunity and that would be in that category. Brand expansion, take the great suite of brands that we have, the powerful brands of DEWALT, Stanley, et cetera, Black & Decker of course, and utilizing them in different product types and categories and channels and expanding that across the globe is another 30%. And then jointly taking our new product development skills and expertise across our new combined company and really leveraging new product opportunities, is the remaining 10% to get to that range of $300 million to $400 million. The segment split is about 2/3 CDIY. As you would imagine, the vast majority of it is in CDIY, and the remainder is split between our Industrial and Security segments. A great opportunity for us going forward, and we're really looking forward to the execution of that over the next two to three years.  Looking to Page 16, to give you a little more flavor on our outlook for 2011. After this page, I'll walk through in a little more detail the high-level assumptions. But I also want to give you a sense of the three different segments, what we actually are seeing and what we expect to occur in 2011. First, starting with CDIY. We do expect mid-single digit pro-forma organic revenue growth in 2011. We've experienced about 7% pro-forma organic growth of 10%. But clearly, there are trends and momentum in that business that we actually believe will continue throughout 2011. One of the main reasons we feel really good about it is all the new different product launches, new product launches that have occurred. You've heard about the 12-volt subcompact Lithium Ion products have been rolled out in the last three to six months. Those will continue to roll around the globe, but we're also expecting to get significant share gains from other new products in our pipeline that will be rolling out in different parts of the world, as well as expanding our brands, as I mentioned, as a revenue synergy.  Looking geographically in CDIY, we expect revenue to grow in all regions of the world. But clearly, Latin America will outpace the rest of the world because we really see that as a significant opportunity. One reminder around operating margins for CDIY. We had significant operating margin rates in the first half of 2010 due to much lower promotional spend because of some uncertainty around the merger and the timing. We will return to a more normal spend rate in the first half of 2011, so it will be a bit of a headwind. But clearly for the full year, the CDIY operating margins accretion will be significant, as expected.  Moving to Security. As Jim mentioned, Security has struggled a little bit from a top line perspective, but considering the economic dynamics, the fact that they were only down 1% pro-forma organic revenue in 2010 is actually a pretty healthy performance. We do expect them to turn to a positive growth in 2011, but it will be low single pro-forma organic revenue, because the markets that they serve, in particular commercial construction, where the Mechanical Access business has a significant presence, will likely continue to be sluggish at least through the first half of 2011, if not for the entire year of 2011. They are looking at various different new product opportunities and clearly revenue synergies of cross-selling with the HHI business that can leverage and offset some of those market dynamics and really minimize that impact. Our Convergence business, we expect to have organic growth in 2011 at a more significant pace than Mechanical Access because we do expect Installation revenue growth to return, and we also expect the National Account market to get stronger as the year progresses.  The Healthcare Solutions performance was strong in the fourth quarter, up 7%, and we would anticipate that, that growth rate would continue in 2011. HHI, our Residential Hardware business, in particular, will probably have a bit of a struggle from a top line perspective. It will be up modestly. But there are various new product launches and expanded distribution channels and some revenue synergies that will offset any sluggishness in that particular area.  Moving to Industrial. A great year in 2010 for Industrial. Pro-forma organic revenue up 23%. We do expect the revenue growth to turn to something that maybe is more historically typical for this industry, more in the mid-single-digit growth rates. But even with that, we have a lot of exciting things going on there. Jim talked about the EXPERT tool launch in our Industrial & Automotive Repair Tool business back in October in our Q3 earnings release. That's going to begin to expand across the globe in different markets and into emerging markets as well. That will drive some growth. We don't expect restocking to occur in 2011. It has pretty much ended, and the levels of inventory that we do see in our customers and end-users appears to be healthy and appropriate.  Engineered Fastening, Emhart, has been very strong in 2010. Global automotive production around the world is expected to rise by 5%. So therefore, we expect our business to grow as well as gain some market share along the way. And then, of course, last but not least, CRC-Evans has started off very well here as part of Stanley Black & Decker, and we expect there's going to be growth in both offshore and international markets that will drive a nice top line performance for them as well.  So let's move to the overall guidance for Stanley Black & Decker for 2011. First of all, the vast majority of what I will show you here excludes the various merger and acquisition-related one-time charges. So our EPS guidance for the year is $4.75 up to $5 EPS. It's based on sales growth assumption. First of all, net organic sales going up 5% to 6% off a pro-forma level of $9.3 billion. So if our companies had been combined for the entire year 2010, the revenues would have been $9.3 billion. Revenue synergies will add about an incremental 50 basis points to 2011 revenues, with a relatively modest EPS impact because we will be making investments to really build certain infrastructure and certain organizations to maximize the value of these particular revenue synergies in 2012 and 2013. The acquisition revenue impact of CRC-Evans, SSDS, GMT and InfoLogix will approximate about 3% growth off that pro forma number. So in total, that's about 9% growth if you use the midpoint of 5% to 6% for organic. $165 million in cost synergies, as I mentioned previously, due to the merger. And then operating margin rate, we expect to expand by 150 basis points versus the 2010 rate of 12.6%.  Embedded in there, though, is that there clearly is a significant negative impact related to the inflation price arbitrage. We are seeing significant increases in various commodities, in particular steel, resin and copper, of anywhere from 10% to 20% currently, with the anticipation that it likely will go up further from there. As a result, we actually believe there will be a drag of about 100 basis points offsetting a portion of those synergies. But still a very healthy operating rate improvement year-over-year from 2010, up by 150 basis points.  The tax rate will approximate 25% to 26%. If you adjust for all the unusuals in 2010, our tax rate was 24.6%. So relatively in line with what happened in 2010. We will likely have some non-merger and acquisition-related restructuring activities, which will approximate the 2010 level of $25 million, so flat year-over-year. And then the charges associated with the acquisitions that I mentioned up above, as well as the Black & Decker transaction, will be up approximately $105 million, $90 million of which is restructuring and related and then $15 million is SG&A and other types of costs. So significantly lower than the $530 million or $540 million that we saw in 2010, but still quite significant.  As a result, free cash flow will approximate $1.1 billion, which excludes those special charges that I just mentioned. And a couple assumptions associated with that. Our capital expenditures will increase in 2011 due to investments that we need to make related to revenue synergies that John touched on earlier in the call. So our typical ratio has been -- we like to spend anywhere from 2% to 2.5% of revenue. In 2010, we will likely spend between 2.5% and 2.8% of revenue, but that will be a one-year phenomenon, and we'll return to more historical levels back in 2012. Additionally, we do expect a modest improvement in working capital, approximately a half turn improvement year-over-year as we continue to see some of the early benefits and early wins of the Stanley Fulfillment System.  So to conclude the presentation portion of our call this morning, the potential for strong organic growth and profit growth in 2011 and beyond is clear. But it's also clear that this achievement is very contingent on us continuing to be successful with the integration of the Black and Decker merger, and that is a very high priority for us. The increased cost synergy targets, we're very excited about that and really is driving enhanced profitability in the company as you saw in the guidance. The revenue synergy target has been identified, and we will be providing more details around these opportunities at our Analyst Day in New York City in March. Jim mentioned and John mentioned that in our annual management meeting on January 11, we really relaunched, kicked off the effort of the Stanley Fulfillment System and the opportunity and the path for improvement across our whole company. And you can definitely see and feel people embracing it company-wide. And then last, but certainly not least, on this page, $1.1 billion of free cash flow for 2011. I will say our acquisition pipeline is very robust, but we also recognize how significant this integration is, and it needs to be our top priority as we progress throughout 2011. So with that, we'll move to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim from Crédit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG: I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more in terms of the expectations for the margin erosion based on price and inflation. Is that based on the historical relationships capturing 80% of commodity costs and such? Is there something else driving that? And has the view changed at all based on the acceptance of the Black & Decker products that are coming out now or that success?
James Loree: And clearly, our current estimate, we definitely have some price recovery against that inflation, but it's at lower levels than what we've historically seen at legacy Stanley. As you know, legacy Stanley has had a track record of recovering about 80% to 85% of inflation over various inflationary time periods. In this particular case, we think we're looking at about 1/3 to 50% recovery of inflation at this stage. We have different dynamics now in our new combined company. Clearly, there's a whole set of individuals that need to learn the different rhythms, the center of excellence that we have around pricing and the processes and how we go about doing that. Second, the competitive dynamics are much different on the Black & Decker side of our company than the Stanley Hand Tools side. There's three or four significant competitors that we need to factor in as we make pricing decisions around inflation. So we need to be aware of that as part of the decision-making process. And also, when you look at the business as well, it is clearly a significant part of our company, Black & Decker, and has various commodity components to it, just like Stanley Hand Tools does. So it's going to have more of an impact from things such as if the RMB gets reval-ed as well. That's a risk in that number. And so there's various different things that we need to consider as part of this. But over the long term, we anticipate that we will drive a lot of these rigors and rhythms into the company across the entire globe and across the entire businesses. But there's a transition that needs to take place. And you also have to combine it with the last factor that I didn't even touch on, is that we are catching up a little bit on the technology side with some of our products, in Black & Decker and DEWALT in particular. And when you have that bit of a disadvantage on a few of your products to your competition, it makes pricing even more difficult. So all those factors need to be considered, and why we will have some pressure in 2011 related to that inflation price arbitrage.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG: The second question, I was just wondering, you talked about looking at the dividend. Wondering just what your thoughts in terms of share repurchase would be at the times that you look at the free cash flow coming in for the year?
James Loree: When we will do what?
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG: You talked about the dividends in terms of looking at that. But given the free cash flow coming in, what's the thought on share repurchase?
Donald Allan: Share repurchase for us is always opportunistic. We look at the stock price, we look at our free cash flow performance. We also have to consider the pipeline of acquisitions and kind of counter the balance between the two of making that decision. Right now, our priority is to focus on the timing and the magnitude of our dividend increase. And as the year progresses and those different factors evolve, we obviously will continue to evaluate share repurchases.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh, Raymond James.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates: First off, in the incremental synergy savings, it looks like a big chunk of it's coming from manufacturing and distribution. I guess about $45 million incrementally versus your prior views, which is a big deal. I mean that's 5% of annual earnings or so. And it's notable given that you really don't have a whole lot of product overlap with the two primary businesses. So could you give a little bit of color as to why such a large incremental savings is now expected in that particular subset?
John Lundgren: As I alluded to, Sam, and Jim may want to provide a little more color, it's more in distribution than manufacturing for exactly the reason you've cited. These are hand tools and power tools are different processes. That being said, as we've understood the legacy Black & Decker footprint a little better, and we've touched on, there is an opportunity to produce Stanley Hand Tools in legacy Black & Decker facilities in certain geographical markets. Not much of that goes the other way. But what's of tremendous value is the opportunity to combine more distribution centers, we think in a low risk way, run them in parallel until we need to. I mean specifically, we're serving the same end-users and the same customers in the same channels in the same geographies. And as we learn about third-party warehouses and things that are outsourced that we have the opportunity to insource, there's a tremendous amount on the distribution front. So it's skewed in that direction. As it relates to specific facility closures that we weren't sure we could -- we thought we could look at but did not include in our original estimates, I will just apologize and revert to what I said earlier. Depending on the geography, until we've talked to employees and/or works councils about those plans, we can't talk about them externally. But I think you know our track record well. We have a high degree of confidence that there are a couple plants that we've added to the list of potential consolidation that weren't there this time last year. So overwhelmingly on the distribution side, a little bit avoiding constructing hand tool plants, and then the opportunity to consolidate a couple facilities in different geographies.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates: And the only follow up I have, Don, I noticed you didn't mention the RMB at all, but that FX is likely to be flat or expected to be flat. Is any anticipations of a revalue there going to be inherent within your inflation expectations or how should we look at that relationship?
Donald Allan: Yes, we have estimated within our inflation estimate a potential RMB adjustment of anywhere between 3% and 5%.
John Lundgren: And Sam, I'll just add, as I'm sure you and others understand, while that places some pressure to the extent that the RMB becomes stronger, many of our customers are going to see materials and pricing pressure from private label suppliers where 100% of the product is coming direct from China. It doesn't change our view. And Don's, I thought, very, very accurate and helpful explanation on the 100 basis points of arbitrage that we think will be behind at least for a year. That being said, the more our large customers are seeing meaningful inflation that's RMB driven, obviously, it makes it easier for us to have a price conversation. And that's going to help mitigate a lot of the pure impact of raw materials inflation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan.
William Wong: This is actually Will Wong on for Mike. Just a quick question on the CDIY margins. You guys mentioned that, in 2010, you had a lack of normal promotion spend. Can you sort of talk about what you're seeing for the first half of '11 in terms of what you think a normal promotion spend would be?
Donald Allan: What I was referring to is that in our guidance, I wanted people to recognize that in the first half of 2010, there was very little promotional spend in the Black & Decker part of our company. Because there was a lot of uncertainty around the timing of the closing and the merger, there were decisions being made about individuals, et cetera. So the promotional spend was not at the level that you would typically see. In 2011, we expect that to return to normal levels. As far as an actual estimate, it's not something that I have in my fingertips, but it's not minor by any stretch of the imagination. I'm sure Kate Vanek could follow up with a little more detail on that afterwards.
William Wong: You guys broke out some of the revenue synergies by 2013, and you have channel cross-selling and brand expansion as basing up 60% of that revenue synergy. Can you just go into a little bit more detail, if you guys have that, in terms of like brand expansion? Where do you see that happening, as well as the cross-selling? Is there any cannibalization that you see?
James Loree: I'll talk about it generally, but specifically, if you've followed us, and I know Mike has and you have, too, until we presented it to a customer and you can find it at a customer level, we are not going to talk about it externally on an earnings call. But brand expansion is an example of things that are in the -- things that are in the marketplace that have already taken place is a DEWALT hand tool introduction in certain channels. That would have never happened before these two companies came together. That's one that's in the marketplace that people have seen, and that's just a really good example of something. Cross-selling, again I can talk about what's happened historically. Cross-selling is something as simple as legacy Black & Decker is extremely well established in the step bit channel with its powerful, powerful DEWALT business. Legacy Stanley Hand Tools, despite being number one or two in almost every category, is underdeveloped in the step bit channel. So as the historically the DEWALT salesperson is selling DEWALT power tools in the step bit channel, there's the opportunity to sell more Stanley Hand Tools at the same time. So those are one example that we've already put forward of brand expansion and cross-selling that essentially is in the marketplace. Anything new, with apologies, we have a policy that says we're not going to talk about those externally until we've talked about them to our customers. And that's served us well in the past, and we're going to stick with that.
William Wong: In terms of interest expense and other net expense, as well as corporate expense, do you guys have any more color on that in terms of how we should be thinking about that?
Kate Vanek: I'll follow up...
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill from Zelman Associates.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: I was just hoping to push you guys a little bit more on the free cash/usage of that. You'll probably be somewhere in the $2.5 billion range on the books at the end of this year. And even if you doubled the dividend, you'd still be over $2 billion. And it sounds like you're rightfully very focused on the BDK acquisition, so nothing large on the acquisition front. And there's more free cash flow behind that as we move forward. So I'm just trying to better understand the share repurchase comment, because it sounded like that was more of a small impact this year, if any, and trying to figure out how you guys think about the good problem of too much cash.
James Loree: A good problem is a great problem for anyone to have, and it's a high-class problem. But one of the things that we're a little -- I think it's a huge opportunity for us, is to get our yield back up to a point where we think that it's attractive to a certain type of investor that has historically been very interested in owning our stock. And right now, we're hovering around a 2% yield, and we're about 50 basis points or so below where we would normally be. And part of that has been the stock price appreciation, which has been driven by the earnings and the cash generation. So that makes perfect sense. And that's why re-evaluating the dividend is our number one cash deployment issue right now or opportunity. And then secondly, as Don mentioned, when it comes to repurchases, we generally look at them opportunistically. The first thing to understand is, of the cash on the balance sheet, virtually 100% of that is overseas and cannot be accessed for things like repurchases and dividends unless we repatriate it, which we're not likely to do anytime soon because of the current tax policy. Now if the tax policy were to change, your hypothesis would be a lot more -- in terms of the magnitude, would be a lot more appropriate or relevant in this particular case. So we don't have this mountain of cash that we can just simply return to the shareholders. What we will do with the international cash is continue to look -- it's very fortunate that where we'd like to grow is internationally in Security and in some of the other platforms. So we are actively looking for international acquisitions, like many multinational companies. And then when we consider share repurchase versus deploying domestic cash for acquisitions, we first look at it strategically. And we have long-term financial objectives, which are to grow the revenue at 10% at 12% annually and organic growth 4% to 5% annually. So to make up the difference between the 4% to 5% and the 10% to 12%, there's a fair amount of acquiring that has to go on. We don't expect 2011 to be a banner year for acquisitions because of the focus on integration. But we do expect to make some acquisitions. So that will consume some of the cash. And then whatever is left over, we look at, is it the appropriate time to buy back stock? What is the EPS accretion from doing that versus investing in more acquisitions? That type of analysis. And what are the future cash flow prospects, et cetera, for the company? So there's no formula for doing it. It's an ongoing process that we go through. And as I said, right now, our first focus is going to be on evaluating the level of dividend and making sure that we address that issue as we go forward.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Just a separate thought, I think, Jim, you said on a pro forma basis, with all the businesses in the last year and the CDIY business, you probably would've seen somewhere in the 50-basis-point margin contraction. And I was just hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the moving parts there because you obviously have a lot of synergy costs in there. You had good volume leverage. You mentioned promotional spend was down versus what would typically be the case. I know that you have some raw materials, but is that the bulk of that? Or is anything else there that we should be considering?
James Loree: Are you talking about the fourth quarter performance or a prospective...
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: Just the fourth quarter.
James Loree: It was quite simple. I mean the -- inflation spiked up in the quarter. Price was negative. So we had an unfavorable arbitrage. That was, by and large, the primary driver. Then there was some -- obviously the synergies were a big offset to that. There was also, on a year-over-year basis, there was more promotional spending than there was in the fourth quarter of '09. But those are basically the moving parts.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates: So the promotional spend was lower than normal but still up from '09?
John Lundgren: No, promotion spend in '10 was quite normal. Don's point was...
James Loree: First half of 2010 was where it...
John Lundgren: Don's point was in '09 and early '10, as we were putting two organizations together and sorting through the various SBUs and which particular brands and businesses would receive the majority of our brand support, we had about a nine-month period where it was below normal. But that would not have applied to the fourth quarter of 2010.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: First, the guidance when you made the deal was to make I think $5 in 2012, and you're now effectively saying you're going to make $5 in 2011. I'm just interested in perspective on what's changed to get you to that earnings number a year earlier?
John Lundgren: Yes. What we said is by year three, we would have $5 of EPS. Now we're saying $4.75 to $5 in 2011. But clearly the top line performance has been quite significant in 2010. We're projecting 5% to 6% organic growth in 2011 and that revenue synergies on top of that of a half a point. And originally, the projections were for top line to be about 2%. We were in a different market at the time, different set of circumstances. The economy was very slowly recovering. And now we're seeing a more robust top line performance than we originally anticipated. So that's the first factor. The second factor is we obviously looked at $350 million of cost synergies happening in three years. Now we're saying $425 million is going to happen in 2 3/4 quarter years or by the end of 2012. And frankly, it looks like by the end of 2011, we will be very close to $350 million, achieving that on a run rate basis. So it's the acceleration of the cost synergies, higher cost synergies and it's a more robust revenue performance and outlook. Those are the two major factors.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Secondly, within the CDIY business, and I understand that a little bit better, why the 4Q margin looked like it did, and you've framed out how the first half CDIY margin may not look as good as the full year because of this promotional compare. But can you take a step up a level perhaps and talk about the earnings and margin opportunity in that business as you regain market share with Lithium Ion? Can you just speak to the margin opportunity in that business? Does the product mix change anything? I'm just interested if the earnings opportunity in that business is different than what you'd thought before trying to sift through these moving parts?
James Loree: I mean the opportunity is all good, and it's all positive because you have -- as I mentioned earlier, there's a confluence of things that are coming together here in this business. We have slightly better markets. We have an array of new products. We have carryover in that respect. We have new products that we're going to introduce in the coming months. We have the revenue synergies, the SFS implementation. There's just a lot of good things happening. And yes, we have a little bit of inflation headwind, but we also have improving price management capability on new products that are going to improve our value proposition. So we really have a lot of good things going. So can we put a number on it? Absolutely not, because if everything good happened, nobody would believe the number. So I think we have to just kind of go with what we are we saying for 2011 and assume that we'll deliver that. And then there's probably more opportunity beyond that in '12 and '13.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas, Janney Montgomery Scott.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: First question, I thought it was interesting, the wording of relaunching of SFS company-wide and the being embraced company-wide. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of color. One, from a training perspective, will there be any costs associated with that? And secondly, with SFS being relaunched, are your incentive comp plans changing at all?
John Lundgren: I'll take it, Jim. There's a heck of a lot of training. And I'll say, what I alluded to is we had a good launch with legacy Stanley in 2007. It took six to 12 months for it to really gain traction. And we think primarily via providing robust online materials, as well as making it a focal point of things like the national sales meeting for the CDIY team when they're all together anyway at the same place, at the same time, making that an important part of the team. Particularly stressing the importance for the legacy Black & Decker side of the business. Who I have to say, and I think would admit, a year ago we were somewhat skeptical what's SFS and what are its benefits? I think now there's complete buy-in because everyone's seen the power. So we've got better materials. A lot of it, again, is online. So the incremental training cost is not material, I guess, would be my response to that. And I think the second part of your question, if I understood it, is we've learned from where we were in the past. The opportunity is tremendous. Folks have embraced it. And the whole objective in emphasizing it is can we get an even faster start? Can we gain traction in three months as opposed to, say, six to nine or 12, which is what it took us before. And that's really the reference to it.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: My question on that was really internally.
John Lundgren: Let me, so we don't get cut off. You asked about comp plans. Our comp plans won't change, in that the legacy Stanley comp plans will prevail and a tremendous, a large percentage -- there's both short term and long term, as you know. And short term, a very meaningful percentage of everyone's comp will be based on cash flow or working capital turns, which simply means implementing SFS, and depending on whether you have any control over payables or the total cash flow. If you're not, it's reducing working capital and improving turns as a surrogate for that. That's up to 50% of any individuals comp-ed in this company. That won't change. Long term, the two elements of earnings growth and ROCE, which are obviously reducing the denominator, is going to have a tremendous impact on how people get paid, that won't change either. So simply said, it's the legacy Stanley systems that prevail, and upwards of 50% of both short and long-term compensation are dramatically influenced by cash conversion, working capital reduction and return focused.
James Loree: And then, Jim, in addition to that, one of the things that made the Stanley legacy initiative is so successful in getting from 4.5 to almost 8 turns over the course of three years, was that the board put in place a special bonus plan for a couple hundred of the most senior people in the company. And that turned out to be a tremendous motivating factor and a glue that held the whole initiative together. And that was actually paid out. It was a three-year horizon. It was actually paid out last year, in the middle of the year. And given the opportunity on the table, the Board decided to kind of re-put that plan in place for the combined company. So you also have this very direct correlation between the achievement of between 7 and 8 working capital turns within a three-year period and a direct monetary incentive for a couple of hundred of the most senior people in the company.
John Lundgren: And, again, Jim, to come back, that existed before. We're doing it again. So the focal points and the drivers are, I think, quite consistent. It's just over a base that's 2x the size.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: On the acquisition side, CRC was an interesting acquisition to build out your infrastructure side of your platform. And clearly, a lot of management resources dedicated on the CDIY side. You alluded to Security in one of the earlier answers in terms of international acquisition focus. But could you give us an update in terms of the pipeline of where exactly you're seeing the activity building these days in terms of your various growth platforms?
John Lundgren: Yes and no. I'm going to have Jim respond, because obviously we can't mention specific targets but we can certainly mention platforms and geographies. Jim, I think that's fair.
James Loree: I also think it's pretty obvious that the busiest people in the company right now are the ones that are working on the revenue synergy implementation and the cost synergy implementation. And the most kind of stretched organization would be CDIY and the regions that are strong and prevalent in CDIY. So you're not likely to see anything of any meaningful size, if anything, in those particular areas where people are very stretched working on the integration. So I think the first rule would be, if we do something, it would in all likelihood be either in the Healthcare or Infrastructure growth platforms where there's nothing going on with respect to the integration, or in Electronic security, where there's basically no integration going on with respect to the Black & Decker merger. Perhaps in Mechanical, if it were to occur in a geography where there was not a lot of activity and integration going on. And then maybe in Industrial Tools would be the other area if something were to come up.
John Lundgren: And again, discriminating in favor of high growth or emerging markets, as I think is clear from our previous statements.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Deutsche Bank.
Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank: It's actually Nicole. I wanted to talk a little bit more about the Lithium Ion launch. If you guys could talk a little bit about the signs of success that you're seeing there and just comment on, you said in the past that you think that you can gain back the share that Black & Decker had lost over the past cycle, if you still think that rings true?
John Lundgren: The answer is yes. The only granularity, Nicole, that I think we're able to give you, it's only been in the marketplace essentially a quarter. And I think, best estimate, Black & Decker lost 1 1/2 to two share points a year for three years. So five to six share points in that category space. And we think in the course of our projections, which was three years, we can and will gain that back. It's way too early to say we have and we will. There's obviously going to be a competitive response to such a terrific product that obviously has a strong brand behind it, well positioned in terms of price, and we are absolutely confident in its performance. So there's no reason to change our statement that the five to six share points we lost in cordless power tools over about a three-year period, that we'll gain back in the same amount of time or less. That's all we're in a position to say at this stage.
Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank: And then I understand that promotional spending is going to be picking up on a year-on-year basis in CDIY in the first half, but could you talk about how that moves q-on-q typically between 4Q and 1Q? Does the first quarter and the first half tend to be heavier promotionally versus the fourth quarter or lighter?
James Loree: The first quarter tends to be a little lighter than the fourth quarter, and then the second quarter is very heavy. And so the second and third and fourth quarters are heavy promotional quarters. The first is probably the lightest of the four.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: I guess, first question, just to continue on the SFS or the free cash flow outlook. If I look at the reintroduction, as you call it, or SFS being reintroduced, my guess is you take that revenue synergies, and just better execution, then all of a sudden the target of $1 billion in free cash flow that you laid out a year or so ago is pretty conservative. How should we think about that in terms of, you look two or three years out, and what the free cash flow generation profile of the business might be?
James Loree: We're not there yet, Pete. I think Don has been quite granular on -- $1.1 billion is a very, very big number next year, which means roughly a 10% cash flow yield, which is a very, very large number. Obviously, we have the objective and the programs in place to continue to increase it. But on this call, we aren't going to project cash flow three years out. We're absorbing and digesting our past accomplishments and making sure the programs are in place to deliver $1.1 billion. Not to say if we can deliver more, we won't. But as you know, because you follow us so closely, our cash flow by the nature of the business is always backend loaded in the course of the year. So it's going to be well into the fourth quarter next year before we have complete confidence around the $1.1 billion. And as a result, would have the confidence to provide a larger number or better granularity on cash flow specifically in 2012 and '13.
John Lundgren: But if you were just doing big picture modeling, we're going to have some earnings growth. That's out there, so that would definitely be an impact and a significant one. And DNA is going to kind of be at or near those levels for a while, probably even grow a little bit with some acquisitions, if we do some acquisitions in the future. And you can figure out for yourself how much of the working capital turns you think might go into the cash flow statement. But that pretty much you can do your own modeling, and you probably wouldn't be far off from what we would provide at a later date, anyway.
James Loree: Yes, we've said publicly about working capital that we think there's a $400 million to $500 million opportunity to unlock in this merger. So that clearly gives you an indication of that magnitude over a three to four-year period.
John Lundgren: And the question is how fast we can unlock it, and how much of it truly is converted and flows to cash.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: And I know it's kind of small, but the GMT acquisition, to what extent is that a platform acquisition for you in China? If you look at the revenue base that you have there, it's pretty small, but it looks like this could be a business that's perhaps scalable. Can you just maybe comment on that business and sort of the China strategy to a small degree?
James Loree: Well, China is a terrific market for hardware in some ways and in some ways, it's a more challenging market. We like the GMT business because GMT, it's like Kleenex or Xerox for floor hinges and commercial hardware in China. So if you go to a commercial building in China and you open those big glass doors and you look down at the floor, I think about eight times out of 10, you'll see a GMT brand on the hinge. So they have a terrific distribution network in China. They have a great brand. And their limitation is that they're really specialists in floor hinges. So clearly we can bring some product expertise to GMT, and they can bring some low-cost manufacturing to us to help manufacture those products. So I think you're onto something. I do think this is a very nice platform for commercial hardware expansion. Whether we get into residential hardware in the future will be something that we continue to evaluate because, number one, there is no GMT of residential hardware. And secondly, it is a more challenging market because it is so fragmented. And I'm talking about residential now. And in residential, some of the private company owners run these companies with a different overhead structure than we can. And that's more because we insist on compliance with laws and regulations as opposed to we're top heavy. So that's an issue in residential and whether we can make money or not. That's still an open question. But clearly GMT provides the commercial hardware framework for expansion.
John Lundgren: I think the key takeaway from what Jim said, all of which is totally correct, there is a huge Chinese domestic market factor within GMT. Quite often, one makes one of those acquisitions essentially as an LCC outsourcing opportunity. Jim made it very clear, but I want to be sure that it's understood, that they have a very strong position in the Chinese commercial construction market. This is not something that we've acquired simply because they can produce product at low cost and export it to Western markets. We'd like to participate in the growth of the Chinese market, and this is a very important step in that direction.
James Loree: But it also -- John raises that point which sparked a thought on my part, too, which is another really attractive element of GMT is that they are exporters into Southeast Asia. So not only do you get the China coverage, but you get the entire coverage of the entire Southeast Asian region.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Michael Kim from Imperial Capital.
Michael Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Just turning back to Security. One of your larger competitors this morning reported fairly good recovery in their North American commercial business. Are you guys seeing maybe a little more cautious recovery in the market or are there certain verticals where you're seeing strength, but offset by other areas that you're focused in? And can you tie that a little bit with the guidance commentary, with Mechanical being a little bit flatter, more modest up this year? Are you looking at the Convergent side growing at a much stronger pace through the balance of the year?
James Loree: I have to admit, I haven't had time to review all our competitor's press releases this morning as it was a very busy morning. However, what one might surmise from that is the fact that we are less commercial construction driven than our two competitors. So we are more leveraged to healthcare, education and government and the like. And we're also more leveraged to the retrofit market, which has been particularly weak. So if there in fact is a relative comparison which makes us look unfavorable, it's quite possible that it's driven by the mix of business. And perhaps, they're observing a little more kind of better volume in the commercial construction market, and we might not be benefiting from that level of concentration in commercial construction. So it's been a long time since anybody said anything positive about commercial construction, and I'm looking forward to reading the release. As far as Convergent goes, we are pretty optimistic about their ability to grow beginning in the first half, and we think that's going to help the Security segment tremendously get off to a good start here in 2011.
Michael Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners: And just specifically on the Convergent side, can you provide any color on some of the key metrics in terms of either the count or the ARPU or attrition, even just directional trends of how each of those metrics have changed in the quarter?
Donald Allan: I wouldn't say that we've had significant change in any of those metrics over the last quarter or two. The real trend has been around installation orders in our Convergent Security business being modestly showing modest growth. But now we begin to get order trends in the last quarter that's been a little better than that, which is why we feel good about the statement that Jim just made that we expect to see growth in the first half in our Convergent business. And I also indicated, when I went through the segment outlook, that we did expect the Convergent business growth outpace the Mechanical Access security business, which was the point you were making earlier. So that's where we think a lot of the growth is going to come from in that particular segment, particularly in the first half of 2011, but also likely for the year.
Kate Vanek: That concludes our call today. Thank you all for tuning in. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Because of the complexity of this quarter and the large amount of content the entire call was expected to last approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes in order to provide adequate time for Q&A. A replay of the call will be available beginning at 2 pm today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. As a reminder you can also download the earnings replay of the podcast from itunes and even set up the subscription for future replays of the calls we post. This should be posted within 24 hours.  I also wanted to call your attention to Stanley’s 2009 annual toured and annual review website and videos that we launched yesterday. We decided to go online this year with a lot of our normal annual report content and we invite you to check up the site and explore the videos which feature conversations with senior management as well as the interactive charts and informational resources throughout the site.  It’s a great way to become more familiar with the outstanding storey. You can access this through our home page. And as always please feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions you might have after today’s call. We will be making some forward looking statements during this call such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and especially involves risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward looking statements that we might make today, and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the form 8-K which we filed with today’s press release and in our most recent 34 act.  With that I will now turn the call over to our CEO John Lundgren.
John Lundgren:  Thanks, Kate and good morning everybody. Let me just start by saying this had the potential to be a confusing and very noisy quarterly release, due to the obvious fact that the Black & Decker transaction closed three weeks before the end of the quarter.  So I did want tot thank those of the legacy Black & Decker and Stanley finance teams first of all for closing three sets of books at least in a very short period of time and for extraordinary efforts in that regard as well as the finance and IR teams for pulling together what we think is a clear presentation. But as Kate said she will be available as when management is necessary. Later on in the day and later on in the week to clarify anything that’s still outstanding at the end of this call. So lets get started, diluted EPS was $0.70 and that did include and $0.04 negative impact based on the acquisition, of ADT France which closed on March 9. It excludes one time charges. We did reference the ADT transaction in the press release, so we are not going to spend a lot of time on it this morning other than to say it is strategic and to fit extraordinarily well with its GDP, general protection our French Electronic Security business and as Don will discuss in his guidance, we still believe that this acquisition is going to be meaningfully accretive $0.07, $0.08 in your tree on the expanded share base. So diluted EPS including the charges of $213 million was a loss of $1.9 and again Don’s going to give you more of a granularity on the charges and their composition in the quarter which we believe to be quite clear. The gross margin rate excluding charges was 39.4% and excluding Black & Decker with the impact of Black & Decker for the three week stub period the rate improved 120 basis points versus the first quarter 09 to 40.8% and that is a first quarter record for our company. Free cash flow was positive $37 million excluding charges and payments related to the transaction.  Working capital was encouraging as well, reaching 7.3 turns excluding Black & Decker and 4.6 turns on a pro-forma basis including both companies in those results. CDIY segment, our largest segment profit improves to $83 million and that is up 189% excluding the charges. Industrial saw a nice rebound, profit rate improving 280 basis points to 13.2% again excluding the charges and as I had mentioned earlier ADT France closed on March 9. It’s going to be a great addition and complementary to our existing conversion securities solution platform in Europe. The integration which I am sure everyone is curious about into how its progressing, we think very well and we are going to talk a little bit more about the synergy target and our estimates and Don is going to give you some detail on our 2010 guidance for the combined company which is now at $3.10 to $3.33 per share excluding the one time charges. So moving to the first quarter results of the combined company very simple and straight forward a 46% increase excluding the charges as you can see to about $2.70 for one Q 2010 and the charge is related to $213 million or translated to $1.79 a share on the new share base reflecting the timing of the acquisition. So, on a GAAP basis, a loss of $1.9. The only thing that might look a little odd is the minus 1.4% tax rate.  Just very quickly it’s a one time event the charges had an impact of about 35.2% on the tax rate not all of those charges were tax deductible. There is also an ADT net operating loss impacting about 3.9% and the impact of the tax extender benefit impact which is about 2.6%. That gets you to a normalized rate of 27.3% which is why we have highlighted that and that’s what Don will talk to in the guidance in terms of that should be your expectation going forward. Looking at margins on the next page we think it’s important to note pretty strong gross margin of 39.4% for the combined company, as noted in the press release on a legacy Stanley basis continued its positive trend about 40.8% on a standalone basis. So we remain encouraged with the margin performance and Jim’s going to talk about some of the drivers of that as he reviews the various segment results. Operating margin remains fairly constant around 13%. So, we’re in a good place as we begin to go forward and combine these two companies and report to you on a combined basis. The cost synergy drivers are I think important to everyone. This chart is essentially unchanged from what we have presented on two or three occasions. So I won’t spend a lot of time on it, other than to emphasize a few points. We continue to feel confident in our $350 million estimate for synergies, but there have been so many questions as well as the cost to achieve it at not exceeding $400 million over the three year timeframe.  But there have been enough questions on the $350 million but I just wanted to shed a little more light on it. As Don will point out in his guidance we are going to realize about $90 million of that $350 million during calendar 2010. So the majority of the year one achievement that we previously put in our model of course we only have nine months.  But in the nine months 2010 we’re looking for about $90 million of benefit. But relating to the $350 in total first of all it’s a very big number and as a consequence it’s not easy. And I think its important to point out, if one just does, back of envelope math against the purchased base or the cost base and comes up with a number, it’s really important to note, there’s a couple of very large areas where there is absolutely no overlap at all between the two legacy companies. I mean one example and a good one is batteries in the purchasing area, our legacy Black & Decker spends about $300 million a year on nickel cadmium and lithium iron batteries Stanley spends essentially nothing, its anecdotal but its just an example of an area where there is no overlap, and on an business basis, the convergent security business is $800 million in revenue with essentially no overlap whatsoever with the legacy Black & Decker business.  So the base against which to focus on the up further synergies is actually smaller than one might realize at first blush. And the $350 million is a fairly aggressive number. Second the cost to achieve synergies in excess of $300 million may render the returns for those programs or those investments and those expenses unattractive. So while the number could be driven higher it may not be in the best interest of the company to do it and last but certainly now least as Jim will point out to the extent we achieve additional cost synergies we may well choose to reinvest to those synergies in growth initiatives as we referred to in our press release.  We intend to grow this combined business as soon as we’ve got our synergy targets fairly embedded in the P&L. Looking at the status of integration over the first six weeks, we are quite pleased with where we are, let’s hope it’s on some of the major milestones, the first being customers and employees are very-very simply said our primary objective is to protect our core. We’ve executed on a goal of a smooth close in the first thirty days as a combined company going well. We’ve been proactive and positive with communication with employees and customers, numerous town hall meetings and market visits, Jim myself, Don Allen and the senior management team have spent as much time as ever in our careers in front of our employees and in front of customers. It’s a very important part of the integration and we will continue to do that for the foreseeable future. And importantly let’s avoid pitfalls we have thus far no major pitfalls and no major surprises, now that we are five weeks post close. Focusing on the cost synergies we have finalized the bottoms up synergy identification process and that will be presented to the executive steering committee in late May. As a reminder Brett Bontrager on the Stanley side who has got a wealth of experience in major integrations for Stanley and Tony Milando who was formerly head of operations for the worldwide power tools and accessories business co-leading this integration process, they are reporting to a steering committee of six people that include Jim Loree, myself, Don Allan, Mark Mathieu, Massimo Grassi in Europe and of course Nolan Archibald from Black & Decker who brings all the experience from that organization to bear on the synergies and the targets and what’s a good business decision and what isn’t.  That group meets quite regularly, there are 13 sub-teams focused on either businesses or functions. And as those of you who are familiar with our company know it’s a very-very important part of the rhythm and rigor with which we integrate acquisitions and we’re putting the best team we can on the field to ensure that this process continues and that its given the utmost detention from the top of the house right down to the folks executing the programs. Thus far all our findings have supported that $350 million target. Regarding the execution, we rigorously attract the cost synergy extraction and are quite sure that we are quantifying appropriately and not double counting. We are eagerly and rapidly deploying the Stanley fulfillment system on the Black & Decker base. I am really pleased to say that Black & Decker had a focus on operational excellence, it was their internal terminology, the elements and the fundamentals of SFS are being embraced, I think there is broad scale understanding of the benefits it has had the legacy Stanley over the last three to four years.  And that it can have on the business with a very similar geographic and customer base. So far so good on that, and last but certainly not least we’ve identified or beginning to identify the revenue synergies and corresponding plans to get them. And I think it will come as no surprise that once the cost synergies are identified and we’re clear that they are on track, it’s more inspirational, it’s more motivating, and it’s more fun to grow the business than to take cost out of it. So there’s been tremendous support around this initiative. So, so far so good, we are underway. No major pitfall. Looking very quickly at the geographical breakdown the purpose of this chart is to say that combining these two companies didn’t have a tremendous impact geographically on the companies on a standalone basis. Specifically the large purple section of the pie showing 56%, Legacy Stanley, Legacy Black & Decker were between 55 and 57% of their business in the U.S. prior to the merger.  The primary difference being Stanley had a slightly larger presence in Europe and Black & Decker had a meaningfully larger presence in Latin America. But when you combine the two companies, you see that the U.S. is about 56% of the revenue, Europe is 25% and then Latin America, Canada, Australia adding to 14 and Asia and the Rest of the World adding to, excuse me, the Rest of the World including the 14 and Asia about 5%. Looking at our businesses by segment, again I think just two important points to make here on this chart. Even as a combined entity, we remain a diversified global leader and second, it is not a departure or an abandonment of Stanley’s strategy to continue to diversify into higher growth emerging markets and businesses.  Specifically, if we look at CDIY, which includes the legacy Stanley’s CDIY business, the legacy Black & Decker worldwide power tools and accessory business and the Price Pfister business which historically Black & Decker reported within hardware and home improvement, it makes up 58% of the combined total of the company on a 2009 revenue basis.  Security which is basically all of Stanley’s Legacy security business, both mechanical and convergent, plus Black & Decker hardware and home improvement less Price Pfister, making up about 25% of the business and industrial which included Stanley’s industrial portfolio and essentially the MR Technologies business making up 17% of the business.  The chart in the bottom to me at least is very important and it’s very important that everyone understands it. In 2002, the large home centers in mass merchants, 7 customers represented 40% of Legacy’s Stanley’s revenue and the largest customer represented 22%.  By the end of 2008, as Stanley diversified its portfolio, those numbers became 13 and 6% respectively. Adding Black & Decker, 2009 base on a pro-forma basis moves those numbers back to 31% of the combined companies business as through U.S. home centers and mass merchants and 12% through our largest customer.  Not a tremendously concentrated business I think by most standards and while, we can say it’s a step back, all it does is put Stanley where it was at about 2006 in its evolution. Its certainly not an abandonment of Stanley’s strategy diversified, its simply a reflection of the math and that Stanley’s been able to merge with a great company and a great set of brands at a very opportunistic time in the cycle.  Our strategy going forward will remain exactly as it’s been in the past and as we’ve pointed out on many times to continue to grow, to continue to diversify our portfolio and take some of the volatility out of our end results.  Looking quickly at first quarter revenues, I think the good news is here they are stabilizing versus the dramatic declines of 2009. The chart on the top I think shows that clearly from a holistic point of view but more importantly if we look at the segment results, what we see is the four sequential quarters for both revenues and volumes starting in 2Q 09 going through the first quarter and the first quarter results of course, reflect the addition of 3 weeks of Black & Decker, so the CDIY business and the industrial business are a little bit less representative, Jim’s going to talk about that in just a minute but I think the important point to note is that within security, the rate of decline is slowing down dramatically.  The mix is strong, customer attention is as good or better than it’s ever been. And it’s obviously a less volatile business than CDIY or industrial, it serves Stanley extraordinarily well on the last couple of years with a less perceptive decline. And as a consequence the recovery, the market based recovery within the security business will be slightly slower.  But we are highly confident that it’s there and in the mean time a very strong customer attention and a very solid mix in terms of recurring revenue. It’s keeping on the margins of that business and a very-very safe place. So I am going to turn it over Jim Loree who is going to take you through both per segment results and add a little more clarity on the legacy businesses because we think that will provide some good insight into how the companies performed on the standalone basis right up until the transaction close.
Jim Loree: Okay. Thank you John, let’s start with construction in DIY, the story here was very positive, twofold, Legacy Stanley drove a 470 basis point improvement in the OM rate on a negative 2% organic volume growth. And Black & Decker performed exceptionally well adding $30.9 million to operating margin and having an accretive impact on the operating margin rate. So let’s break it down if we move to revenues we came in at 561 in this segment with an 85% increase 82 points of which were associated with BDK, five points currency, thus the minus 2% organic and that was about minus 1% price and about minus 1% unit volume.  Segment profit was up a 189%. If you take out a substantial contribution $39 million from the acquisition, if the actual rate was 14.2% and still a very impressive performance for the Legacy Stanley business as I said a 470 basis points. If we get in to the specifics the U.S. revenues and European revenues organically were both slightly negative, the Big-box customers in the U.S. continue to have tight inventory controls. Did not see a lot of rebuilding there, orders were modestly positive and new product development was strong, with the introduction of the Bostich hand tool line and Legacy segment profit improved 54% due to the dramatically lower over head that resulted from the significant cost takeouts over the last five quarters or so. Working capital was a good story going from about 2.5 turns a year ago to 6.8 turns with a $55 million inventory reduction versus prior year and only a $4 million increase in inventory sequentially versus the fourth quarter. So I think this is a very strong story here we will get into a little bit more color on the pro-forma Black & Decker performance in a few minutes. But I expect the next chapter for this segment will be operating leverage and as we look forward we are looking for a little more volume growth and as we get into the year so we should see some good operating leverage as we go forward here. So stay tuned for that.  Now interestingly as we look at security this quarter. One would say it was a challenging quarter, we expected that but ironically if we had this quarter two or three quarter ago we would have thought it was a pretty good quarter. So what’s essentially happened here is security continues to kind of plug along it was really the foundation that helped the company get through some of the difficult construction DIY industrial market conditions and it continues to be very strong and stable.  Revenues were up 11% all of the growth in the quarter was due to the addition of HHI into the results. Legacy Stanley also benefited from the ADT, France acquisition which contributed three points and currency which contributed 3 points and currency which contributed 3 points especially get to the minus 6% organic growth.  If you divide that or look at the components of that, both convergent and security of the electronic business and mechanical security, we’re both down roughly 6%. There were different stories, Convergent was relatively simple story, modest volume decline, slight RMR increased couple of points.  Stable operating margins, pretty much business as usual trying to get through the difficult market conditions but a nice aspect of the quarter for them was that the National account budget seemed to be loosening up a little bit which is good. However the core business which was the foundation of their volume story in the last year or so was week, so you had kind of a change in mix there due to that.  On the mechanical side, the volume decline was also expected but the operating margin did dip from about 20% in the prior year first quarter to 16%. Again a two-fold story here, absorption issues and the factories clearly contributed to that and then secondly some SG&A investments for growth, primarily for growth in Asia and for feet on the street in U.S. Got ahead of the growth curve which is not unexpected and perfectly fine, so that caused a temporary dip in the operating margin rate and we don’t see that as a continuing issue.  Now industrial I think was a very positive story. I think its also indicative of the first signs of what a few points of volume can do for operating margin growth in this type of a business what we call operating leverage and also a nice contribution from Black & Decker’s Emhart Technologies business which itself is rebounding in a very big way and again we’ll talk about the Black & Decker activities in just a minute. Revenues were up 22%, 16 points of that was from the MR contribution, 3 points currency, organic growth was positive, 3% and that led to a 54% segment profit increase and without the MR contribution a 25% segment profit increase which is fantastic and that would have been about $30 million of segment profit attributable to the Legacy industrial Stanley business and if you go to the segment profit rate, we increased from 10.4 to 13.2%, 280 basis points and about a 100 of that was associated with the Emhart contribution, so 12.2% operating margins for the core Stanley Legacy business there.  So pretty much the story on the volume was a rebound in Europe and at Proto with Europe up 6% in volume and Proto up 14%, we all know what’s happening in the industrial markets, it’s a strong story. I think a little bit of that obviously, maybe more than a little bit, was restocking and when we look at the GDP, its not quite up at those levels and then we did have some weakness in our Vidmar storage business and our hydraulics business, both the Vidmar issue being driven by government spending delays and the hydraulics just a cyclical business which is kind of which appears to be at the trough of the cycle right now.  Now I’m going to change gears here for a moment and we’re going to look at the pro-forma Black & Decker Legacy segment performance. And when we look at this page and I can’t help but think that the timing of this merger was excellent.  This chart shows the Black & Decker segments a rate on a full quarter over quarter, pro-forma basis. So this is how it would have looked had Black & Decker been a standalone business at this point in time and if we start with PT&A which is power tools and accessories which was a very large part of their business as you can see, they have 6% growth 1% organic growth, North America was the weakest part of the story although the consumer products group was strong.  Europe had a nice performance with positive 3% organic that was very encouraging. And Latin America was up 11% and Asia up 13% both bright spots. So good story there, hardware and home improvement shown here as HHI was up 12% mostly organic, U.S. Lock Set’s primarily the quick set Kwikset Baldwin business was up 14% and Price Pfister was up 9%. Nice product introduction, in the mid point price point range in Kwikset, as leading to some outstanding success in the marketplace and also some nice rebound in the markets as well. And if there was any rebound in the market story within Black & Decker’s Legacy businesses it was in the fastening in assembly segment which is also known as Emhart Teknologies and this is a business that sells productivity to industrial customers primarily automotive OEM it’s about two thirds driven by global automotive production and about a third driven by industrial production.  And the story of course in the quarter was that the at the global vehicle demand was up 42% around the world with North America is up 62%, Europe up 25% and Japan up 53% thus Emhart which has historically been a mid teens operating margin performer, quickly rebounded from a trough last year of 2% to 14% very impressive performance from the folks at Emhart largely market driven but they took out a lot of cost in that business and they have got a cost structure that’s really in a good place. So truly a terrific performance from our new colleagues from Black & Decker, this morning there were a lot of questions about how could this margin be so rich. And the story is very simple these folks took out about $300 million, slightly more than $300 billion of cost from the last five or six quarters before the merger. And their cost structure is in great shape and a little volume is going to go a long way towards big profit improvements in that part of the business. Another great story for the quarter in my view was working capital in the legacy Stanley business. You may recall for those of you that have been following the company that Stanley closed out last year at 7.9 turns we typically will have at least a point reduction in the turns as we go in to the end of the first quarter with the seasonal bills and so forth.  We were able to contain that to a much smaller increase, closed at 7.3 turns and that’s up from 4.8 last year so a real nice performance there you can see good news in all fronts, inventory down 25%, receivables down 14, payables up 10% that’s good. Total 34% reduction from 762 down to 504, but I just want to emphasize that these improvements are process driven by the Stanley fulfillment system. And we don’t have the time this morning to delve into Stanley fulfillment system in great detail or the folks that aren’t familiar with it. However will note there is a new section in the web-based annual report that we are issuing that we’ll give you a lot of insight into Stanley fulfillment system if you are interested in learning more about it. But as we move to the next page here we can see that there is one huge opportunity and John alluded to it earlier and that is that rigorous deployment of the Stanley fulfillment system across the newly added Black & Decker entities will provide a huge opportunity for the company. As you can see the combined working capital of the companies although with a nice reduction from last year is right around $1.9 billion and that’s comprised of $0.5 billion of Stanley, Legacy, working capital and $1.4 billion of Black & Decker Legacy working capital.  Now a little math, if we just annualize the first quarter for illustrative purposes, we would have $8.8 billion of annualized revenues. If we could get to the 7.9 turns that we ended the year at, that would free up $1.1 billion in cash, I mean it would free up $800 million in cash because it would be $1.1 billion.  So 1.9 minus, 1.1 is 800 million but I will also emphasize that this is, well its an objective, it is also a journey, and not an overnight sensation, as I mentioned, SFS is process driven. It took us 3 years to get from 4.5 turns to 7.9 but we as John mentioned, have begun the journey here and it is a very do-able journey with a very positive outcome and now I will turn it over to Don Allan, our Senior Vice President, CFO to go through some of the financial aspects of the quarter. 
Don Allan: Thank you Jim. First thing I’d like to do is start with our balance sheet on a combined basis. We feel really good about our financial position going into the new company and moving forward.  As you can see at the bottom of the page, our debt to capital ratio is 35%. We adjusted for the hybrid instruments that we have at 31%, exactly where we were hoping we would be as we put the two companies together, post merger.  A few other items of note here of significance obviously there are some large dollar variances on the balance sheet by merging the two companies when you compare to the first quarter of last year.  The largest changes have to do in other assets where the goodwill and the intangibles are recorded at about $5.6 billion as well as the Black & Decker working capital components being added in there about $2.4 billion on the asset side of the balance and then equity, clearly the issuance of the equity associated with the merger of $4.5 billion is increasing our equity and that’s really what’s driving the debt to capital ratio coming down from where we were last year at this point in time.  So we feel very good starting out our financial position as we move forward. For free cash flow in the first quarter, this chart depicts what free cash flow was excluding one time payments.  We had approximately $92 million of one time payments related to the merger and if you exclude that effect, the free cash flow was $37 million. Operating cash flow was $59 million which was an improvement of $55 million year-over-year in the first quarter of 2009 and you can see that its driven by a net income increase and John and Jim just walked through some of the details in that area and working capital was significant negative in the first quarter in $90 million which is a normal of trend for both companies, they tend to have a working capital negative in the first quarter as certain inventories get billed going into the second quarter and then just the timing of the sales related to AR as we have a large sales month in March and that could drive our receivables up at the end of the first quarter.  So pretty much as planned with our working capital in Q1. Touching on the ADT France acquisition on the next page, it’s not a large acquisition but it’s something important that we should talk about briefly.  It really is a continuation of our strategy within security to expand our footprint internationally. We’ve talked to many of you over the last year or two that’s an important part of our initiative and overall strategies within security and this acquisition really allows us to continue to take that step forward.  By combining ADT France and GDP together, we’re creating the largest market share company in France by doing that. GDP brings a strong core commercial orientation and then ADT has a very strong national account orientation. So by deploying these two companies together they mix well together from that perspective. The revenues are expected to be in 2010 to be about $125 to $135 million as I’ll go through in more detail later. Last year’s revenues in 09 were 132 million euro, about $175 million and the RMR component it is about 45%. As John mentioned earlier the accretion should be about $0.07 to $0.08 by year three as we look to remove about $35 million of cost by pulling the two companies together which would allow the operating margin to be approximately 20%. Once the synergies are completely removed. We feel we have a really strong and experienced management team in France that can drive this integration, improve their worth in the GDP acquisition that we did a few years ago and integrating them in to our worldwide business. And now then have the ADT France business integrated in to their local operations. The last thing I will leave you with there is a dilutive impact associated with operating margins related to the acquisition in 2010. It could be as much 150 to 200 basis points in 2010 to the CSS business and to the overall segment about 75 to 100 basis points. But that’s just a one year phenomena as we go in to 2011 and 2012 we would expect the operating margin CSS to get back to 20% bar that we have established. We feel very good about that acquisition as we head in to this year. The next page is really the way that we begun to summarize some of the trends that we are seeing in our three different segments and then after that I will walk in to the guidance in a little more detail. We start with the CDIY segment, I want to leave you with two or three thoughts here as we head in to 2010 and beyond. We believe that we are starting to see an improvement in top line in our CDIY segment. And we expect mid single digit growth in revenue and that would be total growth on an organic basis and including currency. It does not include any impact of acquisitions going forward. So this would be on a pro-forma basis. We also are seeing continued recovering and merging markets around the world. So we expect growth to be stronger in emerging markets in both hand tools as wells as power tools and Bostich around the world. We don’t expect the U.S. and mature markets in Europe as well to grow as significantly, but we do expect some modest growth in those particular markets. And as always we continue to be very focused on new product development, innovation and making sure that those roll outs help us drive more market share gains as we move forward. Industrial as Jim mentioned we are beginning to see a little bit effect of re-stocking throughout the supply chain. We start that in the month of March in particular in FACOM and Proto. And we believe these indications allow us to forecast or predict possibility of a high single digit revenue growth in this segment in 2010. This customer re-stocking is primarily the industrial portion of our businesses the automotive component has not been as strong but we do believe that it’s coming likely in the second quarter. In the Engineered Fastening business we saw significant increase in light vehicle production in the first quarter we expect that trend to continue compared to the prior year and the second quarter and the third quarter which would drive revenue growth. And then a small acquisition in Engineer Fastening called FIT which really allows us to diversify ourselves stuff little bit away from the automotive manufacturing environment in aerospace it is a strategy that will continue to look as we move forward as a company.  Security talked a little bit about this already related to ADT, France but the transit I am listening here do not include the effects of ADT, France so revenue, we actually expect to decline slightly in our security business this year. This is late cycle business as many of you know and the economic recovery will come a little bit later as we’re seeing some of the economic recovery in our CDIY business and industrial, we expect securities to see it either later this year or early next year.  So as a result, we will have a small single digit revenue decline throughout 2010. We are seeing recovery in the core commercial accounts and lagging international account customer base. Installation revenues continue to improve slightly but not significantly. I talked about the integration ADT France acquisition already and you can see the impact financially in 2010, there will be a slight drag in our operating margins as I mentioned.  A clearly commercial construction continues to be a drag on this segment and it’s an area that we continue to focus on but we are also focusing on other verticals such as education and health care to try to offset the impact of that. While moving to our guidance for 2010 on the next page. Excluding one time charges and cost, we believe the EPS guidance for 2010 is $3.10 and $3.30 and underlining some of the assumptions in that you can see on this page, we start with the first section at the top, the remaining nine months of 2010, so this is just for the upcoming three quarters.  We believe the net sales will increase 4 to 5% on a pro-forma merge company basis and that excludes the impact on ADT France and that will include the impact of currency which we would expect to be relatively immaterial for the remainder of the year but I’ll talk about that a little bit later as it relates to the Chinese RMB. ADT France will contribute a $125 to $135 million of sales and will be modestly diluted to EPS in 2010.  We believe our gross margins on a combined basis for the next nine months will range between 37 and 38% and so you see the blending effect of putting the two companies together Stanley and Black & Decker as it mixes our Stanley gross margin rate down from the 41 to 40% category that its been in the last two or three quarters.  But we also expect to experience some significant commodity inflation for the remainder of the year and if the Chinese RMB does revalue, that could be a significant pressure as well. So we’ve forecasted the potential for a 5% RMB revaluation which equates to approximately $42 million on an annualized basis.  Exactly the timing of that and when that will happen is difficult to predict but we’ve assumed about 2/3rds of that in our guidance. With that being said with commodity inflation coming and revaluation of Chinese currency, we’re very proactive of looking at how we can pass on some of these increases to our customer base as we’ve done as a company for the last two to four years.  It continues to be something that we’re focused on and we’ll continue to do that throughout 2010 but there clearly will be a lag in the timing of that as we’re tended to see during its significant inflationary periods. One fact I’ll leave you with related to inflation is that when you look at the steel components that we buy, to compare the average cost in the first quarter to the fourth quarter of last year, the increases have been about 7 to 10%.  We haven’t experienced that as a company but if you look at what’s happening on the commodity markets, those are the percentage increases that we’re seeing. If you compare the first quarter averages to the third quarter of last year, increase is around 25%. So there’s clearly as inflationary pressures that are coming.  We need to be proactive about how we pass those increases onto our customers and that’s something that we’re very focused on. Two other items to note related to this nine month period, the tangible amortization of approximately $55 million and as John mentioned, the cost synergy impact in calendar 2010 will be $90 million. That’s about 90% of that $90 million will impact SG&A.  Looking at the full year, the bottom part of the page, our share count clearly is going to increase as a result of the merger but we also have the previously announced issuance of about six million shares related to our equity unit hybrid instrument that will occur in May of 2010. So the average outstanding share is approximately $150 million.  The tax rate should be about 26 to 27% as John mentioned earlier, the normalized Q1 tax rate was around 27%. So really, we’ll be consistent with what we experienced in the first quarter. And in the impact of foreign currency, we would expect to be utilized current exchange rates.  We would expect that to be relatively minimal. Now that excludes the effect of the Chinese RMB. Anything that happens related to that is outside of that secret assumption. And then last, the structuring and related charges is not associated with Black & Decker or ADT, France will be about $30 to $40 million.  So the free cash flow assumption related to this, when you factor in these particular EPS guidance and excluding the effect of the one time charges and payments will be about $600 million for the merged company in 2010. The next page is a summary of the one time charges that we expect for the full year of 2010. And if you look at our GAAP, EPS forecast for guidance, we believe that we would be anywhere from a loss of $0.41 to a slight gain of $0.05 based on the exact outcome of these charges that was our remainder of the year.  And they’re really broken down into three different components. The first is just restructuring cost associated with severing employees as well as closing facilities. And the range there is $245 to $295 million, $90 million of which we’ve actually incurred in the first quarter of 2010.  Then we have one time cost of SG&A and the category that we call other net flow operating margins of a $100 million which relates to certain executive comp charges and investment banking fees and other advisory consulting fees that we’re utilizing for the integration process. A vast majority of that was actually incurred in the first quarter about $81 million.  So we had $90 million of additional cost for the remainder of the year. And then last, an accounting charge related to inventory where we actually step up the value and purchase accounting. It’s a non-cash charge, will be a $170 million, $42 million of that was the report in first quarter.  So, on a cash EPS basis excluding these different charges, we believe that the cash EPS will be $4.89 to $5.09. That assumes about $370 million of depreciation and amortization.  So to summarize this morning’s call, we feel that we’ve been very, we made successful progress in beginning the execution of the integration with Black & Decker. We believe the $350 million cost synergy target is achievable. As I mentioned related to trends we are seeing selected customer re-stocking activity in our industrial channel and signs of a bit of a pick up in the end markets that allows us to feel that a 4 to 5% revenue growth for the remainder of 2010 is reasonable.  We’re focused on strong new product launches to gain market share and boost that top line growth as much as we can. And as Jim mentioned, the operating leverage is something that we’re very focused on and we saw a bit of demonstration of that in the first quarter in CDIY industrial.  And then last but certainly not least, SFS we believe will play a very significant role in the successful integration of Black & Decker as well as our objectives around working capital. So with that we conclude the presentation portion of this morning’s call. 
Kate White: Thank you all, its time for Q&A Louisa.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research:  Two things, first of all can you talk about the sustainability of the margin improvement which was quite remarkable in the core CDIY business as well as in the Power Tool business of Black & Decker, Power Tool business? Obviously you talked about cost improvement contributing to that but can you talk about the sustainability of what are pretty strong levels of profitability in those businesses?
John Lundgren: You said two things Eric.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: That's the first part. There's a second part as well which hopefully I'll be able to ask once you're done with that. 
John Lundgren:  Jim why don’t you talk about COE and everything else that contributes to that?
Jim Loree:  Clearly the story as I mentioned in my remarks, has everything to do with the fact that on a combined basis, these companies you know took out well over $600 million of costs, close to $700 million of cost in the last six quarters before the end of the year.  So that cost is obviously not all coming back and when the volume comes in, there is some cost add backs and both of the businesses but we’re here to enjoy some operating leverage and make some selective reinvestments in growth as we move forward and we will monitor and allocate those growth reinvestments as we go but the expectation here is that we’ve gone through a lot of pain both organizations over the last couple of years and we expect to enjoy the fruits on a more granular basis when you get into gross margins, both companies have a tried and true productivity regiment, somewhat different, we’re taking the best of the best and putting them together in those cases.  I think Stanley has probably been a little more Legacy Stanley, has been a little more focused on pricing core competency in the organization and I think we have some opportunities to drive that through the new company and help drive some positive improvement in gross margins in particular in that area but I would also say that I think that inflation is something that we all need to be as Don pointed out, we all need to be cognizant that as this economy heats up, we’re already seeing the early signs of commodity inflation, so there will be some puts and takes here as we go and we’re probably not going to get a 100% price recovery just like we didn’t get a 100% price recovery in legacy Stanley since 04, we got 80%.  We can get somewhere between 60 and 80% as a combined company, I think we’ll be doing quite well but it’ll be a lag time in that regard and that’s why Don’s guidance may seem a little cautious to some folks, including you Eric based on something I read. I think its probably appropriate, I think the margin rates that we’re at today certainly seems sustainable to us but you know we’re three weeks into our relationship here, so you know time will tell.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research:  And I guess the follow up, when you originally presented the targets, I think the original presentation was that there would be, I’m looking at a slide that said $0.20 to $0.45 of dilution in year one and there’s a lot of moving parts with these numbers I understand but can you help us understand how this guidance is up from the core Stanley Works guidance for 2010 the stand alone guidance you gave out of 4Q and so it looks like your guidance suggests that this is going to be accretive, the combination will be accretive in year one and the original guidance was for dilution, hopefully that’s clear enough but can you just talk about what that is relative to where we started?
John Lundgren: There’s a lot of puts and takes there. But Don will give you more granularity on that, we expected that question.
Don Allan: Eric, your exactly right, its part of the November guidance we provided. We did believe that they would be dilutive in year one, but keep in mind as you know there were some pretty conservative assumptions around top line growth in that November guidance around 2%. Total growth for the entire combined company in year one. Now obviously we are looking at growth rates that are more around four to five percent. Additionally we are starting to see the effects of the leverage from that volume, so you can begin to see the accretive impact of that. And that’s really what’s driving that $0.25 to $0.30 improvement from what we were thinking back in November of last year.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research: Perfect that’s great, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open.
Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott:  Thanks a lot. And thank you for a lot of good material in preparation for this because I know a lot has to go into making this into a coherent form to us outsiders. First question, if we look within the CDIY business, you commented that you're not seeing a lot of orders in the home center channel.  Could you comment on the sell-through of what you're seeing there? And then the second question big picture as it relates to synergies, if you could comment early read on revenue synergies, of what you're thinking there? And with regards to SFS, how long do you think it takes Black & Decker to get the rhythm that Stanley has from an SFS standpoint?
John Lundgren: Jim this is John. I never heard four questions knocked in so quickly, well we don’t have you on the buzzer but, let me try them all and Jim will jump into help. In terms of restocking and sell through, it’s a little early as you know and everyone on the call knows the home centers close their fiscal books at the end of January which is always a relatively soft month for we as suppliers in terms of volume.  So when we shift in February and March we do believe its helping with restocking. In terms of POS all I will say is there is nothing out of the ordinary yet. And I don’t want to say any more than that, the simple reason being without inventory there can’t be any sell through and inventories have been so low up until about March that we think POS has been constrained, of our lack of inventory at retail.  So we’ve seen no dramatic increases, we’ve seen no decreases but the simple answer is it’s one to three months early to make any kind of I would say projection or draw any kind of conclusion based on that. And I hope that its clear, so modest restocking, constant sell through, we think we are going, it’s going to take a few months of inventories. Being at a more robust level in the stores before we can expect the kind of POS lift that we are hoping to see. In terms of revenue synergies its early days, we’ve been in I would say file and agreement across the two companies that they are there as I referenced they are more, it’s much more motivating and inspirational to work on revenue synergies.  But I have to say first and foremost, we need to be sure the cost synergy plans are in place. They are being executed and that’s embedded. We’ve only recently since we’ve been able to put the two companies together at the very senior levels of management, top 12 people in the combined company established a process for identifying, re-sourcing and managing any potential conflict with revenue synergies relative to cost synergies.  Because conceivably one could get in the way or the other so there has to be a way to establish the appropriate priorities and to the extent of conflict exists resolve it. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, there’s actually a formal presentation at the end of May to the steering committee where we think we can, we will be a little bit more granular internally and that something material takes place.  Obviously, we’ll be public about it otherwise we’ll just talk about the status in out next quarterly review. Lastly in terms of timing for SFS, Jim said it best. It’s an evolution, it’s not a revolution. This is not a silver bullet, its not an overnight phenomenon, it’s a very, very long journey.  I’d like to think with the very willing audience and or if you will body and that’s the entire Black & Decker operating and management team. They’ve seen the positive impact it’s had for Stanley over the last three years.  But I'll say our own experience. We started talking about it four years ago. We started really embedding it three years ago and it’s taken while the improvements been gradual, it’s taken three years to really, really, really see the fruit on those trees.  So I like to think we can do a little quicker because we have some more. As Jim pointed out, we’re applying it across a much, much larger base. So that’s going to have an impact as well but I think it’s going to be 12 to 18 months before its appropriate to see any process driven changes that the result of SFS and I think you can expect steady improvement from there.
Jim Loree:  And I think everyone needs to understand that when you’re implementing $350 million of Synergies in a $9 billion company, while it may not sound like much on a percentage basis, its really all consuming and hence we’re putting off the revenue synergy, deep dive kind of planning process, a couple of months and SFS may take a little bit longer to implement their cross to platform because we can’t do everything at once.  So we’re trying to sequence these things in a rational and orderly manner. But there is that huge opportunity out there and I think also the fact that there are fewer skewers in the power tool business than in the hand tool business will help us, the fact that we got the experience, the joint reference will help us expedite.  But it’s going to be a very large undertaking and it will take at least, somewhere in the range of probably 18 to 24, maybe 36 months to get it done to that level.  And the last thing I would just comment on the revenue synergies a little bit. I had the opportunity to spend about four weeks visiting far flung regions of the world and meeting the Black & Decker folks and learning about their business in great detail around the world and starting to kind of frame out what the revenue synergy areas might.  And I think there’s five really significant ones and some more that I don’t know about yet that will kind of be surfaced during our betting process over the next few months. But they have a very strong organization in Latin America. They have production in Brazil which is expandable, they have a distribution center down there which we don’t have and for those of you that are familiar with Brazil, those are both enormously important assets in order to be successful in Brazil which is really on fire from a market growth perspective. So we will quickly, as quickly as possible take advantage of that opportunity to gain market share with the legacy Stanley business down in Latin America. The business leader down there is terrific. Likewise, in the Middle East and Dubai which covers the entire Middle East and Africa region for Legacy Black & Decker and now Stanley, Black & Decker. Very strong organizations in the Middle East as well and a good infrastructure significantly bigger and better than ours in the Middle East, we will leverage that as quickly as we can and in Asia, I think we find that both companies have fledgling operations there.  When we put them together, I think we have sufficient scale to have a meaningful growth initiative in Asia and really leverage off each other and our distribution channel access and our talent over there, we were fortunate enough to retain both leaders from Stanley Legacy and Black & Decker legacy Asia and we have them now kind of divided up that territory within both of their regions, so they both are now we have twice the senior talent working in Asia and the emerging markets and then closer to home, I think well really, that staff the channel is something that Stanley has coveted for a long time and aspire to do better in and the Bostich hand tool launch is just an example of something that’s really targeted at the staff channel but when you look at the Black & Decker relationships and the staff channel there are stronger then and their history is more successful in that channel than ours and so we hope to leverage that and then lastly in the industrial channels around the globe, as many of you know, Stanley has transformed its market approach in those channels to really drive a global platform approach across the regions and Black & Decker, well it has this entity called industrial power tools, its really far more construction oriented than some industrial but Stanley has much better channel access into the industrial and automotive repair channels across the world and we expect to leverage that as a revenue synergy as well.  So I hope that gives you a little color into some of the potential areas that could be very meaningful on a go forward basis.
Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Extremely helpful, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. 
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates:  Good morning, guys. Hi, the first question I was hoping, I believe you touched on the home center trends within the Hand Tool business, but I was hoping you could maybe talk about what you're seeing from point of sale and new orders particularly as you exited the quarter across all the businesses there including the legacy BDK that touches that end channel? And then I had a follow-up question as well. 
John Lundgren: I’ve said everything that we intend to say up about order and POS at this stage, it is as you know, it’s a very short cycle business, we’ve only had granularity at Black & Decker power tools, orders of POS for 3 weeks and as they say, at this stage restocking has been modestly encouraging but far less than in the industrial channels and its too early to have a view on POS because inventories are only being gradually restored and we have only 3 weeks of data to go on.
Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates:  Okay, fair enough. The second question, I believe in the press release you guided towards $600 million of free cash flow for the year. And I was wondering if you could maybe give us some puts and takes as far as what some of the bigger drivers there are and how we might think about that relative to I believe the $1billion or so that the combined entity generated last year?
John Lundgren: We’ll talk, there’s a lot of one times in the billion Dennis and obviously the targets of billion plus on an ongoing basis which is a year 3 but we’ve had a lot of discussion on that, Don’s going to give you some of the highlights of where we came out.
Don Allan : Dennis, the $600 million as I mentioned, was mentioned in the press release really has a very modest impact on our working capital included and so an assets what it is if you take the net income or EPS projections that we have, you add back the depreciation and amortization and subtract out CapEx, you pretty much get to that $600 million number and our CapEx tends to be anywhere between two and half percent of our revenue.  So even though the kind of boundary you will get to that number. The opportunity for us going forward is clearly continue top line growth and we are seeing the signs of that 2010 if these trends continue then we will have more growth in 11 and 12 but you know working capital is also a significant opportunity for us. And getting to the billion required a modest improvement in the Black & Decker working capital turns of about two turns. And that was really part of that projection that provided back in November. The other thing to keep in mind is that the performance last year of both companies had had on a combined basis about $450 million of working capital benefit in it and we don’t expect that at this point in time and that will peak 2010 but as we move forward as Jim mentioned there is a big opportunity for $800 million of cash flow from working capital.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank: I just wanted to echo the comments thanking you guys for all the disclosure, I know it probably required a lot of work. So maybe first of all you mentioned a little bit how you're expecting a little bit about your price inflation expectation for the full year. Is there any way you could provide some detail on pricing, when you're expecting to take pricing? Is that something that happens in the back half of the year?
John Lundgren: I guess Nicole always we try to be as far ahead of the curve as possible in order to maximize recovery of commodity’s inflation. Steel is as Don pointed out he, he quantified exactly how much it will be, how much we think it will be, what’s built in to our projections. But RMB is huge obviously with product both from our competitors and ourselves sourced from Asia, 5% RMB inflation, its $42 million on an annualized basis. The simple thing to say is when we see that inflation coming it will take one to three months for it to hit our cost of goods.  We would be out trying to announce and implement pricing. The second we see it coming, if you assume a six month lag in some customers from the day we announced till the day we get it. We have a three months gap to fill and that’s what, Don’s trying to improve. So simply said we try to be equal to or ahead of the curve, we’ve done a good job, over the last three or four years driven by the central pricing Center of Excellence and people from that organization being embedded within each of the business units. And that’s were we’ll stay, we’ll try to stay equal to or ahead of the curve and both commodities and RMB inflation are going to be very, very big external factors or market driven factors to look at. Importantly as it relates to the impact of RMB inflation, we are not in this alone, anyone whether its private label of the home centers or a foreign competition in CDIY they are going to be impacted as much or more as we are.  So while the numbers are big the forces in the marketplace will, our presence that will suggest we won’t be alone in the need to achieve pricing to maintain margin.
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank: Okay thanks, John, that's really helpful. And then maybe if you could comment a little bit on how Power and CDIY core growth in 1Q compared to your internal plans? I guess I was a little surprised by the volume declines given the mid-to-high single-digit growth we've seen out of both Danaher and Cooper this quarter?
Jim Loree: Well let me start by saying that both Danaher and Cooper are far more industrial oriented than our CDIY business if you look at their before the JV’s their portfolios and when you combine it together it doesn’t change anything.  So you have to really if you want to get a Danaher, Cooper, Stanley, Black & Decker comparison or at least Stanley Legacy comparison. You really have to kind of blend the CDIY and the industrial results and I think you saw the surge in our industrial business as well which was very comparable to what they experienced. 
Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank:  Okay. That’s fair. And lastly for me, what sort of seasonal pick up do you guys expect for security in the second quarter?
John Lundgren:  It’s always the case that versus two in a, obviously not versus 2Q 09, but 1Q to 2Q, we get historically a good seasonal pick up in our mechanical security business. I think Black & Decker hardware and home improvement business will be a little bit less seasonal than Stanleys.  Specifically, ours is driven hard as you know by two things in Legacy Stanley. The tremendous penetration we have on university campuses and mechanical locking and most of that takes place in June and July which spills into the third quarter where we get on to the campuses to change a lot of locks.  That will be less Black & Decker’s mechanical security business will not be tremendously impacted by that. The second point being our access technologies business which we love tends to have a far greater performance in the second and third quarters than first and fourth and its all weather related.  We have never had any slide availability issues when we go to install or in some cases, service doors or retro fit doors. That goes away. So what you’ve seen on the Stanley side historically, we would expect again whilst we expect very little of it on the Black & Decker side.  Their mechanical security business is less university and large retail oriented. So essentially on our combined basis that the percentage increase which we often attribute to 100 to 200 basis, is cut in half just due to the business twice the size. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenhiem with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Dan Oppenhiem - Credit Suisse: Thanks very much. You talked a lot about this in terms of the CDIY and the encouraging signs in terms of inventory circumstance happening much more on the Industrial side. In this guidance of 4% to 5% revenue growth for the remaining three quarters of the year is there any customer restocking built into that or are you assuming that it takes place later on? 
Don Allan:  Well, there is obviously is a little bit of customer restocking built into that. And clearly, we experience a little bit of that in the first quarter. And then, what we were to expect that continue in the second quarter and third quarter but I would say that a vast majority of that is really end market pick up.
Dan Oppenhiem - Credit Suisse:  Thanks very much. And I guess the other question, just wondering about the, and think about the Power Tools. You talk about product launches helping to regain some market share. Do you think that as you deal with the Big-box retailers is your thought at this point that having the right products and those interests will help to you regain the market share, or is there anything different you're looking at with the relationship with them?
John Lundgren: 
 : So, on the one hand was slow to convert to the emerging technology of lithium-ion one of the reasons being the franchise that it had to protect. The products are available, the pipe line is full. These are the, this is the most powerful and sought after brand in the professional channel that’s the DeWALT brand of course. And we believe not due to the effect that we’re a larger company, we due to the fact that that we’re a larger company, we do due to the fact that Legacy of Stanley brands and DeWALT brands are the most sought after brands in the industry and we have every hope and expectation to gain share as a result of that as we’re able to put these two companies together and introduce our new products.  You’ll recall from following Stanley historically new product launches take place in March and October and we start to see the benefits of that in the second obviously and fourth quarters. Every year about $100 million in revenue on the Legacy Stanley CDIY side has been generated from new products, we see no reasons why that shouldn’t continue going forward.
Jim Loree: And these DeWALT folks and also Black & Decker power tool folks are very proud and capable people and they didn’t take it very kindly when they missed this window which has cost them some market share points over a year and a half and I can tell you that the passion they have for what they do is going to be manifested in some outstanding new products and I think they’re going to regain their market share both through product and also they had reduced a lot of their brand support in taking costs out and a lot of that brand support, its not a cost synergy per say and its not a revenue synergy per say, we are able to leverage a lot of our existing brand support assets such as our MLB programs we will see with DeWALT in four parts, probably already have and also in our premier football over in Europe, you’ll see DeWALT at the games now and so around the world in our Nascar you’ll see the same thing. So we really are beefing up the brand support, at the same time the products are going at a nice, I expect that will help the market share as well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird: I guess first question if we could just go back to the revenue synergies and you laid out those five as sort of the targets. I'm wondering if those are more, are they plug and play sort of initiatives. In other words, what sort of capital costs should we think about as you try to enter some of these or take advantage of some of these strategic opportunities?
John Lundgren:  Pete, there’s good news and bad news there. The good news is there’s essentially no capital required to do what Jim talked about and I think he articulated extraordinarily well and that’s the positive.  The negative is a lot of experience sitting around this table and throughout our combined entities, say as logical as it is and as easy as it sounds, it takes two to three times as long to realize those synergies as Mike’s seen reasonable at first blush.  A lot of cross training on product, a lot of the fact that folks know and understand their legacy customers and product lines, that they need to be properly incented to go achieve these synergies without losing focus on the core business and as if you will qualitative or subjective as that all sounds, Jim and I and all the folks at Black & Decker, particularly in the regions, have all had the same experience.  It takes longer because it is not as easy as it sounds. We will get there with very little capital but its all about protecting the core while we layer this on and get out of them as soon as we can. We’ll have a better flavor for what those are and how quickly we might achieve them as we live together for 3 to 6 months as opposed to 3 to 6 weeks. So stay tuned and at some point in time particularly when we get the entire investment community together for an Analyst Day, who knows a year from now and we put out some new three year projections we will have a lot more granularity on that for you. But no capital, longer time than you might be tempted to put in your model.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird: No, totally understand. Thanks for that color. If we could just get back to the I guess the cash flow commentary where I'm a little bit, I see some optimism, guess you're doing $600 million in free cash flow this year.  And Jim, you talked about an opportunity of freeing up $800 million, but you also laid out a target of $1 billion pro-forma. Can you, you sort of set the bars for us when you're talking about the cost savings synergies and how to think about that. Can you also give us some of the puts and takes and why we shouldn't be more optimistic than your $1 billion target on the free cash flow front?
Don Allan: Peter this is Don. I think it’s really going to depend on what happens over the next few years and clearly there is significant cost synergies. Jim laid out some of the working capital opportunities that we have as a company.  But also we have to keep in mind that those working capital opportunities will take some time to achieve. We feel comfortable that we can achieve a lot of them, but the actual to ability to achieve them in a 24 month period is much different than ultimately achieving them, so those are all factors that need to be considered as well as the volume pick up that we might experience as a company for the next two to three years, little bit of question mark. So there is different way that you can model it to be more optimistic clearly that we get you to something greater than a billion.  But at this point in time we still think that number makes a lot of sense and as time evolves as we go forward we will continue to update as we see appropriate.

We’ve also added a new option for you to be able to listen to the replay. You can download it as a Podcast from I-tunes and even set up a subscription for all future replays of calls that we post. You can access this within I-tunes itself by typing in Stanley Works in the search window or from the link on our website. This should be posted within 24 hours. And as always, please feel free to contact me with any follow up questions after today’s call at my number which is 860-827-3833. Lastly, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today, and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K which we have filed with today’s press release and in our most recent ’34 Act. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.
John Lundgren: Thanks Kate. Let’s start by looking briefly at some highlights from the fourth quarter and the full year 2009. First, as it relates to the fourth quarter, we recorded diluted EPS of $0.89. That does exclude $0.22 related to the transaction and integration planning costs primarily associated with the Black & Decker merger. Diluted EPS from continuing operations on a GAAP basis then was $0.67. I think important to note, $0.04 to $0.05 of the $0.89 was an unanticipated tax benefit and the remainder of the tax benefit was included in our guidance as explained in the press release, and that we’ll cover in a little bit more detail later on in this morning’s presentation. So for the year, diluted EPS was $2.80 versus $2.74 in 2008 again excluding the $0.22 per share in the fourth quarter related to the Black & Decker transaction. Fourth quarter was $0.89 and for the year that brought us to $3.02 which did include the gain of the debt extinguishment reported in the second quarter 2009. So EPS for the year up 10% versus 2008 excluding the fourth quarter charges and 2% on a GAAP basis including those charges. Quarterly gross margin rate 40.7% was quite encouraging and it was our second consecutive quarter above 40%. Pricing, cost productivity initiatives and commodity deflation all continued to offset the impact of the volume under absorption and that led us to a record annual gross margin for the year of 40.4%. Cash flow was encouraging as well, $446 million for the year, up 6% versus 2008, and working capital reached 7.9 turns, another record. And that’s due to the ongoing success of the Stanley fulfillment system that Jim Loree is going to talk to you a little bit more about in his part of the presentation. Looking very briefly at some of the segment highlights, Security achieved 20% operating margin while absorbing a 4% revenue decline. The CDIY segment profit improved $17 million or 71% while the Industrial profit rate improved sequentially to 11.3%, and Don Allen is going to give you more detail on the segments in his portion. Last, but certainly not least, the planning for the pending combination of Black & Decker remains on track. Close is expected at the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter and I’m going to spend a few minutes updating everyone on that which may help or even preempt some of the questions, and everybody will be on the same page. Two slides on the transaction; the first one is just a bit of a refresher and the second one, think of it as an update. The benefits of this combination are compelling to say the least. The strategic benefits which we’ve talked about before will make us a global leader in both hand and power tools with an iconic brand portfolio and over 250 years of combined history. We’ll have greater scale in both hand and power tools as well as storage, mechanical security and engineered fastenings, a world class innovation process, global, low cost sourcing and manufacturing platforms and additional presence in high growth emerging markets. Both companies are growing rapidly from a low base in India, China and the rest of Asia and Black & Decker as many of you know brings a very strong presence in Latin America to the combination. The financial benefits we believe are equally compelling. It will be highly accretive with $1.00 per share of accretion projected by year three, $350 million in cost synergies on an annual basis with the opportunity for margin improvement both from the cost synergies as well as embedding SFS across a larger volume base. Free cash flow is anticipated to be in excess of $1 billion and with $1.5 billion in EBITDA by the third year of the transaction. And of course, with that cash flow we’ll have increased resources to invest in security solutions, engineered fastening, other high growth platforms as well as organic growth at the core businesses, and as we’ve stated before, our capital allocation going forward is planned to be similar to what it’s been in the past; roughly two-thirds of our cash flow focused on strategic, accretive acquisitions and one-third being returned to the shareholders in the form of both dividends and selected stock repurchases. A strong balance sheet is also important. We’re going to have a strong balance sheet going in and it’s going to be strengthened further over time. In terms of an update on the transaction, what have we done to date and what do have left to be done. As you know, we have received HSR approval. The period expired on December 29, and we’ve established January 12, 2010 as the record date for shareholders to be involved in voting for the transaction. We filed a preliminary S-4 with the SEC for review and we’re awaiting comments on the second version of that document. We’ve announced an integration team with co-leaders from both Stanley and Black & Decker; I’ll touch more on that in a minute, along with a new organization design and a senior leadership team for the combined company. And let me say what I can about that now because we’ve certainly had a lot of questions and we want to be sure everybody’s on the same page and has the same information. The senior corporate structure going forward was in fact identified in the press release. Jim Loree, Don Allen and myself will essentially have the same positions in the new company going forward as we have at Stanley. We have established a synergy steering committee that Nolan Archibald with co-share and [Jim Don] along with Mark Matthew, our head of Human Resources in [Mosel Agrasse], head of our European business and our global industrial and automotive platform will sit on that synergy team. As I mentioned, we’ve established integration management office that’s co-chaired by Brett Bontreger, a tested and proven Stanley executive who was involved in integrating Facom among other things, and most of our major acquisitions, along with Tony Milando from Black & Decker, who is currently Vice President of Operations for the worldwide power tools and accessories business. Under Brett and Tony there are fourteen dedicated teams focused on various businesses and functions with one member from Black & Decker and one member from Stanley on each of those teams and importantly, no business leaders are on those teams, and the business leaders will be charged with focusing on the core business and continuing to do what they do best, and the integration teams will collaborate closely with them to ensure that we achieve the synergies. Looking quickly at the segments, going forward our intent is to report externally in the same three segments that Stanley currently reports. In Security, the Convergent Security Solutions business will essentially remain intact while the Black & Decker Hardware and Home Improvement business will be integrated within the Mechanical Access Security business. On the Industrial segment, that essentially will remain intact as well with the global platform leaders in Industrial and Automotive repair and infrastructure reporting to Jim Loree as they do now. The Black & Decker Engineered Solutions business, probably better known as MHAR will also remain intact with Mike Tyll who currently heads that business for Black & Decker managing that business and the Stanley Assembly Technologies business will be integrated within MHAR. And finally, the Black & Decker worldwide Power Tools and Accessories business along with the Stanley Construction and Do-It-Yourself business will become the new CDIY segment. It will be under the leadership of Stanley executives and six of the top ten executives in that organization will at this stage, are planned to come from Black & Decker.  That will ensure the knowledge; the skill sets that are unique to power tools as well as the knowledge that exists within the business will carry forward in the new organization. Collaboration to the extent that we’ve been allowed to do so has been quite encouraging so far. And lastly, on the geographies looking at Europe, Asia and Latin America, existing leaders will focus on either the core business or growth opportunities depending on the geography and there’s a somewhat equal distribution at this stage of Stanley and Black & Decker executives. That’s all that I’m really able to say about the organization at this stage, but the structure as announced, is consistent with the dual objectives of protecting the core franchise while integrating the two companies as rapidly and as prudent as we can as we convey to achieve the potential synergies that are available from this transformational opportunity. Jumping back quickly to the slide, what’s left to be done; we need to continue to execute on our 2010 goals, and of course we need to obtain the remaining regulatory approvals from the EU as well as other foreign jurisdictions. We need a shareholder vote. We need approval from both the Stanley and Black & Decker shareholders and of course we need to retain key talent on both sides of the organization. That all leads as I mentioned to expected close somewhere near the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter. Solid progress we think we have achieved on all fronts. Integration planning is well underway and hopefully that answers a lot of questions that you might have had and we can focus on some other things the rest of this call. So let’s get back to Stanley’s fourth quarter. Looking at revenues around the world, they declined in most of the world as you’ll see in the U.S. on the left hand side, second from the top, revenues down 14% both as reported and organically excluding any effects of currency and in Europe, down 9%, down 16% excluding currency and acquisitions.  Asia and Australia did show some growth and it’s a complicated chart with a lot of numbers on it but we’re trying to provide you as much data as possible and hopefully the message is clear. Revenues remain down but the rate of decline was lower and revenues actually increased on a sequential basis as shown on the next slide. Looking at fourth quarter revenue by segment, again a lot of data on this chart but what I really wanted to point out is some of the trends by segment to supplement what we just showed you by geography. Volume and sources of growth is identical to what we listed in our press release in terms of the do to or the walk, but if we focus on the fourth quarter, you see volume down 16% for the entire company offset by price, was 1% favorable so organic growth declined 15%. Currency helped 4%. There was no impact from acquisitions in the fourth quarter as previous acquisitions anniversaried by the end of the third quarter so total revenues down 11%. That is all in our press release. Looking at the segment results, just a couple of things to focus on; CDIY down 8% in total, 14% volume decline which was the 8% revenue decline was obviously a significant improvement on a sequential basis. Security held up fairly well, volume down 9%, revenue down 4%. So the total company as you see got 11% in revenue, volume down 16%. Moving on to earnings, at a high level you see the 11% volume decline, but still translating to $0.89 of earnings which is 39% improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Within the fourth quarter of 2008 as stated in our press release, there were $0.59 of restructuring costs taking GAAP earnings to $0.05 a share. This year, per our press release, $0.89 of operating earnings, $0.22 of charges related to the Black & Decker transaction costs, resulting in GAAP earnings of $0.67. Looking at margins, a nice improvement of 210 basis points. Both Jim and Don are going to talk about how that worked by segment as well as what’s driving that margin improvement and looking at the tax rate of minus 4.4%, you see a little bit of an explanation in the box. It’s the effect of resolution of some income tax audits. The tax rate would have been 22% excluding this $14 million benefit. And again, as referenced in the press release, $11 million of that $14 million benefit was due to the closing of U.S. audits through 2006. The other $3 million was a favorable adjustment in the U.K. around the deductibility of certain interest payments. As you know, we’re not allowed to based on recent FAS rule changes to release any of those reserves until the audits are formally closed. The audits closed in the fourth quarter. We released the reserves, and that’s the impact as it related to EPS. Let’s turn it over to Jim who’s going to talk to you about some very encouraging margin performance driven by a combination of cost control, targeted investments and most importantly, the benefits of the Stanley fulfillment system.
Jim Loree: Thanks John. As you indicated one highlight for 2009 was the extraordinary in the area of gross margin. We achieved 40.4% for the year, a record with a 40.7% rate in the fourth quarter. For the full year that’s a 260 basis point increase over prior year, and this was achieved with the backdrop being the worst economic conditions in 60 years. And the 2009 performance, as well as the long term positive trend is really a function of four factors. One is the tight operational management across our businesses as it related to productivity projects, supplier management, price realization, product mix and new product vitality. Secondly, it’s the strength of our value propositions for our customers, able to get paid for those. And we also are benefiting quite extensively from the implementation of the Stanley fulfillment system which I’ll talk about more in a moment and then finally the deliberate shifting of our portfolio in higher margin, higher growth area. And now as we look forward, the challenge will be as we merge with Black & Decker and their gross margins in the low 30’s so on a weighted basis when we put the companies together, we’ll be right around 35% or so, and we need to begin this march forward over the coming years to get the combined company back up to these levels over time. And that will be an exciting challenge that we’ll take on with the integration process. Now moving to working capital, I have to say our fourth quarter working capital performance was a very pleasant and positive surprise. Coming into the end of the year, we were confident that we had plans in place to achieve mid to upper six turns for the year and we basically blew that number away with a volume performance which was essentially in line with what we were expecting, and we achieved 7.9 turns, a feat which I think will put us in good stead with best in class as it relates to our peers. It was a two turn increase and up almost three turns versus Q3 sequentially and was a major driver behind our $446 million of free cash flow which was our second best ever free cash flow performance, again in this very tough economy. As you can see, inventory dropped 15 days. Receivables dropped 11 days. We were able to hold payables, so a nice performance across the elements and in total, a very significant $243 million decrease in working capital. Moving to the how, it’s all about the sustained process improvement through the Stanley fulfillment system. And with Black & Decker as we integrate, we see an opportunity here as well in the coming years. They’ve been making good progress in working capital as well, but not as dramatic and not as quick, and I think we can assist them with that and really unlock several $100 million worth of cash flow. Here’s a little more information and color on SFS. As I mentioned before, it has four elements. Let’s start in the upper right hand side with the S&OP process. That’s all about keeping supply and demand in balance.  Then we move to common platforms in the lower right. That is basically standardization of process and IT platforms to provide scalability and efficiency. Now this is an area where conversely, Black & Decker can help us because they’ve made excellent progress in this area in their worldwide power tools and accessories business which is about 70% of their company and depending combination will actually accelerate Stanley’s standalone ability to drive towards common platforms. We’re very excited about that. Then we move to the lower left hand part of the slide and we talk about transformational lean. Stanley’s trademark transformational lean methodology combines traditional supply chain and manufacturing lean with back room and then combines what I call incremental lean which is what most people do with respect to lean, with an even more powerful application of lean to gain changing transformation of business models in order to create competitive advantage. In this area it’s early days for us. We have some really interesting experiments going on and implementing here. We’ve made good progress on the incremental part. Now we move to the business model transformation part and we see tremendous opportunity here in the coming years. Then finally, complexity management in the upper left, it’s all about eradicating complexity in everything we do except where customers gain value from complexity in what we offer, and then it’s about providing it most efficiently and then getting paid for it. Those are the four elements of the Stanley fulfillment system. They work in concert. They’ve been working well. It’s early days as we look at the implementation of the system and we’re very proud of the accomplishments so far but there’s many, many more to come in this area. My final slide today is about the brand. There are several key messages here. Number one, the spending is up. If we look at the spending it’s not on the chart, but if we look at it over the ’05 to ’09 time frame, we were averaging about $21 million a year of spend. That’s in stark contrast to the ’01 to ’03 time frame when we were investing $10 million a year. What we achieved from ’05 to ’09 in terms of unaided awareness improvements and frankly improvements across the spectrum of various measurements of types of awareness. In 2005 we had a 27% unaided awareness number and that went to 35% in ’06 and 41% in ’07, 43% in ’08 and finally 48%, a big increase this year, and we’re currently approaching the level that Stanley had at its peak historical level achieved in the early 80’s of 55%. So lots of good progress in the last five years, and one of the other themes is that we’re trying to spend our money much more wisely and get the biggest bang for our buck so very little TV advertising, and then spreading it around several different areas. The latest initiative that we have is we have become the official tool provider of the Walt Disney World Resort and we have a partnership with Disney which is a 10 year alliance. It brings branding in the parks, B to B opportunities and other elements with a select group of alliance partners. We have construction wall signage throughout the Walt Disney Resort. Stanley, Mac and Vidmar products are highlighted in the Lights Motor Action garage. We’re also providing cabinets, tools, branded benches, cabinets and tools and accessories for the test track line area and the ride itself. So that’s very exciting and just getting underway.  Of course we continue to be a Nascar sponsor. We have sustained brand exposure over 38 weekends with primary sponsorship in 20 races, extensive customer and user activation and numerous race related in store and on track promotions, and a very healthy menu for 2010. Last year’s big story for the brand awareness moving the needle was the Major League Baseball sponsorship. In 2009 we had 11 teams. We’re going to add one in 2010, thus giving us signage in 40% of all the games and we have really placed our signs strategically to maximize television exposure and we love and thank our Hartford neighbors at ESPN folks for their sports center coverage of our brand and its saturation that we get from all that exposure. And then of course last year we also began sponsoring the English Premier League which is the number one soccer league in the world and 650 million people around the world watch that every week and it’s an exciting initiative. Now I’ll turn it over to Don Allen who will take you through some of the numbers.
Donald Allen: Thanks Jim. The next page is walk of the SG&A in the fourth quarter. As we typically try to show you each quarter, we take last year’s SG&A and walk it forward. I’ll start with the right side of the chart. If you look at the cost reductions that we’ve done throughout the year, just as a reminder, in total we reduced cost by $265 million in 2009. Of that number, about $150 million impacted SG&A and the head count impacted was just under 3,000 individuals. So in the fourth quarter we saw a $37 million benefit of that which is 13% reduction to the base versus the fourth quarter of ’08.  And then looking at some of the increases on the left side of the chart, we did have some integration costs associated with the planning of the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker of about $5 million.  FX was a negative impact year over year of $10 million and then we continued investments in SG&A. Jim just spent a fair amount of time talking through the brand investments and the significance of that. As many of you are aware we made investments in our Security businesses to put more feet on the street and focus on certain share gains we can achieve. And then as we began to re-instate some of our employee benefits in the fourth quarter that were suspended earlier in the year, we begin to see some cost increases there. So the net result is about a 2% decline in SG&A and we continue to see the impact of our reductions in the fourth quarter. Now I’d like to spend a little bit of time walking you through the segments. We start with the Security segment. Once again Security was the gem of the quarter. In the four quarters of 2009 we experienced in essence a single digit revenue declines but have been improving their profit rate throughout the year and year over year as well. So if we look at revenues, as John mentioned, revenues were down 4%, organically down 7% so a consistent trend that we’ve seen throughout the year. The good news is that the segment profit was actually up 4% on that small revenue decline which resulted in segment profit rate of 19.9% so just under 20% which was off of last quarter which was close to 21%, so 150 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of ’08. Looking at the two sub business within our Security segment, starting with Convergent Security Solutions first, revenues declined similar in line with the total segment, single digits. They continue to see weakness in the installation revenues and health care capital expenditures affecting some of the small health care businesses in this business. That continues to be a constraint as we move forward. The good news is their recurring monthly revenues continue to grow and we saw growth in the fourth quarter again in the low double digits range. So as we move forward looking at profit rate and revenue trends, I’ll spend more time later on, but we’ve seen a continual trend in the Convergent business of improving their profit rate performance because they’re really been focused on the integration of the acquisitions, driving the benefits and cost reduction, productivity in their cost base, and obviously the mix towards more RMR versus installation improves their profit rate as well. On the Mechanical Access side of the segment, similar story but slightly different reasons for them. Revenues declined a little bit more significantly than we saw in the Convergent side. They have been affected by the slowdown in commercial construction more than we’ve seen in Convergent.  However, they’ve been very focused on retaining and maintaining certain national customers, and that’s something we will continue to be focused on as we got through this slowdown in commercial construction. A great story for them in line with the overall working capital story for the company is that working capital turn for MAS were up 14.7% and along with that they improved their fill rates. So last but not least, their profit rate improved as well through price realization, the deflation that we saw in commodity prices and then the continued cost reductions that they’ve done throughout the year. Moving to the Industrial segment, Industrial as you know throughout the year has really suffered on the top line. They’ve seen significant inventory corrections throughout the supply chain to our end customers, and in the fourth quarter we did see significant revenue declines again, although not as significant as we saw on the previous three quarters of 2009. So revenues were down 23%, organically 26% and the segment profit was only down 14% versus that revenue decline as we did see many of the cost actions that we started in Europe in the spring of 2009 were completed in the fourth quarter so we saw the benefit of that in the segment profit, and as a result, the segment profit rate was at 11.3% which was a sequential improvement from the third quarter where it was at 9.2%. So we saw a nice impact of those cost actions coming through in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned, we did see significant destocking trends throughout the year. We believe that they have ceased in the fourth quarter in the Industrial segment and I’ll talk more about what we think that means for next year later on in the presentation. Facom’s revenue decline has slowed to 11% where we saw significant declines in the previous quarter in the mid 20% to 30% range, and they’ve been very focused on their new product development along with the Proto business and how we can actually gain share in this type of declining environment and that continues to be something that’s always been significant in the Facom business and will be going forward. The last item to mention is the Mac tools business. Mac has significantly improved their profit share over the year and that was despite an 18% drop in their unit volume as they were very focused on price realization and actions with the end customers and cost reductions. CDIY had a nice quarter as well in the fourth quarter as we continue to see and experience further stabilization in this segment. The revenues were down 8% as John mentioned. Organically they were down 13%, and so in the first three quarters revenues were down 25%, 28% and 23%, and now only down 8%. Part of that is certainly the comps we’re comparing to in the fourth quarter of ’08, but it’s also an improvement on a sequential basis, so we are seeing nice stabilization and the potential for some growth as we move forward. Segment profit up 71%, really being driven by the integration of the Bostitch business in the consumer tools and storage throughout the year, significant productivity within the plants, some of them associated with Bostitch but also just the normal productivity programs that we implement and then certainly SG&A actions that they’ve taken have assisted in getting to almost a 12% segment profit rate in the fourth quarter. The last think I’ll mention here on CDIY is that the working capital turn has improved to 7.9 turns. That almost a two turn improvement versus the prior year. So clearly, SFS has really taken hold on our CDIY segment. On the next chart I’d like to spend a little bit of time talking about some of the key trends as we move forward. If we start with Security, the way this chart works, we showed it for the first time for you last quarter, is up top, the yellow line represents the segment profit rate over the previous two years, and then the gray bars represent the unit volume decline within revenue. In Security, as I mentioned earlier, installations within our Convergent business are showing some signs of slight improvement in Europe but they continue to be very weak within the U.S. and that will be something we continue to monitor as we go into 2010. Commercial construction continues the slowdown. The slowdown in commercial construction continues to impact both businesses, but even more in our Mechanical Access business. So we’re beginning to focus on other areas such as education and health care verticals to try to offset the impact of that as we move forward. We would expect that any slowdown or recovery in commercial construction market would probably lag a recovery in the residential construction market, so it appears that residential construction has stabilized, and we’ll see as we move forward what the time frame for both those recoveries are. Last but not least, we believe our profit rate will likely continue to very strong in our segment as we continue to focused on price inflation management as well as effective cost management, and trying to gain share in all different areas as much as possible. Industrial clearly is lagging behind both businesses and lagging behind CDIY. We do believe that the vast majority of the inventory destocking we saw is behind us. Industrial production worldwide continues to be up so we do believe that will ultimately have a positive impact on our business moving forward but we are cautious as we move into 2010. We believe the destocking is behind us as I mentioned and there is a suggestion of a possibility of improvement as certain restocking may need to take place in this segment because of the low inventory levels throughout the supply chain. But we’ll be focused on top line weakness and really trying to maintain our profit rates as we experienced in late 2009 and ensure that our cost base is appropriately adjusted and maintained to where it is today. The profit rate has probably bottomed out in the third quarter in the low 9% range. We think that it will likely continue moving forward at a trend that we saw in the fourth quarter. CDIY clearly has stabilized as I mentioned and as many of you know this segment is impacted by housing starts and consumer confidence, and so we believe there will be modest growth in this segment in 2010. We do think the growth in the U.S. will be muted and emerging markets will be much stronger, but it’s something that we’ll keep a close eye on to see if there is a stronger recovery as we move into 2010. Again, being very focused on new product development, innovation, our marketing to be a key driver to our top line, gain as much market share as we can in this difficult environment. And then profit rates continue the migration back to historical levels in 2010. So that’s the segments. Let’s spend a little bit of time on free cash flow which is the next page. Jim touched on the significant working capital performance of 7.9 turns which resulted in over $200 million of working capital positive cash flow in the fourth quarter and for the year, $226 million. The net result of our earnings and our working capital turn performance offset by our planned capital expenditures was $263 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter which is up significantly over $100 million versus last year’s fourth quarter mostly due to the working capital performance. And then for the year, our free cash flow was $446 million, up almost $25 million versus last year or 6% which is a significant performance considering the revenue pressures that we saw throughout 2009. Next, our balance sheet; as many of you are aware we had a plan to deleverage ourselves in 2009 by $200 million. We slightly over achieved that where our debt went down $229 million and our adjusted debt to capital is right around 30% which is exactly what we were targeting for the year. So we’re very pleased with that. Obviously the cash flow that we experienced and the significant working capital, turn improvement really facilitated us achieving that goal. So let’s move to guidance. The first thing I want to note is that the guidance we’re providing excludes any impacts of the Black & Decker and Stanley merger so this would be Stanley standalone for 2010. We believe that the EPS will range from $3.00 to $3.25 on a standalone basis and there’s certain assumptions that we’ve put in place that align with that particular net result. Net revenues should increased 2% to 4%. That’s primarily unit volume revenue increases. We believe it reflects a modest economic recovery. Each one of our segments will be impacted differently as I just described, but we think it’s a reasonable modest recovery. There are a couple of non recurring items in 2009 that you need to factor in as you look at our 2009 EPS and try to roll forward to this guidance, the first of which is a $0.34 gain on debt extinguishment that we did in the second quarter where we were actually able to repurchase over $100 million of our junior subordinated debt securities for about $55 million for a $44 million gain. John mentioned the Black & Decker transactional cost in the fourth quarter of $0.22. And then the next item would be a reminder to folks that we will have a diluted impact of some shares that we need to issue around May of 2010. It will be about $0.16 EPS dilution and it’s associated with our equity unit hybrid instrument. The proceeds from that will be used to pay down other debt maturities that obviously mature at certain points throughout 2010. The tax rate we expect to turn back to more normalized levels. That’s a diluted impact of about $0.20 to $0.25 year over year. And then the next items which is certainly significant, as we’ve mentioned during the year, we expect about $100 million of cost carry over from 2009 to 2010. We have $75 million here as we have reinstated certain employee benefit costs as well as certain other costs that we are allowing to go back into the system so it nets to $75 million carry over. And we have certain investments we want to make, continue to make in brand and security as we move forward and those investments will certainly be monitored as we move throughout the year and ensure that our top line actually performs in the 2% to 4% range. Restructuring and impairment related charges should be flat to 2009. They were $45 million in 2009. We had $41 million in the restructuring line and about $4 million in the OM lines up above, so we expect that to be relatively flat as we will continue certain plan rationalization activities in line with our SFS. And then we expect a net zero impact from price and inflation. We currently have very little inflation in our estimates as they’re based on current commodity prices and if commodity prices increase and we experience inflation, we would expect that we would be able to pass that onto our customers in a price increase. Free cash flow estimate is about $300 million to $350 million. We’re estimating a relatively modest improvement in working capital for Stanley as we will be investing a lot of time in the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker and also trying to implement a lot of the SFS principals within the new company. And last thing I’ll mention here is that we still are committed to the financial guidance provided with respect to the new combined company of Stanley and Black & Decker as we rolled out in November of last year. So in summary, we continue to move forward on a rigorous integration planning for Black & Decker. It’s something that a lot of us are investing a great deal of time in at this point. We’re very much focused though on making sure that our core businesses continue to perform strongly and we’re focused on market share gains, customer services and keeping our fill rates up and improving them. We do see modest signs of growth potential within CDIY and that’s encouraging, but we are being cautious as we move forward here to make sure that if a market recovery happens, we’re ready and prepared to handle it, but if it doesn’t we have contingency plans in place to accordingly. SFS is going to play an integral role in really navigating any significant upswing in demand that we experience as well as the successful integration of Black & Decker. We believe we’re ready to serve our customers in the event of any volume surge that might occur throughout the year. That concludes our presentation.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Eric Bosshard – Cleveland Research.
Eric Bosshard – Cleveland Research: Can you talk about the source of the 2% to 4% revenue growth? You seem optimistic about some progress in CDIY and a little bit more conservative in the other two segments. I’m just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the why the 2% to 4% revenue expectation and where you expect that to come from? Secondly, I’m interested in your thoughts on free cash flow especially in light of the six million additional shares coming out in 2010 and if there is any consideration to buy back stock to offset that.
Donald Allen: 2% to 4% we think is modest as I mentioned. If you look at our three different segments, we do think CDIY will likely have some nice growth during 2010. Industrial has the potential but we’re very cautious for growth as it’s difficult to see how the supply chain is going to react to their customers in that segment. And in Security, we think relatively modest growth. There will be pressure associated with the commercial construction slowdown and how long that lags on. We think the vast majority of 2010 commercial construction will be relatively slow. I think obviously our history as a company around share repurchases, we evaluate those on a case by case basis. We will have a fair amount of need for cash associated with the Black & Decker Stanley merger. There’s a lot of one time costs, restructuring and other payments that will need to be made. There is about $670 million of one time costs. Of that, about $470 million is cash so there will be significant cash obligations in connection with that. But we’ll have to see as the two companies come together what the projections we have for cash flow are in the first two to three quarters.
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Lisnic – Robert W. Baird.
Peter Lisnic – Robert W. Baird: First question, on the 40% gross margin this year, and that’s in the context of volume down 20%, how should we think about that going forward if we get basically volume under absorption dissipates as you progress with better comparisons going forward? And then on the strong free cash flow in the fourth quarter, does that have any implications for what you might be able to extract out of BDK and that $1 million target that you said?
Jim Loree: As far as the second question, I’ll start with that one. We have no idea what their cash flow looks like in the fourth quarter or what it might look like prospectively until we have a much deeper integration process and we close the deal. So it’s really a difficult question to answer without the requisite information. As far as the gross margin rate goes, we’re pleased with the 40% and excited about the progress. We don’t see anything that suggests that on a standalone basis the gross margin rate would go down any time soon in the company and obviously there will be all sorts of things that we’ll have to deal with along the way such as the CDIY business grows at a faster rate than the Security business. That’s going to put a little downward pressure on it. We’re pretty confident that we’ll continue to see progress in productivity including the effect of absorption benefits that should accrue as volume begins to come back in general. So we those two as more or less offsetting and then we’ll continue to work all the levers that I mentioned when I went through the gross margin chart, the price inflation recovery. If you go back to 2004, we’re still almost $90 million short in terms of the recovery of inflation through pricing. So we’re not building any kind of a price umbrella at all, and we’re not over extended in that area. However, you never know what competitive conditions are and how they’re going to evolve. So we’ll continue to manage that with our pricing center of excellence and all the folks that we have out in the business coordinating very carefully on that one. Then we have our productivity, our mix management, our new product innovation and as I said earlier, getting paid for the value proposition. So we’d like to see that 40% carry on. We think we can do it and I guess time will tell.
John Lundgren: Just to supplement what Jim said, with 39.9% in the second quarter and then third and fourth quarter both above 40% in the face of the volume decline that we cited, I think demonstrates we strongly believe demonstrates that we have right sized our company to make money and to achieve a 40% gross margin in a volume environment that’s 15% to 20% below our highs in 2007 and 2008. That being said, obviously we’ll get tremendous leverage from any upside volume improvement some of which will be reinvested in growth initiatives because we were really encouraged with the results of those modest investments that we experienced during 2009.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Sam Sargach – Raymond James]
[Sam Sargach – Raymond James]: You have taken great pains to itemize all of the cost savings opportunities with the transaction and obviously it’s a key focus of the organization. Talk about what you’re dong to maintain and possibly grow market share of the combined company beyond just the verticals of Black & Decker is strong in Latin America and Stanley is strong in the automotive. Oftentimes when you have these combinations, you have cuts in sales and marketing and R&D departments and it tends to hurt market share a little bit. The second question would be what the interest expense expectation of the organic business would be in 2010?
John Lundgren: The answer to the first one is simple. Talk to us again in April or May when the deal is closed. Your question is a very fair one. It’s one that I wish we had a better answer to. It’s one where I wish we could collaborate more closely with Black & Decker because getting to know the people and the capabilities that exist within that organization has been extraordinarily encouraging. That being said, we’re not legally able to coordinate, collaborate to the extent required, quite frankly the answer to your answer. We can do a lot of things, but we can’t collaborate on markets. We can’t collaborate on strategy, even product development, anything that’s forward looking, and you’ll understand the legal constraints for that. While we don’t essentially compete in the marketplace, the products are complimentary, we are in the same marketplace so we essentially have to think about what we’re going to do independently until the deal closes, and then we’ll get the collective best heads from both companies together and we’ll have a much better answer to your question than we’re able to provide now.
Jim Loree: Let me just further say is what we can answer is on the standalone basis what we’re doing, and just very quickly, in the CDIY business, the name of the game has and will continue to product innovation and we’ve just sat through several days a few weeks ago right before the end of the year of an update on what they were doing, what they’ve got planned for this year, and it’s really exciting. It continues to be a new product machine let by Jeff Hansel and his team. And then in the Industrial business, they’ve done a lot of work in harnessing the power of the combined platform. So whereas in the past we used to go to market as Mac and Facom and Vidmar separately, effective January 1, we put that all in one business leader with a functionalized organization as well as a regionalized organization where they’re sharing new product development. They’re sharing global strategy development and market development. So I think you’re going to see a real power house initiative in terms of market share emerge from them, and then of course in Security we have new products in Mechanical.  We have the YQ product in particular in both Electronic and Mechanical. We have the addition of feet on the street which Don mentioned is a significant investment in Security, and all of those I think are geared along with our significant increase this year in brand investment to continue to push the needle in that area, all in there interest of market share gain.
Donald Allen: As you know, interest expense is about $61 million in2009. We would expect it probably to be somewhere between $52 million and $54 million in 2010.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Jeff Kessler – Ontario Capital]
[Jeff Kessler – Ontario Capital]: With the increase that you’ve shown in margins relative to sales in particularly in the Convergent side of Security, I’m wondering what are you doing to increase your RMR component both in the quality of the RMR as well as the absolute amount of recurring revenue that you’re getting from that division?
John Lundgren: You almost answered the question in that it’s the quality of the RMR and increased percentage of RMR that is driving the margin improvement within Security. It’s a bit of a double edged sword. As our business mix improves, as we fully integrate HSM and GTP, we’re getting a much higher MRM component. That in and of itself, those very solid companies that [Rick Von Trager] and the team have done a very, very job bringing on board. That’s helping a lot. The double edged sword is as commercial construction is down, regrettably install as a percent of the total revenue was also down. So that’s driving a mix based margin improvement which has been very favorable the last couple of quarters. Importantly, you understand this business well; we need to pick up on the installations. They’ll be profitable installations, but they’ll be less profitable than the RMR element in order to fuel our fund that future RMR. So we’re at a bit of a crossroads. We’re at a really good position where we are in terms of mix and now with a little help from the marketplace and aggressive share gain program on the installations, we’ll drive some installations to make sure the RMR pipeline stays full.
[Jeff Kessler – Ontario Capital]: And as a follow up to that, you’ve made an announcement you’ve settled the law suit with the franchisee group that was suing you. Is that issue effectively put to bed and will the cost effect along with that be put to bed?
John Lundgren: The issue is put to bed. The cost I’ll go so far as to say diminutive and we’re going to move forward. A lot of noise. You follow this industry very closely. A lot of noise and a lot of sizzle but not a lot of steak. Consider it behind us. 
Jim Loree: I would also say that we had a very, very satisfactory session with them shortly after the beginning of the year and I think we’ve turned to corner now in terms of how the franchisees view us and we view them. It’s a much more positive win win approach and now the proof will be in the execution but the spirit is there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kenneth Zener – Macquarie.
Kenneth Zener – Macquarie: I wanted to ask a broad question then ask about CDIY. But first, your 2010 sales guidance of 2% to 4%, I’m wondering just conceptually how you can, or any comments you have relative to the 2% flat line growth you’ve given for the merged companies in your 1, 2, and 3.
Donald Allen: Basically if you look at the Stanley projections that are in our S-4 it was about just under 2% growth for 2010. That was in there. I can’t speak to the Black & Decker projections going forward whether there are any revisions associated with that.  But on the Stanley side, just under 2%. Now we’re thinking a range of 2% to 4% and it’s really I think an indication of some of the trends that I mentioned around CDIY and in particular that makes us feel a little bit better about that.
Kenneth Zener – Macquarie: It does seem rather low. On CDIY which did obviously good margins year over year but I think in the quarter sequentially it was perhaps a little bit low. I wonder if you can talk about the margin puts and takes there given that revenue actually in 4Q was actually than 3Q so I would have thought your absorption was there. If you could just go into some of those details; I think that was one item that might have caught people’s eye in the quarter.
Donald Allen: Historically if you look at the CDIY business, although they’ve experienced significant under absorption during 2009 even in the later stages of 2008, in the fourth quarter we do historically have significant shut downs above and beyond just normal volume trends. So we tend to see somewhat of a dip in the segment profit rate in the fourth quarter from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. That’s the main driver of that.
John Lundgren: Don’s referring to the fact that you understand as well, home centers are a large source of revenue for CDIY. As you know the home centers close their books at the end of January and as a consequence, orders and shipments are very light in late December and early January. Historically there are always several hundred basis point decline all other things being equal in margins in that segment third to fourth quarter which is why we don’t spend a lot of time tracking sequential margins by segment and talking to it externally unless there was an unanticipated event. To come back to the whole year, the biggest driver in the CDIY margin improvement which we’ve talked about a little and maybe not enough is the tremendous success of the integration of Bostitch within the consumer tools storage business to form the new CDIY platform. Bostitch which is was a struggling business and facing unprecedented volume declines, many of which were market driven has dramatically improved its margins within CDIY despite the fact that its 20% to 25% less volume. So that’s a huge driver within that segment, but the sequential decline was no surprise at all to us. Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut – J.P. Morgan.
Michael Rehaut – J.P. Morgan: I wanted to get a little more color on your outlook for next year. Obviously we’re just at the beginning of the year but as it more relates to the Security segment where you said that you gave some general comments on each segment but with Security said perhaps modest growth because of the commercial construction slowdown, and I was wondering if you could first, remind us of the breakdown in terms of your exposure to commercial construction by CSS and MAS and it appears that despite that, you’re still looking for overall perhaps a little bit of modest growth in the segment, so how do you get there? And number two, just more broadly if you could remind us how you think about the end markets and the longer term growth outlook perhaps over the next five years as it relates to the comments that you’ve made in the past about the way those markets grow and your positioning within those markets.
John Lundgren: I’ll try to summarize the questions for Don. What is our exposure to commercial construction in our Security business and what’s our view on some of the end markets as it relates to our projection of 2% to 4% revenue growth in 2010?
Donald Allen: Just as a refresher, there is actually a nice end market chart that I believe is in the appendix of the presentation, but Kate White can get it to anyone who’s looking for it. Commercial construction for total Stanley is 11% of our revenues. You look at the Mechanical Access and Convergent businesses, for Mechanical it’s about 12% and then for Convergent it’s about 17%. So it’s not a huge portion of the business but it’s certainly significant and it’s something that can have a bit of a negative impact on us and we would expect a little bit of a negative impact in 2010 from that. But there are other sectors as I mentioned such as health care, education, and government that are significant in both the Security businesses. In the case of Convergent, health care is almost 23% and then government and education combined is about 14% in Convergent and about the same number in Mechanical. So there’s some nice verticals in both businesses that have not been as dramatically impacted by the slowing economy nor do we think they’re going to be significantly impacted as we go into 2010. So you have a dynamic that’s happening in our Security segment where they will have a negative drag around commercial construction, but we do think there’s some verticals that can offset that and result in slightly modest growth for the year.
Michael Rehaut – J.P. Morgan: And then in terms of longer term how you think about Security and the different end markets in the annual growth potential?
Donald Allen: We’ve always said long term that we believe that the Security businesses will grow anywhere from 3% to 6%. It really depends on which component of the business. The Convergent business or the Electronic piece would grow at the higher end of that range and Mechanical at the lower end of the range. Who knows exactly when these economic circumstances get back to normal, but over the long term that’s what our expectation would be.
John Lundgren: One benefit of what Don said is historically we were always in a position to say we’re making a trade off. When Convergent was growing faster but margins were lower, so we were balancing growth and margin within our Security platform. Steve has done a really nice job as evidenced by Jeff Kessler’s question, basically getting the Convergent margins up to or even above a level of Mechanical, and while we don’t spend a lot of time focusing on margins by segment, right now we’re quite encouraged because we have a high growth high margin in the Convergent security business as well as a very, very profitable but more modest growth on the Mechanical Security business.
Operator: This concludes the allotted time for today’s questions. I turn the call back over to Kate White.
Kate White: I want to thank you all for spending time this morning to discuss our 4Q and full year 2009 results with us. As always, I’m here to help with any questions you may have. All my contact information is on the website. Please feel free to reach out to me if you need anything further. Thank you.

Operator:  Good morning. My name is Sarah and I’ll be the conference operator today. At this time I’d like to welcome everyone to The Stanley Works third quarter 2009 results conference call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I’d now like to turn the call over to Kate White, Director of Investor Relations. Miss White you may begin your conference. 
Kate White:  Thank you so much, Sarah. Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us on The Stanley Works third quarter 2009 conference call.  On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, Stanley’s Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, Stanley’s Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Stanley’s Vice President and CFO. I would like to point out that our third quarter earnings release, which was issued this morning, and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to you on the call and are on the webcast are available on the brand new Investor Relations portion of our website, www.stanleyworks.com.  This morning John, Jim and Don will review Stanley’s third quarter 2009 results and various other topics followed by a Q&A session. The entire call is expected to last approximately one hour and a replay of the call will be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. And as always, please feel free to contact me with any follow up questions after today’s call at my number which is 860-827-3833.  We will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. And we direct you to the cautionary statements in our 8-K which we filed with today’s press release and our most recent 34-A. With that I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren:  Thanks Kate and thanks for all of you on the phone for joining us this morning. Let me spend just a minute on the state of Stanley in terms of an overview.  First of all, we reported third quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.77 a share. Regrettably in reporting our results one or two of the news agencies dropped this number, which was actually in the headline of the press release we issued this morning, so some of you may have had to search the text and our exhibits a little bit more than we intended. But it’s $0.77 EPS, very clear and straightforward which compares to $0.97 a year ago from continuing operations, 3Q ’08. And on a GAAP basis the $2.04 that we recorded last year included $1.07 gain on the sale of our CST laser measuring business. So hopefully all that’s clear and we can move forward from there. We are still experiencing mid-teens volume and revenue declines versus a year ago, but we were encouraged by modest sequential revenue growth in the third quarter given the lack of seasonality in our business. We were even more encouraged by margins, a record quarterly gross margin of 41.3% which was achieved due to good pricing discipline as well as some meaningful cost productivity initiatives. Commodity deflation which we are experiencing was essentially offset by the impact of the volume under absorption. So those in a sense offset one another on an equal basis. Cash flow was also encouraging, $158 million for the quarter. That was up $55 million versus the same period year ago as we continued to execute our Stanley Fulfillment System and that process and program gains traction. And as a consequence we’re able to raise our cash flow guidance for the year, and we now expect to exceed $300 million in cash flow. Security segment achieved a 3% revenue growth and 13% profit growth versus prior year. And within our convergent or electronic sub-segment organic revenues increased 5% sequentially which was also encouraging given the state of the market.  CDIY did show signs of sequential demand stabilization around the world. The focus going forward particularly in the fourth quarter is going to be new product roll outs, which we tend to do twice a year in waves and normally in the second and fourth quarter to stimulate further demand.  As a consequence of third quarter results, as well as our assessment of the environment over the next two to three months, our full year EPS guidance has also increased to a range of $2.84 to $2.94. Taking a geographic look at revenues, all major regions continue to absorb double digit declines which is indicative of the weakness in global economic conditions. The U.S. which accounts for nearly 60% of our revenue was down 17% organically, 16% in total. Europe was off about 22% organically, 16% in total as acquisitions played a role there, as well as Asia and Australia down similar measures. So no particular large geography in terms of our revenue was affected [inaudible] it’s a fairly broad scale softness which I’m sure you’ve heard on many calls and Don’s going to talk a little bit more about what we’re experiencing later. In terms of our third quarter results per se, operating margins rose 40 basis points to 14.4%. You can see the EPS of $0.97 that I referred to a year ago versus $0.77 this year. Tax rate was favorable by 240 basis points, 22.2%. And we were a little bit affected by share count being up marginally, up 800,000 shares to 80.6 million. So pretty straightforward in terms of EPS. Reasonably a strong performance despite the continued volume headwinds which is obviously having an impact. Looking at revenues for the third quarter as mentioned they did improve sequentially to $936 million from $919 million in the previous quarter, but importantly we’re down 16% versus the same period year ago. Looking at the left of the chart in terms of sources of growth, as mentioned volumes down 20%. We got some help from price with continued discipline of 2% favorable so that’s the organic 18% revenue decline to which we referred. Currency was negative but less so than in previous quarters, as you can see the trend as the dollar strength changes relative to foreign currencies. And acquisitions was positive, but that was also less help than in previous quarters. It added 4% to our total revenue base versus 7% and 6% in prior quarters. So in total revenues down 16% versus the same period year ago. Looking at the segments, I won’t spend too much time on revenue because Jim is going to take a much deeper dive into that a little later on in the presentation but it’s clear from the segment chart that our Industrial businesses around the world are under the most pressure in terms of revenue. CDIY is still experiencing external headwinds but certainly it appears to be abating to some extent. And Security’s holding up pretty well under the circumstances and obviously contributing to some of the stability that we’re experiencing. Moving on to volume trends, they are stabilizing to some extent and that’s due in part as to simply the mathematics of weaker comps that are present beginning 2Q ’09 which was essentially the beginning of the downturn. The chart I think is fairly straightforward where you see our third quarter unit volume down 20% and revenues down 16% which I suggested. And those comps will be a little easier or a little more favorable in the fourth quarter as we look to close out the year. We were encouraged by our working capital performance. Despite a 16% revenue decline, our turns improved 8% as previously mentioned as the Stanley Fulfillment System gains further traction.  We took three days out of inventory versus the same period year ago, nine days out of receivables. Payables were unfavorable by seven days. The negative impact is due to a combination of lower volume, less CapEx, and in some cases concession on terms as we’ve leveraged our strong balance sheet to get more favorable discounts and pricings based simply on an ability to pay our bills on time. And supplier credit is always good to have and so were large discounts when you’re able to achieve them.  So in total we’ve seen turns improve from 4.8 to 5.2% which as Don has talked on previous calls is a tremendous source of cash flow. Finally last but not least for my piece a minute on our record gross margins of 41.3% and very strong operating margin of 14.4%, which hopefully this chart indicates is not a short term phenomenon. A lot of things going on to achieve this as well as the cash flow, especially within our core businesses. It’s not happening on their own and what Jim’s going to take you through is how SFS or the Stanley Fulfillment System are driving both margins and cash flow, as well as a little more granularity on SG&A. Jim’s piece will show you that we’re building our brand while still maintaining I think very good control over discretionary spending, and then a closer look into the segments. And Don’s going to close with a look at some of the market trends that are affecting both our cash flow and our fourth quarter guidance. So let me turn it over to Jim Loree, our COO.
James M. Loree:  Okay. We’ll stay on the margin chart just for a minute here and I find this extremely encouraging considering the 16% volume decline and the 23% reduction in inventory. As John mentioned we closed out the quarter 41.3% gross margin and that’s an all-time record for the company as he did mention, and the first time in my ten years that we’ve been greater than 40% which is a big milestone.  And this was done at a time as I mentioned when the production volumes are down greater than 30% versus last year. And to expand a little bit on some of the key drivers, the strength of our value propositions has really enabled us to achieve solid price realization. And that’s offset cumulative $440 million of inflation since 2004. The Stanley Fulfillment System is a key to this and transformational lean has been driving productivity in our factories and in our supply chain for quite some time. Business mix has also helped as Security’s become a larger part of the portfolio. And of course the $370 million of cost cuts, a portion of those were in cost of goods sold and have helped enable us to deal with the steep volume declines while protecting our margins. And all this raises the obvious question is this sustainable? And there will be some headwinds going into 2010 as tools and storage mix is up and some of the cost cuts, probably about 25% or so, come back. But it’s safe to assume that we’re now operating in the neighborhood of 40% and that’s what we expect to record for the year and I would expect that you can think of the company as a 40% gross margin company on a prospective basis. I mentioned the Stanley Fulfillment System. I want to spend a little more time on that. It involves four components. Let’s start with the upper right, Sales and Operations Planning. This is simply keeping supply and demand in balance, so not making too many things when you don’t need them. When volume is down you make less. When volume is up you make more. We have a phrase we have coined, sell one, replenish one. And the idea is to try to make every day what the customers need that day. We’re not there yet, but that’s the direction we’re going in and I think we’ve done a pretty good job of keeping our inventories in check through a robust sales and operations planning process throughout the company. Now we’ll move to the lower left, Transformational Lean. This is the implementation of lean in all our factory supply chains and back offices. Now many, many companies do lean and do this every day. I think the thing that differentiates us is that we actually have trademarked our Transformational Lean phrase because what we try do is to instead of just incrementalizing improvements we try to step back and say how can we change the business model utilizing lean to create a sustainable competitive advantage. And done that in a few cases, not throughout the company but that’s starting to take effect. And the benefits from lean are felt every day in our productivity performance. Now moving to the lower right, Standardization of Processes and Platforms across the company to provide us with scalability. That’s another important part of the Stanley Fulfillment System.  And then finally, the toughest nut to crack but the one that we’re making some progress on now and we’ve been at it a few years is this Complexity Reduction or Complexity Management. And this is all about simplifying every aspect of the business to drive profitability and asset efficiency. You can see that manifested in the results. Now move on to SG&A. The SG&A expenses are down 9% versus the prior year, but that doesn’t tell the full story because when you net out the acquisitions we’re really down 14%. You can see the $16 million increase from acquisitions. We’ve also made $5 million worth of incremental investments in the third quarter, about $20 million annualized. Had a little inflation. Some benefit from foreign exchange. And then the actions totaling about $41 million have really enabled us to achieve that minus 14% performance in SG&A. And despite that reduction in SG&A, the company now is really aggressively building its brand up there globally. But let’s start with the USA. It’s playoff season. That means our major league baseball presence is at its strongest. Right now we are in three out of the four playoff teams in a very prominent way and we’re starting to see some early evidence of increased aided brand awareness in a quantitative sense. And we’ll have much more information on that as we close out the season and we’ll probably share some of that with you at our analyst meeting in November. The next and newest area is our major thrust into global brand development. And we are sponsoring the English Premier League and International World Cup qualifiers with signage at the base of the perimeter of the field, electronic signage which comes up and is seen on TV and often seems to be prominent right at the time when goals are scored or people are watching. This is seen by more than 1 billion viewers per week and interestingly 40% of the impressions are actually from outside of Europe. And you can start to, when you talk to some of the Asian folks in our company, you can start to hear the buzz about what their customers are saying about the Stanley brand and the fact that they see it on football. Moving up to the upper left we’re also moving aggressively into social media. Four months ago we had no presence on Facebook and Twitter. Today we have over 1,000 followers on Facebook and 800 or so on Twitter. And then finally I’m pleased to invite you to surf our just upgraded IR website at StanleyWorks.com. And it’s a very impressive piece of work. Now I’m going to spend some time on the segments. Well Security once again was the gem of the quarter. Revenues were up marginally, up 3%. Organic growth was down slightly, down 6%. But segment profit was up in double digits and the profit rate exceeded 20% which was very, very impressive performance. Convergent, the electronic business, revenues were up 13%, organic was down 5% but recurring monthly revenue was up 5% organically. The profit rate was up 150 basis points over the prior year and even though the declines in installations slowed, the national account installations increased. And the CapEx constraints while not completely gone are starting to loosen.  The big news in mechanical access was the profit rate as well. They did a nice job on price realization, class reduction actions, etc. But the Stanley branded hardware rollout at a major North American retailer is well underway now, will be meaningful from a revenue perspective in the fourth quarter and next year. And the early signs at the point-of-sale are very encouraging.  Moving on to Industrial, the steep revenue declines took their toll on profitability in this segment during the quarter with organic growth down a staggering 30%, not unexpected but certainly a difficult story to deal with from a profitability perspective. And our costs in Industrial tend to come out a little bit more slowly than they do in the rest of the company because this is the most concentrated segment that we have in Europe where the cost take-outs take a little longer to manifest themselves. Segment profit was down 53% to $19 million and the profit rate was right around 9%, which is where it was in the second quarter as well. We believe this is kind of a trough area of segment profit rate for industrial and we’ll talk a little bit about what we think is happening on a prospective basis in a minute. The inventory corrections continued to be a headwind. We expect them to continue perhaps at a slightly lower level into the fourth quarter. And then they should be gone by the first quarter as the Industrial buyers start buying in proportion to their production volume which is increasing now as we look at the economic statistics.  We’ve divided the segment into two sub-segments for the purposes of describing it to you. It also happens to be the way we manage it at the company, Industrial and Automotive Repair Tools which is Facom and Proto on the left hand side in the lower left. Facom was down 27% in revenue but their new product development remains strong and the Facom products are also being cross-fertilized in some of the other areas such as Proto and Mac. I mentioned the European cost reductions and the lagging effect there. On Industrial and Automotive Supply, which is Mac, Vidmar and Supply and Services, the Mac profitability was encouraging. They did have double digit revenue declines but they made good progress from a profitability perspective. I think the good news when we step back from the overall segment is that the gross margin and the contribution margin rates are holding up. So we should as I said be in a trough here and positioned for strong leverage when the volume resumes, probably in the first quarter. Moving on to CDIY, from my perspective CDIY was a pleasant surprise this quarter. Volume was still anemic. You know revenues were down 23%, organic growth down 21% but the segment profit was down only 11%. And very encouraging was the segment profit rate resumed its expansion and is now hovering around 15%, up to 110 basis points over the prior year and also up 210 basis points versus second quarter. The organic revenue declined. We’re seeing some early signs of stabilization as John alluded to and I think most encouraging here is that the Bostitch integration benefits, which yielded significant cost productivity gains in this segment, are taking hold. They’re ahead of plan. Bostitch profitability is strong and improving and I think, knock on wood, that the long saga of Bostitch related profitability problems may be in the rearview mirror. And then finally, the wave of new product introductions that is taking place in this overall segment is going to be significant in the fourth quarter and is expected to accelerate our market share gains. So stay tuned. This strong, strong franchise is going to get even stronger with an array of new, exciting products in the fourth quarter. And on top of that, we have the intensifying brand support and brand strength that I talked about earlier. So we’re very, very excited about the future here coming out of hopefully trough conditions in the marketplace. And now I’ll turn it over to Don Allan who will take you through some more color on the segments.
Donald Allan Jr.:  Thank you Jim. Page 16 is a new page we added this quarter which is a way for us to help communicate some of the key trends in the three different segments, both historical, and then some of our thoughts going forward here in the short term.  So if we start with the Security segment, which is on the left side of the chart, the top part of the chart gives a historical trend of the segment profit rate which is the line and then the bar graphs are the unit volume declines that we’ve experienced in each segment.  So as we dive a little bit deeper into Security and start with the convergent business, convergent revenues as you know from installations has been down but we believe its likely bottomed out in the second quarter. And we also think that attrition peaked in the second quarter as well. And we’re beginning to experience some stabilization in our order rates in the convergent business which is a positive sign. One thing that we’ve discussed in previous calls is commercial construction and some of the delayed and abandoned projects that we’ve seen. That continues to be a headwind. But the good news in that particular story is that it’s still more of a delayed situation versus an abandonment of projects. And as long as that continues, that trend, then we believe that we’ll be able to continue to show modest declines and eventually growth in this segment over time. Focusing on commercial construction as an impact to our company, as many of you know from the end market charts that we provided in the past, it’s important to remind you that commercial construction is only 15% of our Security segment and only slightly greater than 10% of the total company. So even though we are experiencing a little bit of headwind there, it’s important to keep in mind that it’s not a very significant portion of our total company. And last but certainly not least, as Jim mentioned in the previous slides, the profit rate accretion in Security has been a very good story considering the declining volume environment we experienced over the last seven quarters where we’ve gone from a 16% segment profit rate in the first quarter of ’08 up to almost 21% in this particular third quarter. And that’s really all those actions Jim mentioned around pricing with our customers, cost actions and then as some benefit of deflation in commodities, and in particular mechanical Security business.  Shifting to Industrial in the middle of the page, clearly Industrial proven in this particular set of businesses is lagging behind CDIY in particular and obviously Security. And as [inaudible] we continue to see improvement in Industrial production data, which is showing positive growth and moderating signs. However, our business does lag those indicators and we would expect that we would eventually feel that positive impact as that trend continues, likely in early 2010. The inventory corrections have clearly been significant throughout the year and will likely continue at a modest pace in the fourth quarter of ’09.  We believe the profit rate has stabilized but we would expect improvement in that profit rate to be likely in the fourth quarter, as many of the cost actions will be completed in our European operations and we do believe that those inventory corrections will abate. Last but certainly not least is the CDIY segment. As you can see, Jim mentioned this, that the operating margin rate or the profit rate has gone to 14.8%. So it went from the bottom at 6.4% in the fourth quarter of last year and has really kind of emerged back to very normalized levels for this segment, or very close to normalized levels. But economic conditions continue to be a little tough in this area, although we’re starting to see a little bit of positive signs. In particular, the U.S. housing starts have stabilized. We believe they’ve bottomed out. Consumer confidence is improving in both the U.S. and the Euro region in comparison to the second quarter of this year. And as a result, you’re seeing the impact in our revenues as our revenues are flattening out on a sequential basis when you look at the second and the third quarter. And we would expect that trend to likely continue into the fourth quarter. We do expect to experience some modest revenue growth in the beginning of 2010 or the first quarter of 2010 if these trends continue.  And last but certainly not least that significant profit rate as I mentioned is largely due to the CT&S and Bostitch integration that Jim discussed. So we feel like that’s a nice summary of our three segments and key trends based on history and then some thoughts going forward.  Moving to free cash flow which was a really nice story this quarter, our third quarter free cash flow exceeded prior year levels and that was while our continuing ops earnings was actually down from $78 million to $62 million or 21%. Another item to focus on here is working capital. As John mentioned earlier, a very nice working capital performance where we had a positive working capital benefit and cash flow of $32 million when we had a 20% unit volume decline in the same quarter. One thing I want to point out here is the other line. If you look at last year, John had mentioned that the sale of CST, there’s a gain of $84 million that’s showing as a negative in other last year and also the taxes paid on that of about $34 million, which is really driving that. And the total of that is close $120 million of a negative out flow. So if you remove that, it’s a slight positive and its more in line with the $25 million positive that we saw in the third quarter of this year. CapEx continues to be a good story as we continue to control where we’re spending our money and make sure we’re spending it efficiently. And we’re tracking to that $85 million number for the year and on pace for that. So the end result is free cash flow of $158 million versus $103 last year, which is a 50% improvement year-over-year with earnings being down 21%.  As I mentioned on the last quarter call, we have set a guidance of $300 million of free cash flow for the year. And at that point in time we were at about $1 million of free cash flow year-to-date. Now we’re at $183 million, which would be a little more than 60% of that $300 million previous guidance we have provided. Based on the work that we’re doing in working capital and all the different efforts around SFS, we actually think that we can exceed $300 million this year. And that would be consistent with some of our historical trends if you look back through three quarters. We tend to be anywhere between 57% or 65% through three quarters in comparison to the annual objective. Moving to the balance sheet, it continues to be a positive story for us. As many of you know we’ve been focused on de-leveraging our balance sheet this year. Our goal we established was $200 million of a debt reduction or de-leveraging goal. We’ve achieved $161 million of that through three quarters so we feel like we’re tracking very nicely to that objective. And our debt to capital ratio is now down [audio impairment] which sequentially improved where it was at 46% in the second quarter. And when you adjusted for our equity and debt hybrid instruments, its now 31% to 33%, which again is an improvement from the second quarter where it was at 34 to 37%. And we feel very good about our de-leveraging plan and how we’re on track in that regard. The next page is an update on guidance. As all of you have seen we have increased our guidance compared to July, so what I’d like to do is just walk through some of the changes in that guidance. On the left side of the page, our July guidance was a range of EPS of $2.34 to $2.84, which was a $0.50 range. What was driving the bulk of that range was [audio impairment] assumption, which we assumes a negative 18 to a negative 20% at that timeframe for the year. We are starting in the start with our midpoint to that range, which is $2.59. That implied guidance assumption of about a negative 19% unit volume, which is what we’re currently estimating for the year. If we take our gross margin rate improvement that John and Jim both talked about earlier, we believe that for the year we will be approximately 40% gross margin. And in July I indicated that we thought for the second half of the year we would be somewhere between 38% and 39%. So now we believe we’re going to be above 40% in the second half. And its really being driven by all of the things that were articulated earlier around price, productivity, around cost, deflation and etc. So we feel positive about that going forward.  The last item is what we call Other, which is several different things. Clearly we’ve benefited from FX as the weaker U.S. dollar versus some of the major currencies that are prominent in our world such as the euro and the Great Britain pound. But we also think that we could have potentially lower restructuring and slightly lower taxes as well as we close out the year. I will point out that the restructuring we’ve provided, the guidance is about $45 million the previous call. We expect it to be probably somewhere to be between $40 and $45 million so it won’t be significantly lower than that number. So the end result is a current guidance range of $2.84 to $2.94. If you exclude the gain on the debt extinguishment, that means its $2.50 to $2.60, which is an increase from the $2 and $2.50 that we provided in July.  Moving to free cash flow, as I mentioned earlier we expect to exceed $300 million in free cash flow. And that’s really due primarily to two things as you can see on the chart here. First our improved earnings outlook, which is about $0.25 to $0.35 EPS. And then our continued belief that we will be able to exceed prior year working capital levels. In the fourth quarter of ’08 we achieved 5.9 working capital turns and we still feel that we will be able to achieve in excess of 6 working capital turns by the end of this year, which is all being driven by the Stanley Fulfillment System and the process controls that we’ve put in place as Jim articulated earlier on this call. So in summary, we feel like we’re well positioned to continue to gain market share. We’ve made investments as you know around our brand and in some cases advertising. We continue to invest in new product development and increase our direct to customer interactions in the Security segment in particular to really drive those results. We’re seeing modest signs of sequential improvement which are encouraging and particularly in Security and CDIY. Industrial is lagging, but we do believe is 2010 begins that that segment will begin to improve. And operating margins are on track and remain strong for the full year. And as Jim mentioned, we do feel that we’ve established a new line around gross margin, what we think we’re now a 40% gross margin company. And then last but certainly not least, we continue to be dedicated to our ongoing success of SFS, both as a source of cash as well as a competitive advantage.
Kate White: Sarah we’re ready for questions whenever you are.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Peter Lisnic.
Peter Lisnic:  I guess first question on CDIY is if you look at it in dollar terms, $100 million decline in revenue and operating income only down $6 or $7 million, can you give us some color commentary on exactly how that’s occurring in terms of the structuring savings, mix and price? Because that would seem like you know things are holding up a lot better than I thought they would be in that volume pressure.
John F. Lundgren: Yes, Pete, things are holding up better than you might think in terms of the volume pressure. The biggest driver, Jim touched on it and didn’t get much more granular than we intend to. The biggest driver is improvement within the Bostitch business. We talked about you know our intent when we started a massive improvement effort on Stanley Bostitch to take it up maybe 100 basis points a quarter for eight quarters to get it back to double-digit operating margins. We were well on the way a year-and-a-half ago with that program when Bostitch was the business within Stanley hit the hardest by the both Industrial and the domestic housing downturn.  We made the decision this time last year to basically combine the CDIY and Bostitch business, excuse me the CT&S, our consumer tools and storage, and Bostitch business which in retrospect was a good decision and we knew it was. Not only because we took a lot of cost out, you know business running separately that we were running as part of a CT&S business but it really reinvigorated the product development program, the focus on margin, added some rhythms to a business and both at the customer level and internally. That’s had a tremendous impact. We don’t intend to get in the margin by business because we found that you know all that by sub-segment, all that really does is creates more questions than it raises. But we have Bostitch back to historically I’ll say high or it’s [wide] average profitability level. That in and of itself is 70% of the improvement. Jim may want to add a little more granularity to it.
James M. Loree: Think Bostitch improvement within CDIY, Pete, and that’s the big one.
Donald Allan Jr.: And I’ll just address the other 30%, and its really a combination of all the things I talked about extensively on that gross margin page. You know the Stanley Fulfillment System, the transformational lean, the price inflation recovery and all of those elements. As well as there may be some minor mix in CDIY as well with the Bostitch improvement.
John F. Lundgren:  And I’ll just follow up so you can get in your follow without getting cut off. We’ve talked about SFS. We’ve talked about it a lot because our consumer tools and storage business was a large, well managed, global business with a global platform. They were 12 to 18 months ahead of the rest of Stanley in terms of truly implementing SFS. The S1R1 to which Jim referred. And so we’ve gained more traction quicker in that business and of course the Bostitch business has benefited from that as well.
Peter Lisnic:  A follow up question on pricing, again a plus to this quarter and plus all year. How sustainable is that? You know what piece of that is just related to unrecovered commodity costs that you’ve incurred in the past versus new products and you know proactive pricing policies, I guess?
James M. Loree:
 : Most of the 2 points is carryover. If you recall we had a big surge in inflation in the middle of last year. It was in third quarter of last year that we really aggressively implemented price increases to cover that inflation and we’ve benefited from those in the fourth quarter of last year and the first three quarters of this year. But we’re going to start to see the price realization kind of adding back to a more normalized level. It may be up 0 to 1%, something like that. And most of that will be in all likelihood in the businesses that incur some sort of commodity inflation. And we have a mixed bag there with different businesses.  And as you can imagine, with all the different commodity fluctuations that go on, if steel goes up you know the nail business is affected more dramatically than say the Security business. So you can’t really predict which segment it might occur in. But we will continue to price to our value proposition and continue to price to recover inflation as and if it occurs.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sam Darkatsh.
Sam Darkatsh: Jim in your prepared remarks you mention that in 2010 a number of the discretionary cost cuts that you made in ’09 and would likely be coming back. Can you help quantify that a little bit? And would that entirely be on the OpEx line?
James M. Loree: Yes, it would entirely be in the OpEx line. And you know there was $370 million of total cost improvements that were implemented. And of the $370, it’s our collective view here that about $100 million or so is likely to come back you know at some point. Whether they all come back next year or not we’ll see. But there are things like discretionary cuts where we may have cut travel by pick a number 40%, and maybe we’ll let 20% of that you know come back, because we have the volume to compensate for it. But that said we’ve changed a lot of our practices related to areas and you know T&E is a good example where today we have implemented extensively Telepresence, Cisco’s Telepresence. And you know that’s providing us a structural cost reduction in T&E so we don’t expect all of the T&E cuts for example to come back. And I think there’s many other stories like that you know as we look at the cost cutting. In addition to that we’ve made several structural changes in our various businesses and John already talked at length about the Bostitch and CT&S integration. That’s not coming back. You know that’s a permanent change. We also made some changes in the Industrial business where we combined and you saw the subsets and when I was going through the Industrial page we combined the management of Focom and Proto and we combined the management of Mac, supply and services in Vidmar. And those changes aren’t coming back. So we feel very comfortable that approximately 25% or so of the cost cuts will come back in successive years. And I’m not sure they’ll all be next year but that’s the way I would think about it.
Sam Darkatsh: And then where you look at raw materials right now, assuming it’s essentially flat on a go forward basis, what is the 2010 versus 2009 variance look like from a raw materials standpoint?
John F. Lundgren:  We’ve gotten to a stage where we have some pluses and some minuses but we’re not looking at any significant deflation or inflation at this time.
Donald Allan Jr.:  And I’ll add, Sam, to Jim’s point that he made during his prepared remarks, whatever benefit or I guess it was actually my prepared remarks, we obviously do this as a pretty collaborative effort. What we benefited this year from raw materials deflation and you know us well enough that 60 to 70% of our raw materials are steel, then its non-ferrous metals, plastic resin, etc. What we benefited from we’ve more than lost in volume absorption or lack thereof. So you know what’s going to affect our margins as much or more than the inflation pricing hedge or arbitrage you know is where volumes settle out next year relative to this year. But I think we’ve gotten much better at responding quickly to inflationary pressure in terms of our pricing. Jim’s words, and they’re the right ones, were you know pricing to be paid for our value proposition. And where we don’t think we have a value proposition to shrink or get out of those businesses as quickly as we can.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nigel Coe. 
Nigel Coe: You’ve talked about the CDIY margins in some length already, but just interested to get your perspective. You talked about this being sort of a mid-teen, 15% type margin business but given that Bostitch is back on track, you’ve got also some SFS coming through, if you recapture that [inaudible] volume drop, do you think margins will be sort of more towards the high teens going forward?
John F. Lundgren:  We’re not going to forecast margins by segment, Nigel. By now you should know that your question is a logical one and a fair one. We’ve just got a lot of history that says forecasting margins by segment and sub-segment, we’re never rewarded for it when we get it right or exceed it and we’re punished for it when we don’t. It’s not good for us internally or externally. It’s why we have three distinct segments that we think gives us some internal diversification, so your observations are logical but we’re simply not going to go there.
Nigel Coe:  Then maybe just going a little bit closer to home. You know you talk about the Industrial cost savings in 4Q. Can you maybe just quantify those? And I’m assuming that they will be sufficient to get you back into the double digits in 4Q.
James M. Loree: You’re looking for a quantification of the Industrial cost savings in the fourth quarter that might be incremental to what was in the third quarter? Is that the question?
Donald Allan Jr.:  Because of the European action.
James M. Loree: Oh, yes. It would be difficult to put an exact number on that but you know I would say that the cost reductions we implemented were roughly distributed equivalently across the three segments. Security was a little bit less than CDIY and Industrial. So on a proportionate basis you know the $370 was allocated essentially that way. And so it’s fair to say that if Industrial is you know pick a number, 25% of the revenues roughly, then 25% of the $370 applies to Industrial and you can assume that probably about you know 10 to 20% of that is yet to be materialized.
Donald Allan Jr.: And Nigel we know you’re not going to get to ask a follow up. That’s just the way the process works. But to just elaborate a little further, the other point being 50% of our business in Europe is Industrial. So some of the costs will come back as Jim referred to. But some of the cost actions we’ve taken as you understand well, it does take longer to realize the benefits of those cost actions in Europe. So there’s as large a benefit but a meaningful delay in [audio impairment]. That will provide a little bit of an offset to the costs coming back. So we’re looking for sequential improvement.
James M. Loree: And just to be clear about my math, if we say 25% of $400 is $100, then you know 10 to 20 of that might actually be yet to be realized, you know we’re talking $10 to $20 million. That’s annualized so you’d have to divide it by 4. So that’s probably roughly ballpark what you could expect there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard.
Eric Bosshard: I have two questions. First of all, I understand not projecting margins by segment, but getting to that 20% margin in Security, that was a long, long ago projection so it’s nice to see that number achieved after the long ride.
James M. Loree:  Well we took a lot of heat for like four or five years which is why John said what he said.
Eric Bosshard: The two questions that I have, first of all you talked bullishly about the CDIY volumes and that you saw improvement across a number of regions, the U.S. volumes I think in CDIY were identical, the year-over-year decline was identical, 3Q as it was in 2Q. And you mentioned in your script that you thought actually you could have some growth out of that segment in the first quarter, so I’d love to get a little bit more color on what’s going on in terms of the improvement there. And should we see improvement in 4Q? And then secondly, can you just talk about the incremental cost saves that you should achieve in 2010 from the programs that have been implemented over the last nine months.
John F. Lundgren:
 : If we start with the CDIY question, as I mentioned in that particular chart you know we’re clearly seeing a stabilization effect in that particular business. And even some modest improvements. And its really being driven by the two economic factors that I mentioned in the U.S. as well as in Europe. So as we look at the business going forward, you know we don’t expect a dramatic improvement in the fourth quarter around revenue. There could be a slight improvement due to some new products roll outs in that particular quarter. But at this point in time we’re not anticipating that. But in the first quarter we do expect to see some modest improvement in growth in that particular segment because we will first of all have anniversaried a lot of the significant declines. And its under the presumption that these economic conditions have stabilized around housing starts and consumer confidence in particular. And we’ll begin to see very modest growth rates there. The second question was around carryover effect I believe. As Jim mentioned you know we do have about $100 million of cost carryover into next year. And so we had $370 million of costs that were executed on, $265 are 2009 [audio impairment]. And then about $100 [audio impairment] or more [audio impairment]. The real question is how much of that will be sustained and Jim gave a lot of feedback [audio impairment]. Over time, which he was referring more to long term, 25% of that will probably creep back into the system. That does not mean in 2010 that $100 million of costs will creep back into the system to offset the carryover effect that we expect to experience. [Audio impairment] estimate for 2010 that you know we would be able to maintain anywhere from 50% to 75% of that carryover in 2010.
Kate White:  Sarah, we can move to the next person.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kenneth Zener.
Kenneth Zener: I wonder if you could comment on Security integration, to maintain your growing share and how that relates to you know the people you’ve acquired so your feet on the street approach, your market share enhancement and if that really did impact smaller accounts.
James M. Loree: I think I understand your question, Ken. Let’s start with we’ve made one mid-sized acquisition in the last two years and it’s going extraordinarily well. We at this stage would regard Sonitrol and HSM as fully integrated and functioning as a very cohesive unit under Brett Bontrager’s and Tony [Barley’s] direction. You know producing nice margins, doing a good job on national accounts, as you know we have a very strong presence in retail. Retailers in general are under a lot of pressure so when a retailer goes out of business the objective is to get more than our fair share of re-signs, which we are doing and doing a pretty good job at. So we’re maintaining or gaining share with national accounts and Tony’s team’s doing a real nice job with some of the smaller businesses, you know rolling them up and gaining share at the local level. In Europe, the GDP acquisition hasn’t a full year anniversary yet. I can say that’s going very well at the same time. As we’ve mentioned on previous calls, our Security business in Europe is relatively small. It was UK centric. We’ve inherited an extraordinarily capable management team with GDP, a management team that was interested in carrying on with Stanley. And they’ve done a very, very nice job leveraging their strong market position and gaining share, primarily in France and Belgium where they’re a strong number two in the marketplace as well as expanding across borders. So I hope that gets at the question you were asking.
Kenneth Zener:  And then could you talk about the contribution from the load in or sales that you expect as the hardware reloads and how that can impact 2010 organic?
John F. Lundgren: Sure. We’re happy to do that. Go ahead Jim.
James M. Loree: Ken, you may not recall because I don’t think you were following us at the time, maybe you were, February ’07 analyst meeting we talked extensively about the loss of a major customer in the hardware business which actually cost us over $50 million of lost revenue. And we indicated at the time that we would pursue other customers because we really believe in the strong brand pull and user demand for Stanley hardware in the marketplace. And so we indicated at the time we thought for various reasons we weren’t going to recover anytime soon with the customer we lost the business with that we thought we would pursue other customers, and in fact committed at the time to replace at least 50% of the lost revenue over the coming years. And as it turns out I think this program that we’re implementing right now with about 300 stores into it and has about 1,400 to go next year, annualized it should have an impact of greater than $30 million and next year probably three-quarters of that.
John F. Lundgren: So simply said we’ve replaced more than 60% of the lost business and we think in due course we will have replaced it all. But its going to take another year or so to get us there.
Operator: Your last question comes from Michael Rehaut.
Michael Rehaut:  The first question just and I know you don’t get into you know forecasting by segment, but more just trying to get a sense of timing if you will. You know when you look at the CDIY improvement and you know certainly a good portion of that from Bostitch but also from your you know productivity in SFS, etc., you know I would assume obviously you’re doing a lot in the industrial segment as you’ve been mentioning as well, can you give us a sense of timing in terms of perhaps when you might expect those cost saves you’ve mentioned that you would expect them to bear fruit in 4Q, but are we looking at like a 12 month or 24 month improvement? Or maybe even shorter than 12 months, given the solid improvement that we’ve seen in CDIY?
Donald Allan Jr.: Mike, this is Don. I’ll be happy to answer that question. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, our cost programs have been fully executed except for the European actions and some small actions in our CT&S and Bostitch integration. We would expect by the end of this year 2009 that all the European actions will be complete and behind us. And Jim mentioned that you know on an annualized basis those actions in Europe probably add up to about $20, $25 million on an annualized basis. So by the end of this year those cost actions will be complete and behind us. And what I was referring to earlier for 2010, around $100 million of carryover, that would be the carryover costs of all the actions that we completed this year. And that’s specifically what I was referring to.
Michael Rehaut: And just a second question, you know on the new product rollout that you’ve mentioned. You know earlier in the presentation you talked about you believe it’s going to be a very positive impact, market share gains, etc., a wave of new products and I think I heard towards the end of the presentation perhaps Don you had been talking about more of a slight improvement from new product rollouts. So I’m just trying to maybe reconcile those two comments and trying to get a sense of what actually you’re expecting in terms of a contribution to sale growth.
John F. Lundgren: Mike, this is John. I guess two things. As you know because you’ve followed us a long time, we have a tried, tested and proven, steadfast, etched in stone rule. We don’t talk about or show a new product to the investment community until our customers have seen it. That’s served us well over time. And that won’t change. You’ve been invited to and hope you can make our we think very comprehensive analyst meeting on November 17 in New York where our business heads, specifically Jeff Ansell, Brett Bontrager, Justin Boswell and Jim and three of his leaders in the Industrial segment will be talking about all of their products. Then you’ll actually be able to see them because we will have presented them to the customers. We intend to have a vitality index that stays above 25%.  And the reason I couldn’t answer your question even if I wanted to, you know that’s what’s new, how much of it is incremental, we were very pleasantly surprised when we introduced FatMax Xtreme as a good example, going back a year or two, that far less of the Xtreme volume cannibalized FatMax. So in fact that was a much bigger lift on a net basis than we’d anticipated. We have no way to predict that at this stage so I couldn’t answer your question if I wanted to other than historically. You know we’ve had as much as $70 million on an annual basis of revenue growth from new products. The question is that’s never 100% incremental. Its how much of its cannibalized and it remains to be seen.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. We now turn the call back over to you, Miss White.
Kate White: We want to thank everybody for participating in our call and our webcast today. As I said at the beginning of the call if you’ve any questions or need further information, please feel free to reach out to me.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator:  Good morning. My name is Jennifer and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Stanley Works second quarter 2009 results conference call. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. At this time I would like to hand the call over to Ms. White. Please go ahead.
Kate White: Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, this is Kate White, the Director of Investor Relations for the Stanley Works. Thank you all for joining us on the Stanley Works second quarter 2009 conference call this morning. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, Stanley's Chairman and CEO, Jim Loree, Stanley's Executive Vice President and COO and Don Allan, Stanley's Vice President and CFO. I would like to point out that our second quarter earnings release, which was issued this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call are available on our home page, which is www.stanleyworks.com. This morning John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's second quarter 2009 results and various other topical matters followed by a Q&A session. The entire call is expected to last approximately one hour and a replay of the call will be available at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and access code are in our press release and as always feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions after today's call at 860-827-3833. We will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in Form 8-K, which we have filed with today's press release and in our most recent 34-A. With that I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.
John Lundgren: Thanks, Kate and good morning everybody. Let me start just with an overview as I think that many of you have said it has been helpful in the past on how we see the state of affairs at Stanley and just some of the highlights from the quarter. We did post GAAP earnings of $0.89 that included a $0.34 gain on the extinguishment of debt, so our normalized EPS from continuing operations was $0.55. You'll recall that the debt to which I'm referring was $103 million of our ETPS instrument that we used to finance the FACOM acquisition in 2006. It was a great opportunity and our treasury department capitalized on that. We also announced a $50 million cost-reduction program due to the steeper than expected unit volume declines in the second quarter and about half of that will be realized during 2009. I think it's important to stay ahead of the curve given the volume softness but I think it's equally important to note that the lion's share of the cuts that were recently implemented were in the areas of G&A and not at the expense of brand support and important future growth initiatives. We are really pleased with our gross margin of 39.9%. It was a record for the Stanley Works, despite the 24% drop in unit volume versus the prior year. Jim and Don are going to provide a walk later showing you how we got there, as well as why we believe we'll stay at or near that level for the second half of the year. Security posted an 8% revenue growth and a 13% profit growth. A lot of that due to acquisition but organic growth fell only 8% in the midst of this environment, which to us further validates our belief that while the segment that security isn't immune from macroeconomic downturns, it's certainly well insulated and it's certainly more resistant than many other businesses. We did see some indications within our CDIY segment with year-over-year sales trends are showing us some signs of improvement. More detail on that in the segment breakup. On Monday, we announced a dividend increase for the 42nd consecutive year, 3.1% to $0.33 per quarter. It's obviously an important element of our total shareholder return. It also reflects our confidence in future cash flow generation, and our ability to achieve our forecasts. We're also quite proud of the fact that it's the longest consecutive annual record of an industrial company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Our Stanley Fulfillment System and the Processes contained therein remain a top focus for us and the majority of our free cash flow we are going to generate in the second half of the year and that we have generated in the quarter did come from working capital improvements. We think it's a very credible achievement in the current reduced volume environment. We have had a lot of questions running up to the call with respect to free cash flow, our forecast as well as our ability to achieve it. Don is going to provide quite a bit more insight on that towards the end of the presentation, but I think it is important to note up front that three of the last four years, more than two-thirds of Stanley's free cash flow came in the second half of the year. This is not a new phenomenon for Stanley and Don will, I think, help provide more clarity and transparency on our projections. Moving on to worldwide revenues, volume and sales essentially were down everywhere. The market slowdown has affected all regions where a year ago we were able to report growth in every region of the country. The US of course is most important, it represents almost 59% of Stanley's revenues and we were down 14% in total, 20% organically. Europe was most heavily impacted, down 25% organically and 30% in total. The other regions also were down comparably. It is probably important to note, Australia relatively small region but important to Stanley and the impacts of both currency and volume declines did have an impact on our business. Now the US, as I mentioned, is showing, I will say, signs of strength or maybe better said stability. It obviously entered the recession earlier and based on historical precedent, could be expected to emerge earlier. Also just arithmetically we are facing our lower comps in the first and second quarters as we will go through the second half of the year. Moving on to slide five, we don't normally spend a lot of time on this call talking about the macroeconomic environment or things that everyone on this call can read about and read the same documents we do, but, given the extent to which it affects our business in general and our industrial segment in particular, we thought we'd spend a minute on it, as well as include some data that we think is quite revealing in the appendix. The GDP declines accelerated through the first quarter, particularly in Europe, as most countries fell into recession and it particularly affected our CDIY and industrial segments, and that was reflected in our results. We don't have it on this page, but you'll see in the appendix after quarters, of about minus 1.7, 1.8, both the UK and the continental Europe or the Euro zone, GDP was down almost 5%, 4.9% in both cases. The US GDP outlook indicates a continued decline with based on current projections, a slight abatement in the fourth quarter. After mid 2% declines, 3.7% followed by the current projection of minus 1.4 in the fourth quarter. I mention all this, because it's quite consistent with our outlook, for the business in general, the environment in which we are operating, as well as it relates to installations in our security business that Jim's going to talk a lot more about later. Industrial production declines are leveling off. That's the chart that you see at the bottom of this page. As we've talked about on earlier calls, the declines came much later in Europe than in the US. The fall was steeper and sharper, but of late has shown relative stability and I think that's quite clear, just graphically looking at the chart, the left being the UK and the right being continental Europe or essentially the Euro zone. Last but not least, construction project delays have accelerated but the abandoned projects have stabilized. There's a lot of detail, you can look at later on page 26 of our appendix, but again it is consistent with what we're seeing in our security business and as a consequence we're going to spend more time on this call than normal, trying to relate installations to RMR by size of project and type of project and I think that you will find that quite helpful in understanding what's driving our security business and what's contributing to its stability. Let's turn quickly to the results. There is nothing on chart 6 that isn't contained in more detail in the press release. Our GAAP earnings of $0.89 including the $0.34 gain from extinguishing the debt, normalized EPS of $0.55 as I said, operating margins down but still strong given the high level of volume declines and tax rate was actually 100 basis points higher. It's primarily business mix with lower earnings, in foreign countries our blended tax rate obviously increases. Looking quickly at revenues, on the next page, we see first quarter 15% decline followed by a 20% decline in the second quarter. Sources of growth or lack thereof to be more correct, volume down 24% which has been our focus, price held up fairly well. Currency remained a headwind but slightly less than in the first quarter, it was minus 4%, acquisitions contributed 6%; so in total you see revenues down 20%. On the right-hand side I won't spend much time on this because Jim's going to walk you through each segment but the number that jumps off the page is 40% in the industrial segment. We're going to talk to that and how we think that looks going forward. I did mention that at the outset, one of the highlights, certainly of the quarter was gross margin, and the achievement and how we're thinking about that going forward. I am going to pass the baton to Jim who is going to walk us through margin performance and take a look at the segments, and then he is going to turn it over to Don.
Jim Loree: Okay. Thanks, John. I must say, when I look at long-term trends, I love this chart almost as I love our ten-year cash flow history chart. This is a very positive trend for us with 39.9% gross margin in the second quarter, up a 160 basis points versus the second quarter of '08 where we were at 38.3. As you look at the long-term trend, it clearly is a positive trend and corroborating the theory that our gross margin percent then correlates with the strength and the differentiation of our value propositions. This performance, in particular, this year has been key to avoiding the steep declines in the operating margin rate that we otherwise would have faced in the phase of the volume challenges that we've had that are market-related. We were able to do this while bringing our year-over-year inventories down about $100 million or 17% over the prior year. The real story implied by this chart is the transformation of the company both strategically and with respect to our operational excellence. What this means when you step back from it is that, we are extraordinarily well positioned for operating leverage in any kind of a growth environment. Slow growth environment will be just fine, we'll be able to generate significant operating leverage. As we move to SG&A, I think we've also done a fairly good job of focusing on resizing our SG&A to calibrate with the revenue size implied by the current economic environment. When you look at the 255 and adjust it for the 23 million associated with acquisitions, the expenses are actually down 18% versus the second quarter of '08, just slightly less than our organic revenue decline. So, in a pretty good shape there. We've been able to do this while reinvesting about $20 million annualized in security sales force ads, particularly in the convergent business and in our Major League Baseball brand awareness campaign, which this quarter we've now added Yankee Stadium and the stadium where the Toronto Blue Jays play. So we now have brought our MLB presence up to 10 teams this quarter. Moving on to security, a look at the security segment, a great story. The business now running at an annualized revenue run rate of about $1.6 billion with revenues in the quarter of approximately $390 million or up 8%. Segment profit, up in double digits. The profit rate, not a new record but is certainly an excellent performance at 19%, up 80 basis points over the prior year. Convergent revenues grew 29%, clearly benefiting from acquisitions, including Sonitrol and GDP which added, when taken in combination with some smaller acquisitions, about $50 million of growth in the quarter. The monitoring margins expanded from the continued excellent execution by the team in convergent. The organic recurring monthly revenue was up 9% and the acquisitions brought us some great accretion as well. I'm going to talk in a little bit more detail about the recurring revenue and the revenue picture in convergent, because there is a real story there which I'd like everybody to understand in the face of negative 8% organic growth for the segment, overall segment. I think you'll see that the convergent business is quite healthy as well as the mechanical business. Mechanical business had a 7% revenue decrease which was buffered by what we believe to be some share gains in a really tough market environment, realized good price and kept their cost structure in line, and managed their working capital very well, down $16 million during the or versus the prior second quarter of last year. I want to spend a few moments, as I mentioned, on the improving mix in electronic security. When you just simply look at the organic revenue decline in convergent, it doesn't really tell the whole story. You have to kind of peel a few layers apart here. If we look at the US, and we look at the sub-segments within US convergent, we have large projects, national accounts and core commercial. The installation margins and the recurring revenue content of those particular businesses is correlated in exactly that order. So the large projects are the lowest margin and then the core commercial are of the highest margin. And what you have there are steep organic installation revenue declines, large projects down greater than 30%, national accounts down somewhat greater than 20%, and the core commercial business, down less than 10%. So single digit organic installation revenue decreases in those businesses. And as you can see, the core commercial and the national accounts really represent the bulk of the business. The large projects are really more of a legacy from the prior, pre-HSM Sonitrol business. What's really interesting here when you look at it is the RMR, new RMR sales. So that is the new RMR that was added in the quarter, as a percent of the installation revenue sales is increasing across all three of those segments but it's increasing dramatically in the core commercial which indicates that the sales ads that we've been making and the compensation plan changes that we have made to really focus folks on the core commercial accounts in this environment, as well as the recurring revenue content, are really paying off and obviously the recurring revenue has a much higher gross margin than the installation revenue regardless of the segment. So in effect what you have here is a very, very positive mix change going on which is allowing us to weather this economic storm in good stead. And as you can see at the bottom, the sales force ads, the emphasis on recurring revenue and decreased dependants on the lower margin were cyclical large project business is helping us. We grew our organic recurring monthly revenue by 9% in the quarter despite the 8% organic decline in the overall segment, and that itself is a big reason why the segment profit was up 13%. So that is a great story in my view. As we move to industrial, this is a very, very difficult market situation that our industrial folks are facing. Revenues down 40%, organic revenue down 36%, problems in the markets in both US and Europe. Segment profit down only 56% in the face of a 40% revenue decline, while not great. It certainly is a good story that we're able to contain it to that level. The segment profit coming in at 9.4% is pretty much a low point over the last few years for this particular segment. The industrial channels were definitely down more than the automotive channels, that makes sense when you think about the benefits from the aging car fleet in the United States in particular. We believe that inventory corrections represented about 50% of the overall decline in the segment, and then the just lower production volumes and weak economy in terms of inherent demand really represented the rest. When I say inventory corrections, I'm talking about drastic inventory corrections throughout the supply chain of our customers and the entire industry. The storage business though was kind of consistent and maybe not quite as steep in terms of revenue declines and pretty much on a par sequentially. I think a couple of positive things; we really believe we are maintaining our share in this very difficult market. We have taken aggressive cost actions and we know that, not all of our competitors have done that, which is good. We do feel like the market here is stabilizing, albeit at a very low level, and our cost actions while somewhat delayed due to the concentration of this particular segment in Europe are kicking in, and that we're likely at a trough in this particular quarter in terms of segment profit rate. Finally MAC is doing quite well. Our financing program with GreenSky is intact. We will not have to take any receivables associated with financing onto our balance sheet as a result. So a couple of highlights there, but in general, a pretty tough story in that particular segment. Moving on to Construction & DIY , very encouraged by the profit rate in this segment, coming in at 11.3% on the heels of a 9.5 performance in the first quarter and a 6.4% trough performance in the fourth quarter of last year. So we were pleased with that. I think the cost actions are definitely kicking in. The revenue is stabilizing in this particular segment and even showing some very faint signs of improvement. We won't get euphoric at all, but point of sale is steady to slightly up, inventories at the customer level are stable and organic growth seems to be stabilizing in the kind of minus 20% sort of a range. It was minus 19 in the first quarter, minus 23 in this quarter, but as the quarter went on, it was a slightly better picture sequentially. So, we're feeling good about the stability frankly in this segment. I think we also believe that as we do start to see some signs of improvement in the economy that this will be in all likelihood an early cycle improver in our portfolio. The final thing I'll say here is that the Bostitch integration that we undertook in the earlier part of this year is well underway and on-track and really is a positive for much more positive than just the cost reduction aspect of it as we talked about last quarter. With that I'll turn it over to Don Allan.
Don Allan: Thanks, Jim. As both John and Jim have mentioned earlier today, we have talked a little bit about our acquisition impact and the positive accretion we're seeing in our margin rate. So here on page 14, you can see that we wanted to give you a quick update on primarily our 2008 acquisitions. What we have here are three acquisitions that we did in 2008 that represent about 85% of the total acquisitions in that year, and in particular there's Sonitrol, Xmark and Generale de Protection. This chart we've shown over the years in various presentations around our integration process and how we drive significant synergy realization through that process. You can see that each one of the acquisitions has a significant accretive impact from where they were on their operating margin percentage before we acquired them. As an example, Sonitrol with 22% operating margin, a very strong operating margin to start with and now it's after the integration process has been complete it's greater than 30%. So some of the key features we thought we'd touch on in our integration process, just as a reminder to all of you, that we go through a very robust processes especially in the first 100 to 180 days and we develop an integration plan actually in advance of the closing of the acquisition that has the target management teams buy-in in essence before we close on the transaction. Then subsequent to that we go through a weekly and monthly senior management pulsing process and many of those acquisitions include John, Jim and myself in those pulsing processes. We've developed some very experienced integration managers primarily over the last five years. They really understand our process and how to drive these benefits. Then last but certainly not least making sure that we do have a native or in-country integration team and that was very critical and a great example of that is for GdeP. So as we move forward to working capital, we feel like we've continued to exhibit good control over our working capital as our working capital dollars decline 21% inline with or slightly better than the revenue decline of 20% which resulted in working capital turns improving from four-eight in the second quarter of last year to 4.9 this year. So if we dissect working capital a little bit and look at the three different pieces, why don't we start with accounts receivable because it's certainly been a terrific story for us especially in the last three or four quarters and we continue to see that in the second quarter of this year, down 29% to about $650 million and well outpacing the decline that we saw on revenue and really what's driving that out performances our focus on delinquencies. As we've mentioned in previous calls we started a robust set of processes around ensuring our delinquencies around A-R are minimized and compared to last year we had about a $70 million decline in delinquencies. Next is inventories, Jim mentioned and John mentioned inventories are down 17% versus last year. What's very impressive as well is that if you look at the first quarter of this year our DSI was 83 days and now we've moved on to 77 days. So we're seeing sequential improvement, which is really the benefits of our SFS processes and primarily in this area would be our sales, operations and planning rhythms that we've put in place over the last few years and they continue to mature and we see the effect of that as we're able to really drive our inventories down very close to being in line with the revenue declines. The one negative at this point is really payables, payables is a user of cash year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, but you're really seeing the effect of the inventory reduction as well as the expense and CapEx reductions we've been driving toward this is year that are pushing that number down. We expect that to really stabilize through the remainder of the year and the bulk of that decrease is behind us. Moving to free cash flow, which is clearly benefiting from that working capital performance, as we saw positive working capital benefit in the second quarter of $30 million. One item of note here in our free cash flow is that John mentioned the gain on the debt extinguishment, so we have about 27 million of income and the net income line associated with that. Then this other line of $91 million is where that gets backed out. So it's not included in our operating cash flow. Some other things in that other line include reductions in accrued expenses, some derivative settlements as well as restructuring payments that we've made associated with our various cost reduction actions that we started in December of last year. So our performance in general was really driven by working capital, and free cash flow. We feel good based on the second quarter performance that we can achieve our $300 million estimate for this year. I'll walk through that in a little more detail a few pages from now. Shifting to the balance sheet, we continue to feel good about our position on our balance sheet. We've had our debt to cap ratio move down slightly from what it was in the first quarter, down to 46%. Then when we adjust from that for a hybrid equity and debt instruments, it's somewhere between 34% and 37%. So it's close to where we expected it to be for this period of time. As we mentioned in previous calls, we're driving towards an objective of trying to deleverage ourselves by about $200 million this year, and that continues to be an important priority and we've made it, some nice progress so far through six months where we've deleveraged ourselves by about $70 million in that time frame. So we feel like we're on track to achieving those goals at this stage. Focusing on guidance, which is the next page and I want to spend a little bit of time on this page, make sure we understand what's going on here, if you focus on the left side of the page which is EPS, these are changes compared to our last guidance that we've provided in April. The first item is a revised 2009 unit volume outlook. As John mentioned, we believe for the year we're going to be down negative 18% to negative 20% as we saw negative 19% and negative 24% in the first two quarters of this year for unit volume declines. That would be an implied negative 14% to negative 18% in the second half of this year. In essence it represents really the run rate that we're experiencing on unit volume, and it, when you have the easing of the comps in the back half of the year as we were down negative 7% and negative 10% in the third and the fourth quarter of 2008 is why that number gets smaller compared to what experienced in the first half of the year. The impact of each point of a decline, as we mentioned previously, is about $0.20 EPS, so as a result it's a dollar negative EPS to our previous guidance provided. That being said you heard a lot of the good performance we experienced in gross margin rate and with 39.6% in the first quarter and 39.9% in the second quarter. We expect that in the second half of the year we will experience similar rates, probably in the range of 38% to 39% that will drive a margin rate improvement and offset about three quarters of that negative unit volume that we are expecting to experience for the year. That's really the trend that we have seen in the first half of the year. So we are expecting that to continue in the back half of the year as we see those benefits in gross margin. That being said, we felt that there still was a gap to our objectives of achieving $2 and $2.50 EPS that we laid out in April of about $0.25. So we embarked on the new restructuring program that John mentioned earlier that would provide about $25 million of benefit in the back half of the year. A little bit of detail on that, the whole program is $50 million of annualized cost actions that we executed and completed in the month of July. At this stage about 35% of it is headcount related and about 90% of it is associated with SG&A as John mentioned. So that results in a total set of actions of $265 million in 2009. When you combine it with the previous two sets of actions we have done, which commenced in December of 2008. The last item on here that is changing is obviously the gain on the debt extinguishment of $0.34, affects our guidance that we provided previously. So that gives us an end result of $2.34 to $2.84 guidance range, if you adjust for the gain it's consistent with the range that we provided last quarter of $2 and $2.50. All the other factors that around FX and previous cost actions, acquisitions and restructuring charges are consistent with our previous guidance. We believe that the restructuring charges of $45 million is still the appropriate number for this year, as we've seen a little bit of benefit in our European restructuring program at a lower cost, and we are able to utilize that excess to pay for the current actions that we just embarked on. Moving to free cash flow, which is a topic that many of us are interested in. As we mentioned previously on the call, we believe that $300 million in free cash flow is achievable for this year, and it's based on several factors. Let me start with a little bit of historical and analytical information. John had mentioned that three of the last four years, 67% of our free cash flow occurred in the back half of the year. In this particular case, if you assume that the $300 million is achieved, that means we'd achieve about $200 million of free cash flow in the back half of 2009, which would imply about $225 million free cash flow. The other factor to look at is that, our second quarter is also an indicator of the year as well. Our second quarter in the last two years tends to represent about 15% of the total year of free cash flow. So if you take this year's second quarter performance, that would calculate to about $285 million of free cash flow, so that gives you a range of somewhere between 225 and 285. So why do we think we can do above and beyond that to get to $300 million? It's really predicated on that release that we can achieve a 10% working capital turn improvement over last year's performance of 5.9. If you remember in the fourth quarter of last year, we had 5.9 working capital turns. We believe that we can get to 6.5, 6.7 working capital turns, because of the detailed plans that we've put in place in our businesses to ensure that we're driving towards those types of objectives. Each business under the Stanley's fulfillment system processes and rhythms has those plans in place and are being pulsed on a regular basis, and they have to do with transformational lean techniques as well as continued enhancements of our sales and operation planning processes as they mature. Really our ability to increase our dividend was indicative of our belief that we can achieve this $300 million free cash flow. So in summary, we believe that we're well positioned to gain market share as we've done appropriate actions along way to ensure that our cost base is adjusted. We have also made certain key investments along the way that both John and Jim have indicated earlier. Our gross margin success in the first two quarters is very pleasing to us and we believe that we can largely maintain that for the remainder of the year. We continue to be focused on paying down our debt as I mentioned $200 million in 2009 and we feel like we're on track to achieve that so far. Then last but certainly not least, our dedication and focus on SFS. We believe that's a significant source of cash for us and ultimately is a competitive advantage for Stanley. So that concludes our presentation portion of the call.
Kate White: Jennifer, we'd like to start the Q&A portion of the call right now.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jim Lucas from Janney Montgomery.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery: I wanted to ask a specific question on the industrial side of the business. With the inventory corrections seeking out there, could you maybe give us a little bit more color of what you're seeing in terms of customers just still needing liquidity and using inventory correction for that versus what they're seeing in terms of their ability to get access to credit. And going forward, are inventory levels now to a point where stock outs are potentially occurring or is this just resetting to the new demand levels?
John Lundgren: Hey, Jim. This is John. I'll start and turn it over to Jim who is going to give you even little more detail. Remember we are talking industrial and we've learned a lot in the last month or so. I would say up until then we would have thought of third of the volume decline was due to destocking. We've done a lot of granular analysis that caused us to raise that estimate to 50%. Importantly a huge portion of that for us is in Europe. It has had a tremendous impact on Facom's volume declines that's where a lot of our updated guidance or updated analysis comes from. Hard to talk about out of stocks in the industrial segment given the B to B short delivery cycles, a lot of it through distribution but I don't know if Jim add even a little more color to that because he has been doing a lot of work on Proto Facom, MAC in particular and as well as some of our storage businesses.
Jim Loree: Yes, I mean I think the key to the inventory correction phenomenon is really the word of caution on the part of the customers and it derives from both liquidity concerns, concerns about what the ultimate size of the market really is and just overall questions that I think the distributors have in their minds about the business model that they are going to have on a prospective basis and how much volume is really going to be there. Nobody wants to get caught with their pants down on inventory in the chain and what they are finding is they can have where they used to have 20 SKUs on a rack. They can have 20 units of a SKU on a rack they can now have two and order much more frequently. To an extent that's okay because it keeps them liquid and in business. However, at some point in time the overall market's ability to deal with that issue or that situation changes when the demand returns and those SKUs units go off direct faster and we can't replenish them fast enough to meet the end market demands. So I think we're going to see in my estimation we're going to see a fairly significant rebound in terms of this inventory restocking as opposed to destocking. I don't know when that's going to occur. We have incorporated a neutral into our outlook on a prospective basis for the remainder of the year. However, if there were to be some significant restocking that would be a positive.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery: So is the key going to be order activity in terms of what you are going to get from a visibility standpoint given that short cycle order what they need as opposed to building out quite a bit that's needed?
Jim Lorry: I think we're prepared to respond without question despite the fact that our inventories are in really good shape. We are prepared to respond. The Stanley fulfillment system has been instrumental in terms of bringing our lead times down across the various businesses including industrial. So I think visibility to the order patterns is good. I think that what we really need in the chain is some confidence restoration at the customer level and when they start to see signs that demand will recover at some level on a year-over-year basis. I think we'll start to see that restocking occur and we'll be prepared to serve at that time.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery: Okay. Final question on this topic. When you look at across the multiple end markets, is this very broad-based? Are you seeing when you say industrial, are there any particular end markets that are jumping out and then with regards to SFS, could you maybe give us a little bit more color of what type of lead time reductions you've experienced?
John Lundgren: Yes, first of all, Jim, I say it's broad spread. That's why I mentioned it as we look at our industrial segment, in the sense that sub-segments, industrial and automotive tools, industry and automotive repair and, if you will, infrastructure solutions. Only the latter of those three which is less than 20% of the segment has long lead times. There we've cut the lead times dramatically. In more importantly in things like Vidmar boxes, we've build a Vidmar box in a day. There's not much lead time to be cut from that. So, our businesses very well. In our made-for-stock tool businesses, the Proto's, the Mac's, the Facom's, we've already taken 25% and more out of our lead times. A lot of that has come from when and if we source components, the rest of it has just come from leading out our factories so it's going to vary dramatically by business. Some, always room to improve but approach world-class, Vidmar being a classic example and then 25% to 40% coming out of lead times, some of which didn't start at world-class levels for the rest of our industrial businesses.
Operator: Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning, guys. It's actually [Mark] stepping in for Eric. In terms of the security segment, organic was a little bit softer and just kind of looking back to last quarter you guys thought that for the year it would run around that down mid-single digit rate, so second quarter a little bit softer than that. How should we think about the second half organically within the security segment? Is 2Q a better run rate or is the first quarter a better run rate for the business?
Jim Lorry: I would say Mark that the second quarter is probably not the best run rate for the back half of the year, it's most likely a blend of the first half and what we are assuming for the back half of the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Within that piece of the business pricing in total for the company still favorable but slightly less favorable than 1Q. Was the pricing pressure relative to the first quarter within the installed business in security or are you seeing some pricing pressure elsewhere?
Jim Lorry: The pricing pressure within security is definitely on the install business, in particular the national accounts pricing is under a lot of pressure. As our customers just like we look to cut costs they are going after their vendors and clearly when they have leverage, purchasing leverage, they are willing to exert it much more so than in a typical environment. So, we are not seeing dramatic pricing pressure in the core commercial accounts which is good and the margins are holding up well there and we know we are walking from some business in national accounts where we are just not capitulating on price to the extent that some of the other competitors are. We believe strongly in our value proposition and the performance of the business substantiates that and so we are trying to hold our prices at a fairly constant level in that business, even in the national accounts.
John Lundgren: Okay. Mark, this is John, I'll just add onto that so you don't get cut off. It may appear on the surface to be a rather bold statement that we are holding prices particularly in national accounts and not theoretically, in reality losing some business. We are cautiously optimistic and there is a lot of historical precedent to say that much of that business will come back to us when whoever's taken it, regardless of whether it's a large national competitor or a small local competitor, on the national accounts level, it's much more likely to be a larger competitor. When and if, they fail to deliver at the level that we've delivered in the past, you know and it's clear in the industry, our attrition rates are not among the lowest, they are the lowest in commercial security. There is a reason for that and a business that an account that is won on price will can and might well ultimately be lost on service. We'll get it back on our terms at our price that does take some time. We're very patient in that regard, because we think that's the right strategy for a business that's such an important part of our future.
Operator: The next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.
Jeff Saut - Raymond James: Thank you. This is Jeff calling in for Sam. First question, it surrounds the restructuring, you mentioned 35%, but its headcount, of the other 65% of that, is any of that discretionary spend that you would expect to come back faster, if units stabilize?
Don Allan: Jeff, this is Don. We won't expect any of this to come back faster than the previous restructuring programs we've done. We believe that these particular items are very similar items to what we've done before, so with additional cuts around T&E, and other discretionary spend. It's a real question mark for next year, how much comes back. It's really about us as a management team and how we control it and what decisions we make and what we allow to come back. It's really going to be dependent on what our ultimate thoughts are on the end markets and our revenue projections for next year. So, there will be some cost pressures that we talked about before around certain employee benefits that could be $40 to $60 million. It's difficult to really know of the carryover benefit we're getting, how much of that that comes back, as you say, or what pressures we have that offset it because it's really going to be dependent on our decision and what we allow to come back and it's going to be based on our revenue projections.
Jeff Saut - Raymond James: Okay. Second question, the improvement in gross margin, or the change, old guidance to new guidance for gross margin, I assume is mostly mix but my question is the second half degradation in gross margin if you are guiding towards 100 bps or so, is that all related to price? And can you talk about the price versus material inflation relationship and where you see that going in the second half?
Jim Loree:  We actually benefited on a year-over-year basis by about, slightly over 300 basis points from the combination of productivity projects, price and acquisition mix. Some of those aspects will abate as time goes on because in particular, price, the vast majority of our pricing was implemented in the second and third quarter of last year. So when we look at a back half year-over-year analysis, clearly price will not be increasing sequentially at the same rate. That said, inflation is a crapshoot and that's why we have a range because we had modest deflation in this quarter, very modest, but there was a point in the quarter when we thought we were going to have inflation. So, as you know, in the March-April timeframe, commodity prices were spiking, they subsequently abated and it's not clear from here, you know, what commodity prices are going to do. A lot depends on the perception of the economic recovery and when it occurs and what the speculators do and so on in the commodity markets. However, that clearly is the reason that we have a range and what we feel is a relatively conservative range for the gross margin that we indicated.
John Lundgren: This is John. Importantly, it is a sequential decline arithmetically but from, if you will 39.5% to 38.5% the midpoint of the range that Don required, I'll live with that in this environment, if we can continue to achieve it, but you know, arithmetically you are correct and I think that Jim explained the rationale behind it.
Jim Loree: And when you think about the pressure on unit costs that is created by this volume issue that we have relative to the marketplace, that also is a big variable and we're anxiously looking forward to the day when we can actually have some volume to run through our factories and benefit from the absorption of overhead that will create. Now the contribution margin and the gross margin in this company varies by about 10 points and so that's going to really bode well for us when we do have some kind of a resurgence or at least some kind of up-tick, would be a better word than resurgence in volume.
John Lundgren: And then just last point, just to add a little color to the same subject. We've made it very clear working capital is a focus, working capital returns is a focus. It goes without saying, but it's worth for us, but it's worth repeating. We no longer run our factories for liquidations, the mantra is sell one, replenish one is how we think about it. And to Jim's points with the soft volumes, we're not going to simply run product in the inventory, miss our working capital returns, but to the extent in that reduced volume environment, we continue to basically produce to fulfill demand and nothing more that has pressure on margins. So it all contributes, but the objective being to maintain it within 100 basis points of a 163 year record first half performance.
Operator: The next question comes from Nigel Coe from Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning, guys, this is actually [Nicole] asking questions on Nigel's behalf. First of all, if we can just go into a little bit more detail on the price inflation dynamic, if you could quantify that for the current quarter it would be helpful?
Don Allan: This is Don, Nicole. We really don't want to get into that level of detail for various reasons. I think we've been very clear that prices are positive and productivity was as well and mix of security with a little bit of deflation, as Jim just indicated and that's really where we would like to leave it.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then, if you could speak to the head count reductions, how many have you actually taken out so far and then could you provide the mix between US and Europe?
Don Allan: The new set of actions are about 200 headcount, so I don't have the other ones right in front of me. We can certainly get that to organize; it's about 2000 people roughly.
Jim Loree: 200 on top of 2000. The 2200 in total the combination of the three programs.
John Lundgren: This is John that is skewed toward the US; A, 60% of our revenues are in the US and B, as I think everyone on the call realize the costs have been recognized in the charges but in terms of cash flow, there are very rigorous and serious sets of legal and procedural guidelines that one follows in Europe and we understand them very well. We've successfully been through in the past and we're not going to attempt to circumvent or accelerate any of those processes and procedures that are there for a reason. So we will ultimately get where we need to be in Europe, the dialog and the collaboration with the unions and the works councils has been all we could hope for. There is tremendous reality and I think outstanding perspective on what the situation is. They have been skewed in the US, heads that come out later on will be and the cost associated with that, certainly from a cash perspective, will be skewed more towards Europe just due to the time lag.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Kim from Imperial Capital.
Michael Kim - Imperial Capital: Hi, good morning, guys. Just going back to the security segment and specific to the convergent business, you guys talked a little bit about the increase in RMR and speak a little bit about attrition and pricing and where you're seeing in particular areas of either strength or weakness. Thanks.
Don Allan:  Well, I feel like we've pretty much have covered, I am not sure if you caught the first part of the call Michael, but we delved into that in a fair amount of detail. If you want to call offline to Kate afterwards, she can run you through it, okay?
Michael Kim - Imperial Capital: Sure, I apologize.
Jim Loree:  Page 11, on the presentation, Michael, that's more detail than anyone has ever provided on this subject in a call of this nature, so if there is something beyond that that you need, Kate if she is able, will provide that for you offline, if that's okay?
Michael Kim - Imperial Capital: Okay. So, I missed the beginning part of the call earlier.
Jim Loree: I think you'll find that pretty helpful. We did it for a reason and the reason was your question is a valid one, but let's not do it twice.
Michael Kim - Imperial Capital: Okay, sounds good. And then just maybe more in general terms, can you talk a little about the framework for RMR relative to installations, installations obviously have been under pressure from the macro environment and how we should probably think about RMR going forward?
John Lundgren:  Michael, it's the exact same answer. Jim spent five minutes on it. It's on page 11. And why don't you have a look at that and then give Kate a call, but hopefully you will get more than what you need on that explanation.
Jim Loree:  Our hypothesis going into the call was that, that would be a topic that people would want to understand, so we took the proactive step of providing that information in great detail. So, I think you will really get what you need from that when talking to Kate.
Operator: The next question comes from Kenneth Zener, Macquarie Capital.
Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Capital: I wonder if you could just kind of talk about the competitive landscape specifically in tools, given the extreme downturns that we've had, and I think you guys are managing your business very well and at a reasonable leverage. How is it looking relative to the private label competitors that you see, whether they are European or Asian, and how has that impacted the M&A landscape that you see?
John Lundgren: Well, I guess that's two very different questions, Ken. If I can try to dissect them, I will. We have talked about this on previous calls and other than our Stanley associates we certainly value the Stanley brand as our most important asset. What happens in any branded category, and this is both industrial and CDIY, but if you particularly think of the Stanley brand and Bostitch brand, we are number one or two in every category where we compete and that is a very good place to be. There are numerous recessions or periods of economic downturn over the last 30, 40 years where two things happen; private label and even generics as you've suggested grow, and the leading brand growths, and it's the brands in the middle that get squeezed out. Why is that? Obviously people in the middle are trading down to private label, but the customers want and need the leading brand as a reference point, so they can even widen the gap between private label or the retailers brand and the leading, if you will, national brand or the leading premium brand. So the winners, year in, year out, through these periods of economic downturn are the number one brand. Thankfully we're it in almost every category. And private label, and it is at the expense of particularly the numbers three and four brand. How that has impacted the M&A landscape? We've talked over time, there's tremendous, if you will, consolidation opportunity in the industry, but quite frankly there's little or nothing going on and our view is that hasn't affected it at all. Any and all companies, our views are very cautious in terms of protecting their balance sheets and there's been no more or less activity than we've seen in the past. So that's a long way of saying no change.
Jim Loree: I mean our hope would be that the industry would consolidate at some point, the hand tool industry, and that some of these number three and number four brands, owners of these brands would want to consolidate their activities with us. As John said, it's actionability are implied. Actionability is everything when it comes to that and if there is no desire, there is no activity.
Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Capital: Understood. The second question I have, just further clarity on the impressive benefit you guys are getting on the gross margin line. You guys were just talking about in terms of the percentage basis, but the implied 75 million, that's primarily from a more realistic view about your input costs?
Don Allan: No. It's a combination of productivity projects, price and acquisition mix offset and that's over 300 basis points, as I mentioned. Offset by significantly higher unit cost related to lack of absorption in the manufacturing area.
John Lundgren: Yes. Our view, Ken, is we think that something a lot of folks are missing, we can talk about modest deflation and it looks like there maybe some. Our volumes are down 20%. Our actual costs all other things being equal are up dramatically. A 20% volume decline and that much less volume flowing through our factories overwhelms the modest impact of any deflation, which Jim and Don already suggested, we're only beginning to see. So, it's taking a lot of hard work on three other fronts. Our normal productivity funnels, short lead times purchasing, you name it to keep up all the benefits to come from our SFS initiative, it's taken all of that to keep us where we are and input costs are a very, very small piece of any positives we've seen in the past. Quite frankly, a very small piece of our belief that we can maintain within a 100 basis points those margins going forward in the second half of the year.
Operator: The last question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Ray Huang - JPMorgan: This is actually Ray Huang on for Mike. You guys talked about the market share gains in CDIYs, I'm wondering if you could break out or give some more detail on which end markets or channels are getting share and then, if you had any detail on any specific products or initiatives that are driving the gains.
Jim Loree: Well, the end market is defined by the name of the segment, which construction in DIY. There is no particular differentiation there between construction and DIY. I mean the share gains coming in the US at large retailers in particular, one very large retailer, the largest retailer in the world and we've got substantial share gain there. Then in Europe we've a number of smaller customers, when taken in the aggregate representing reasonably significant share gain.
Ray Huang - JPMorgan: Then if you think about CDIY stabilizing in the back half of the year, how we should look at the margins on in that segment, are you kind of thinking in the 10% range for the back half of the year?
Don Allan: We're not going to forecast margins by segment. We never have. I think what's important that Jim Loree mentioned in quite a bit of detail, when he went through that segment is three sequential quarterly increases that we're very encouraged by and that's coming not just from the cost benefit of combining our former Consumer Tools and Storage business the path that's, but also by essentially having a larger combined team to focus on the same end markets and we're seeing, the cost benefits I say are fairly obvious and straightforward. They're easy, but the share gains have come or beginning to come and we think will come in the future, due to the fact that we have the strength and strength, the combined professional organization, a product development process, focusing on the same customers and the same end markets, which was the logic for putting these two businesses together in the first place. So, thus far it has been probably, pick a number three quarters' cost, 25% volume going forward. That's going to be about 50-50, which validates the rationale for combining those businesses in the first place.
Operator: At this time I would like to hand the call back over to Ms. Kate White.
Kate White: Thank you, Jennifer. We wanted to close today by letting you know how you could gain access to members of the Stanley Management Team throughout the remainder of the year. We will be participating in a number of industry conferences as well as hosting an Analyst Day in November at the New York Stock Exchange. We have laid out these locations and dates in slide number 20 in our presentation. This concludes the Stanley Works second quarter 2009 conference call. We thank you for your time today. Again, if you have any questions, please feel free to either email or call me.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator:  Good morning, my name is Molly and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to The Black and Decker First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference to Mark Rothleitner, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.  
Mark Rothleitner:  Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to Black and Decker’s First Quarter Conference Call. On today’s call our Chief Financial Officer Steve Reeves and I will discuss our first quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2009. Our comments should take about 15 minutes and then we will answer your questions. In keeping with SEC requirements I want to advise you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect The Black and Decker Corporation please review the reports we have filed with the SEC including the 8-K filed today. In addition, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of SEC Reg G. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is included on the Corporations website under the Investor Relation section. Now I will turn it over to Steve.
Steve Reeves: Thanks Mark. This morning Black and Decker announced earnings per share of $0.08 for the first quarter or $0.22 excluding restructuring charges. This is slightly better than our guidance despite an economic environment that was even weaker than we anticipated. We have taken a series of aggressive steps to reduce costs, enabling us to remain profitable even in the worst economic downturn we’ve ever seen. Sales decreased 28% including a 5% unfavorable impact from currency translation. In January we gave sales guidance for a decline of approximately 20% in the first quarter, however sales in our European Power Tool business and Fastening segment were well below our estimate. We saw rapid deterioration in Europe and the automotive industry late in 2008 and another step down this quarter. Our pre restructuring operating margins decreased to 3.5% primarily due to lower sales volume. Importantly however, margins were better than the 2% we projected. We stayed disciplined on price which contributed 1% to sales and helped our gross margin. In addition, we reduced SG&A expense by 23% a significant improvement versus last year. While some of this does reflect currency translation we have meaningfully change our fixed cost base over the last six quarters. We also remain well positioned in terms of liquidity and cash flow. As expected, free cash flow as significantly negative due to typical first quarter working capital needs as well as the accounting treatment of currency hedging that we discussed in January. Including cash flows from net investment hedging activities net cash generation was negative at $123 million versus -$71 million in the first quarter of 2008. This decline was driven by lower earnings as the change in working capital and capital expenditures were similar to the prior year. Now let me discuss our business segments. Sales in our worldwide Power Tools and Accessories segment decreased 23% in the quarter. In the US the industrial product group sales decreased approximately 30%. We had anticipated most of this decline based on depressed construction levels and inventory corrections at retail. Order levels were particularly weak in the independent channel and at a large customer. Late in the quarter DEWALT(R) launched the next generation of XRP cordless tools featuring compatible lithium ion and Ni-Cad battery systems. Initial orders for this line came in later than planned as the slowing economy lengthened the process of working through existing inventories. Looking forward however, we believe XRP and other upcoming launches will bolster our leading position in cordless. Following a year of challenging transitions results for the US Consumer Products Group stabilized considerably in the first quarter. Sales decreased mid single-digits, a much narrower decline than in 2008. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we had large December shipments of outdoor product ahead of the spring season. This in turn drove the sales decline for the first quarter. Sales of tools and accessories increased reflecting solid performance for the new Porter-Cable(R) line. In the European Power Tools and Accessories business we had planned for continued sales decline, but did not expect a drop of nearly 30%. Results were weak in all key product lines, but particularly for industrial tools. Commercial activity in some markets was down substantially, especially Eastern Europe which was affected by currency volatility and investment flight.  The slow downs also limited demand for our premium lithium ion products. Other parts of the world which had performed well in 2008, also showed signs of economic slowing this quarter. In Latin America sales were flat as weakening construction activity offset strong consumer product sales, especially in Brazil. Sales were down double-digits in Canada significantly worse than we expected, in part to due to inventory corrections and promotional shifts at retail. The Asia Pacific sales were also down double-digit declines in most countries. Return on sales for the Power Tools and Accessories business decreased 440 basis points to 3.9% this quarter. Roughly half the drop was in gross margin reflecting ongoing component cost inflation, absorption, unfavorable mix, and currency, which more than offset favorable productivity and price. SG&A decreased an impressive 16%, but as sales fell even more deleverage had a negative impact on the segments operating margin. In our Hardware and Home Improvement segment sales decreased 19% for the quarter. Results in this segment continue to reflect declines of roughly 25% to 30% in the new construction channel with smaller decreases at retail.  Lockset sales in the US were down more than 20% at low and mid price points the decline was less than our higher priced SPIRALOCK category. This reflected some consumers trading down as well as a large customer closing its show rooms doors and inventory actions in the channel. The Price Pfister faucet business posted mid teen sales decline due to the ongoing challenge in construction and falling demand at retail. Operating margin for the Hardware and Home Improvement segment decreased 340 basis points to 4% for the quarter. Gross margin and SG&A percentage were both unfavorable reflecting lower sales and production of volumes as well as the carry in of component inflation.  In the Fastening and Assembly Systems segment sales decreased 34%, far worse than we anticipated. Over 60% of the sales in the segment are to the automotive industry which reduced production in the quarter in an attempt to bring finished vehicle inventories in line. Our sales to auto makers were down nearly 40%, slightly less than the drop in production levels.  The remainder of the segment also saw a sharp decline as industrial customers reacted to the global economic slowdown and reduced inventories. Our sales were down across major product lines and geographical regions. The 2008 acquisition of SPIRALOCK contributed 2 points of sales growth for the quarter to the segment. Operating margin for the Fastening segment fell to 1.9% for the quarter. Our management has proactively reduced costs, but could not keep up with the sales decline. Now we will review the financials in a little more detail. Looking at the income statement sales were $1.1 billion for the quarter, a 28% year-on-year decline. Organically volume decreased 24% for the quarter and price added 1%. Currency translation had a negative 5% impact, largely in line with our guidance. Gross margin was 31.7% for the quarter; this was virtually flat to the fourth quarter, but down nearly 300 basis points to last year. As we expected component cost deflation has not worked through the splicing yet to the P&L. The negative year-on-year impact was driven by steel, resins, and the appreciation of the Chinese Renminbi. The mix also remained negative as some of our highest margin product lines and businesses were disproportionately affected by the weak economy. In the first quarter we reduced SG&A by $92 million or 23%. Currency contributed 6 points to this decrease. Expenses were down in every major category and in each segment. While our actions were generating significant results, SG&A increased 180 basis points due to the lower volume. As you can see from the press release corporate adjustments and eliminations is favorable to last year. More than half of this favorability was the result of lower legal and environmental expense including a favorable ruling on certain litigation in the quarter. The balance is comprised of lower incentive accruals, reduced corporate spending, and other miscellaneous items. Absent the legal and environmental favorability our earnings before restructuring would have been within our guidance range. During the quarter we recorded a restructuring charge of $12 million which had a $0.14 impact on EPS. As global economies have weakened we continue to reevaluate the size and structure of our business. Restructuring actions reflected in the first quarter charge include a further workforce reduction of 1,500 positions and should generate annual pre-tax savings of more than $15 million in 2009. Overall our workforce is nearly 20% smaller today than at the end of 2007.  In total our recent restructuring actions generated approximately $15 million of savings in the first quarter and are expected to deliver over $75 million for the full year. Interest expense of $16 million for the quarter was slightly favorable to the prior year and our guidance. In a moment Mark will discuss our recent bond issuance which increases our interest expense going forward. Our effective tax rate was 45% for the quarter, or 36%, excluding the effect of restructuring. This is higher than the 30% rate we expect over time due to a fixed interest component to the expense. Usually this does not affect the rate much, but on a low earnings base it increased the rate significantly this quarter. We did not have any significant resolutions of tax matters or adjustments this quarter.  Now I will turn it over to Mark who will discuss cash flow and liquidity in more detail.
Mark Rothleitner: Thanks Steve. Our balance sheet remains in good shape and we expect cash flow will remain solid despite the challenging environment. As Steve mentioned, net cash generation was negative $123 million for the quarter due to seasonal working capital needs. We expected a number in this ballpark and are still on track to generate cash in excess of earnings for the year.  Inventory decreased 17% year-on-year which we consider good progress in light of the weaker than expected sales. We also reduced capital expenditures roughly 20% and expect a similar trend the rest of the year. Due to negative cash generation in the regular dividend payment net debt increased $149 million during the quarter; however, consistent with our January projection we expect net debt will be down modestly for the full year. Shortly after the end of the quarter we issued $350 million of senior notes due in 2014. Over the past year we have taken steps to shift from short-term to long-term debt, maintaining a conservative position during the financial crisis. The bond offering was a continuation of this strategy. The bond market has been very unpredictable since September, so we took advantage of a favorable opportunity to issue in early April. As a result, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2011 and nearly all of our $1 billion short-term credit facility is available. However, our 2009 interest expense will increase by roughly $18 million versus our previous guidance, almost entirely due to the bonds.  Our past employment priority remains net debt reduction and we continue to look at small bolt on acquisitions. Our share repurchases also remain on hold. Now I will turn it back to Steve to discuss the outlook for the rest of 2009.
Steve Reeves: Thanks Mark. Before I discuss our 2009 outlook, I would like to note that next week, at its scheduled meeting, our board will address our dividend. As we discussed in January, we will evaluate our dividend pay out in relation to our current profitability, cash flow, and general economic environment, and make a decision based on the best long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders. Looking forward to the balance of the year most of the end market factors that caused the weak demand in the first quarter are expected to continue. The housing, non-residential construction, and automotive industries remain depressed. General economic conditions are still poor in Europe and decelerating in other regions.  While most inventory corrections occurred in the first quarter for the Power Tools and the International Fastening businesses, we expect further actions in the second quarter in selected areas. As a result, for the second quarter we expect sales will decrease at a rate similar to the first quarter. This includes approximately 7 points of unfavorable currency as we comp against last years weakening dollar. The percentage declines should then narrow somewhat, particularly in the fourth quarter, as we anniversary the step change in the global economy. For the year we expect a sales decline of approximately 20% including 5 points of unfavorable currency.  As always, we are introducing great new products, such as the updated XRP cordless and additional tools in the Porter-Cable line. However, we also recognize that the weak economy limits the upside from these launches. On the cost side deleveraging will continue to pressure our margins, component costs will remain unfavorable next quarter, and due to lower volumes the benefit of commodity deflation will be slower to work through the supply chain. The first quarter restructuring action should result in at least $15 million of additional savings for the year. In addition, our management team is doing a good job of controlling discretionary spending, as evidenced by the progress on SG&A this quarter, an the salary and benefit actions previously disclosed will further mitigate the lower revenue forecast. Pricing has held up a little better than we expected and based on this performance, we believe that price will positive for the full year. As a result of these developments, we still expect margins about 5% for the year, despite the volume pressure. We now expect interest expense will increase to roughly $91 million for the year, including the incremental costs related to the bond issuance. We are still assuming a full year tax rate of 30%.  Our diluted share count assumption has come down slightly to around $50.5 million shares due to the lower stock price.  Also note that last week we filed an 8-K to reflect the new accounting standard for the calculation of earnings per share. In total, we now expect diluted EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.90 for the full year, excluding restructuring charges. The decrease from our previous guidance, midpoint, is $0.30, roughly $0.21 of which relates to the interest expense. The remainder reflects lower sales volume largely offset by cost reductions and the small first quarter out performance.  In the second quarter we expect diluted EPS in the range of $0.35 to $0.45. With respect to cash flow we now believe we have identified a further $15 million reduction in capital spending for the year. Additionally, while we have largely held inventory turns through the decline, we anticipate further reducing our inventory in the second quarter. While pressuring the P&L through under absorption in the first half, this will allow us to match production to demand in the back half and generate incremental cash from working capital for the full year.  In summary, Black and Decker has met its key objectives in a difficult environment this quarter and is taking the necessary steps to continue weathering the storm. We delivered positive EPS in a challenging demand environment. We continue to reduce SG&A expense without sacrificing our innovation capabilities, or long-term growth prospects. We significantly reduced inventory and capital expenditures. We remained on track to generate cash in excess of earnings for the year, and we maintained a conservative financing strategy issuing bonds after quarter end to further strengthen our liquidity position. I believe that Black and Decker has the best people in the industry to execute our strategy and drive the Company’s long-term success. We appreciate the efforts and the sacrifices our associates are making, and we remain confident that these will create value for the Company and its stockholders.  That concludes my prepared remarks. Now I will turn it back to the operator and we will answer your questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Goldberg with UBS.
Susan - UBS: Good morning it is actually Susan for David. I just want to know if you can discuss what you’re seeing in terms of the health of some of your smaller independent retailers. It seems like a fair amount of the decline that you’ve seen this quarter came from some changes there. I’m just wondering what you’re seeing overall. 
Steve Reeves: Sure well you know some of our independent customers are clearly hurting with this economic downturn. We work with them to manage their credit limits appropriately. We have not seen any significant bankruptcies or anything along those lines in the independent channel, but we are cautious and monitoring that situation closely.
Susan - UBS: Okay and so should you kind of see more of a shift towards the big box retailers, what do you think the impact could be in terms of maybe some of the pricing. I know you expect pricing to be slightly positive for this year, but how is that taking into account the kind of sale mix that you’re seeing?
Steve Reeves: If you question is relative to price, we have, as we indicated previously toward the end of last year, worked through price increases in most of our businesses on a number of our lines and those are holding up through this year. I think outside the US, with the currency situation the way it is, there is an opportunity for currency reasons to be able to take price in some markets going forward through the rest of this year. I think that’s factored into the mix shift that you’re referring to.
Susan - UBS: Okay and then just one more question. In terms of the lead times, it seems like your lead times might be getting a little bit longer given the fact that things are slowing so dramatically. Do you expect any changes in your working capital trends as we go through the year?
Steve Reeves: As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our intention is to take a significant reduction in our inventories in the second quarter to get them in line with the demand environments we see going forward. So, I would say that you would expect to see some further production cuts in the second quarter, inventory coming out, payable will stay down with that. Then as we match production to sell out in the back half of the year you should see the payable trend come back and capture the cash in the current year.
Susan - UBS: Okay thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan : I would like to get a little better sense of your expectations for component costs, which has been pretty volatile over the last 12 months. You mentioned that you expect the component costs to be higher year-over-year in Q2. Could you just give us an update in terms of what you laid out last quarter for the full year, positive or negative, on an overall basis, and if your expectations for the back half have changed at all as part of your updated guidance.
Steve Reeves: Not materially. I think we guided that inflation would be negative for the full year, which is still our expectation. That it would be more negative in the front half as we carried in from current inflation from last year and as it takes a period for some of our contracts to reset. That is still true. As the year progressed you would start to see the benefits of the deflation that has been occurring since the economic slow down. With lower volumes it will take a little longer to get that to work through the supply chain as we have less volume to push through. But, not a material change relative to the full year outlook.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan :  Just to kind of reiterate, if I could get a little bit better feel for the inventory corrections. Then maybe that can tie into my third question which is pricing and your outlook for pricing. With demand where it is and certainly the big retailers continue to be very aggressive on inventory levels, as you have noted, can you reconcile that with your outlook for still positive price? I know you just kind of gave some comments, but particularly in the US. You also noted that the reception might be more muted on some of your new products because of just where we are in the demand cycle. It seems like there is this conflict in terms of very weak demand and perhaps, as you also mentioned, weak demand that is resulting in a negative mix shift. How are you able to reconcile that with your outlook for pricing, not to get on the margin worse from current levels?
Steve Reeves: Sure, that was a long question. I will take a stab at answering it and if I miss something let me know. Our pricing forecast is not a function of being able to take price in the US going forward. I think it’s, as I mentioned, us holding onto the price that we negotiated last year. As you see a shift down in price points, which occurs in some of our categories, buyers are shifting down and at this point in time we have, say from a DEWALT we can shift down to Porter-Cable and Black and Decker. I don’t know that that is in our interest and so I chased the DEWALT pricing down to get that user as he’s stepping down to a different value proposition.
Mark Rothleitner: And a lot of the pricing, Mike, is not in the United States. We’ve got different abilities and it’s more of a rifle shot. So really what we are looking at is the performance in the quarter was a little bit better, so we expect that the performance on the full year, from a pricing perspective, will continue to be a little bit better than our original estimate. But, this is not a big change, this is a very modest change in our outlook to outlook.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan :  Can you comment on your views of whether or not you held gain, or lost share, in your DEWALT line in the first quarter?
Steve Reeves: It’s really hard to do share count on a quarter-over-quarter basis. There is an awful lot of noise in that. I think in our last call we indicated that we were losing some share on the cordless side of DEWALT as the market shifted to lithium and I think that trend has continued.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan :  Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank Securities. 
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities : The first thing I wanted to ask you about was the Fastening and Assembly business. The exposure, as you mentioned, substantially to the automotive industry. The automotive industry has been suffering for a while. Sales had held up a little bit better there, I think partly because of an international mix issue. I’m just trying to understand the sensitivity to the industry and why sales would have just fallen off a cliff there. In particular I was looking to understand how much this has to do with the distress at the US automakers; along those lines, if it is related to a potential bankruptcy or more than one bankruptcy how would that affect it further going forward?
Steve Reeves: I think, as you look back over time our Fastening business, the majority of it, is outside the US. I think you would have seen the Asian and the European automakers even having been performing reasonably well, you are right that the automotive industry has been depressed for some amount of time. What I feel we saw in the first quarter was that as a global statement the automotive companies slowed down because their finished goods inventories had built up. So, you saw the Asian and the European automakers take production out to get their inventories back in line with historical trends. I think that occurred largely in the first quarter, and so we should be pacing with sales going forward. I think in the US, while there was an attempt to get their inventories in line, I don’t think, at least the domestic aspects of the US automotive market did not achieve that goal, and there is still some substantial overhang in inventory in North America. But, I think that as you look at the bigger part of our business, which is outside of the US, their inventories are back largely in line with where they want them to be. If in fact we lose GM and Chrysler through this downturn people will still buy the same number of cars and so we supply to virtually the entire industry, so the exact effect will be dependant upon the individual company that picks up the sales ultimately, because we will have different penetrations in different places, but people will still buy the same number of cars, even if those two go bankrupt.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities : That’s very helpful. The next question I wanted to ask was kind of a bigger picture question. The last couple of years has just seen one shoe drop after the other, housing, non-residential, your sales in Europe, now fastening and assembly. So, what is left that could go wrong here? As I look across your sales Latin America still seems to be holding up a little bit better than elsewhere, but I guess, what else is there beyond that that could fall apart here in the coming quarters?
Steve Reeves:  You are right; it has been a challenging environment. If you were to look at the risks, it is how far down is industrial and commercial construction going to go? I mean it is off significantly. When will that rebound? All of the sectors, as you pointed out, are down, and have gone through some cataclysmic changes, so I don’t think there are any particular areas that have been left untouched by the economic downturn.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities : The debt rising, I’m just trying to understand the rationale here. You have used maybe $200 or $300 million out of your billion capacity. Nowhere close to the full capacity. You are only pushing out your maturity by, I think, two years here, because I think your revolver expired in 2012, assuming it couldn’t be renewed or extended, and it is coming at a pretty significant cost. I was just wondering, I understand your desire to be conservative, but it seems like a pretty high cost to pay for the extension of liquidity you’re getting.
Steve Reeves: Well, hopefully everything turns around and the worlds good and maybe it will prove to be a mistake, but I think with the uncertainty in the marketplace right now and the rating changes that we incurred in the first quarter, which limited our ability to access commercial paper, it is prudent to lock in extra liquidity at this point in time. 
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities : Okay, thanks a lot.  
Operator:  Your next question comes from Daniel Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. 
Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse : I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about pricing volumes. You talked about the price being better than you expected this quarter. It seems as though you are favoring price over volume. As you talked about the second half of the year expecting some recovery based on the easier comparisons there, should we expect substantially more use of discounts there should the sales not recover as expected?
Steve Reeves: I think you only want us to use price if we’re really going to drive volume with it. I think we’ve incurred a fair amount of commodity costs and we’re going to try and hold onto the pricing that we’ve gotten, would be my observation as we go forward. We will deal with each intentional action on a case-by-case basis and where the right cost benefit is. But, our expectation now is that we will not. 
Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse : I am also wondering, you talked about the favorable legal environments to expenses. How material was that this quarter?
Steve Reeves: The favorable legal environment was a little over $6 million.
Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse : Great, thanks very much. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Capital.
Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities: I was wondering if you could give us a little feel for the quarter. When you guys reported at the end of January you were looking for down 20% for the quarter. It came in at about down 27%, 28%. It seems that the quarter has deteriorated substantially, probably 30% declines in those overall in the last two months. Can you talk about the trends that you saw, and given that significant weakness, how you were able to offset? I would like a little more detail, really, on the operating leverage that’s embedded in the business given that it deteriorated so significantly.
Steve Reeves: I think as we saw the volume not coming back and it’s hard to get into a month by month comparison, but we took the effort to do this initial restructuring charge to try and get our costs in line both on the manufacturing side as well as in SG&A and just to clamp down on all discretionary spending. As we noted, we asked our employees to take a scaled pay cut for the balance of the year as well. It’s really not a lot more complicated than that. Those are the broad actions we took.
Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities: Okay so you’re saying that when you guys were expecting 20%, did it deteriorate, because that was already one month into the quarter. 
Steve Reeves: Yes it did. I think as we were providing our guidance for the first quarter back in January, and January is a very small month and it is hard to draw a lot of conclusions from that month. But, we were forecasting, say on the Fastening side, a much different automotive production level and the production just did not come back as fast as we had anticipated it would. And we saw further deterioration in Europe than what we were expecting. 
Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities: Okay so focusing on Europe where that went down largely on the professional side. Could you give us just a feel for how much of that split between the pro versus the consumer in terms of exposure to that market on a dollar basis, as well a the margins. I think in the past you guys have said it’s been fairly equal between the pro and consumer over in Europe. If you could update us where that is in terms of the margin spread between those businesses. 
Steve Reeves: The revenue split is roughly equal. We have not historically provided profitability detail at that level and I’m not going to at this point in time. In total we are deleveraging in Europe as the sales drop there. It is a reasonably high fixed cost business, so our margins are off relative to what they have historically been.
Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities: But, you are saying it really was the pro that fell, not as much as the consumer. I mean was it kind of half the magnitude?
Steve Reeves: They were both down. Pro was down substantially more than the consumer business was. I suspect related to the commercial construction.
Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities: Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. 
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James : Can you talk about specifically in PTA and HHI what sell through was in terms of could you quantify what the rationalization efforts of the retailers taking out their inventories might have contributed?
Steve Reeves:  Sure. I think in PT&A we saw kind of mid-teens sell through declines and in HHI, I am trying to remember off the top of my head here, I think it was down slightly less than that is my recollection.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James : When you refer to pricing expecting to be positive for the year, is that ASP which would include mix, or is that like for like pricing that you’re referring to?
Steve Reeves: Like for like.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James : Like for like pricing, so would mix be a detriment, would it be a favorable all in including mix within mix? How should we look at mix?
Steve Reeves: Well mix is in some ways it’s all other, but as we move between price points, profitability changes not always in the way you’d expect. So, I think it is our current forecast that we’re going to mix down on profitability perspective based on what where we think the sales are going to occur.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James : Should we factor that in from a modeling standpoint or is it just real, real modest, or mild expectations?
Steve Reeves: It is a very modest expectation, so I wouldn’t consider it to be material at all. 
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James : Okay and as it relates to the definition of your debt covenants should we back out the favorable ruling and also the restructuring expenses from your EBITDA when we’re calculating the fund of that to EBITDA ratio?
Mark Rothleitner: Generally we would not adjust for sort of normal C&A adjustments, favorable or unfavorable items. Obviously the environmental charge, the large one that we took back in the fourth quarter of 2007, we did adjust for, but no, the normal quarterly changes in legal and in environmental we would not adjust for. We would adjust for the restructuring. 
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James : So we would back the restructuring out? So, the EBITDA would include the $12 million or would not include the $12 million?
Mark Rothleitner: EBITDA would not include the $12 million charge or we would add it back.
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James : I got it, but then it does include the $6 million from the favorable ruling?
Mark Rothleitner: It is included in NOI and that is all the other costs, positive and negative are included. That is neither large enough nor unusual. We get a lot of settlements through out the year on that kind of stuff. The one we did carve out was the large environmental one a year and change ago.  
Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James :  All right, thank you very much gentlemen.
Operator:  Your next question comes from David Macgregor with Longbow Research. 
David Macgregor - Longbow Research : Just looking at your guidance of $150 to $190, you’ve got revenue guidance of down 20 including -5 on the currency. I was just wondering, it was quite a range at the EPS line given a 20% forecast down at the top line. How much variability is there in that 20% top line guidance? Also, maybe to the extent that there isn’t as much variability in your thought there, can you talk about the opportunity to get costs down further as an earnings driver over and above the $75 million restructuring benefits?
Steve Reeves: Sure. It’s a very difficult forecasting environment, so I don’t think we mean it to be precise. I think what we’ve tried to capture is the current run rates that we’re seeing and provide an allowance for where we think things are going to climb further in coming up with that 20%. It is not a precise calculation by any means, so there will be variability in that. We are working on what our contingency plans are relative to any further step down in demand that’s significant. As you can imagine this far into a cost cutting initiative, it gets harder and harder as we go along, but there is always opportunity and we are working through what leverage we might pull, if in fact we do see a further deterioration in the top line. 
David Macgregor - Longbow Research : Are we talking about fixed costs primarily in that contingency plan?
Steve Reeves: Depends what you mean by fixed costs, but yes. Generally speaking, yes.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research : You mentioned last quarter you got some hedges coming off here and that you were expecting some relief in the second half from that. At that time copper was $150, now it’s $210 it is up 40% and a number of other commodities have started to move as well. I’m just wondering if maybe that opportunity on the variable cost side is less than what you though it might be. I guess I’m just trying to size up what the cost reduction opportunity might be from this point forward beyond the $75 million.
Steve Reeves: We’re still working through our plans. I couldn’t give you another number. We will react as we see demand tail off as we have through out this downturn. 
Mark Rothleitner: Yes, I mean you have seen us, David, take a number of actions through out the last six quarters. So, you can appreciate that we continue to look at what costs we might be able to eliminate if things do not hit the guidance or the expectations that we have. So, we certainly do not want to telegraph what those items are, but certainly we’ve got to look at contingency plans if we don’t achieve the top line numbers that we have now built in, the new reduced top line numbers that we have built into the guidance.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research : Okay good. My second question is just on the Power Tool business. You mentioned your consolidated pricing was, I think, up 1%. Is there any chance you could give us a little more feel for what it might have been just in the PT&A?
Steve Reeves: No, I don’t want to split it out in that level of detail.
David Macgregor - Longbow Research :

Operator:  Your next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman and Associates 
Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates : My first question just has to do with the sales guidance. I appreciate that you said it is on a specific target and I understand the variability there, but when you think about the first half of the year versus the second half of the year, it sounded based on the financing decisions you guys made to that markets that you appreciate the significant amount of uncertainty in the marketplace and are being cautious there. But, the guidance would imply that you’re going to see significantly less negative results in the back half of the year.  I was hoping that maybe you could just talk through some of the bigger level of assumptions by end channel on where you could see things get at least less negative as we move into the second half.
Steve Reeves: Sure. I think the biggest change as you look at it on a year-over-year comparison is the comp to the step down that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. We’re still calling the fourth quarter down, but not at the same level of decline often already reduced number. Additionally you, especially when you get to the fourth quarter, you start to anniversary the significant strengthening of the dollar that we saw last September. So currency, once you get out to the fourth quarter, is flat to maybe just slightly negative. I think it is more of a comparison issue. We are not seeing signs of recovery in the business at this point in time.
Mark Rothleitner: It is just easier comps as the quarters roll by.
Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates : Okay so fundamentally you see the last couple quarters of the year kind of similar to what, at least the current quarter, is looking like for Q2.
Steve Reeves: Yes there was some inventory adjustments that are occurring in the first quarter, probably will spill over into the second quarter here. But, for all material purposes it is a comp issue that you’re seeing there. 
Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates : Okay and then that leads into my second question on the inventory front, kind of two parts. First you mentioned bringing down production second quarter. Could you talk about which segments you are seeing that primarily in where we will see under absorption? Then kind of similarly, the revenue declines in Europe sounded like they were certainly more than expected and quite large, obviously, on the pro side. Are you guys seeing any inventory problems there?
Mark Rothleitner: Do you mean with respect to our inventory? We are going to bring production down actually in all three of the segments. It is probably most significant in the Power Tool business, but we have plans in place and we’ll execute that and then we will take the absorption medicine here in the second quarter and hopefully match reduction with sell out as we go through the balance of the year. 
Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates : As it relates to the [inaudible] inventory is there any more or less build there relative to the domestic?
Mark Rothleitner: No, it is pretty similar.
Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates :  Then my last question, I would appreciate as much help as you can give me here. As we think about the SG&A number year-over-year I guess it was down somewhere around $90 million. Can you talk through how much of that would be variable and then of the fixed reductions kind of the key components outside of salaries or payroll reductions?
Mark Rothleitner: We reduced spending virtually everywhere. We had the restructuring benefits that we’ve undertaken over the course of the last year as well as, well actually our salary reductions really don’t take affect until the second quarter, but it is predominantly the restructuring actions taken through out the course of 2008 as well as just a clamp down on discretionary spending through the quarter which will carry over through the year.
Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates : Of that discretionary side, how much of that would relate to things that would be product related, whether it’s advertising, R&D, marketing.
Mark Rothleitner: We have cut back on promotion and marketing. What we have left intact largely is our R&D, our new product development activities have largely been untouched through these restructuring actions as we work through.
Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates : Is there a rough number you could give me, as far as a reduction, how much of that would be a fixed reduction?
Mark Rothleitner: Do you mean in terms of the decline? Obviously transportation would have been largely volume driven. There may be some other distribution expenses that would be largely volume driven, but most of the other expenses are probably, except for perhaps some element of compensation, would be fixed costs.
Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates : All right, thanks a lot guys.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.  
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company : First of all, in reducing the sales outlook by about 10% and the earnings outlook is not really that much different than your original guidance, excluding the interest expense, perhaps $0.10 difference. It doesn’t seem like the detrimental margin is much up. Could you just talk a little bit more through how such a significant reduction in sales is not translated into that much on the bottom line?
Steve Reeves: Sure. I think if you think about it you will split the sale take down in two parts. There is the organic take down, which you would expect. Historically we’ve seen kind of a 25% to 35% read through on that, which is not inconsistent with what we’re expecting. And you have a currency take down, which typically is not dragged with it much in the way of earnings and it is not dragging much with it this time either. So if you bifurcate the sale take down into those components, we are able to offset that with the incremental restructuring actions, the other personnel actions that we’ve spoken to, as well as other non-employee related SG&A actions as we go through. Then you have the slight over drive that we had in the first quarter is different, the main components along with the favorable pricing that we spoke to earlier. 
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company : Within the expense reductions that you’re taking here, when sales turn around will you have to reinvest incrementally, or are there things that you pulled out that you clearly have to put money back into on the way up or will you be able to sustain this cost structure and allow the margins and the up side to flow through it at a pretty rapid pace?
Steve Reeves: I think in terms of the cost reduction activities, I think if we saw a material up turn in the business we certainly would think about reinstating salaries. But, in terms of the actual head count actions that we’ve taken, it is probably more on the permanent side that we won’t be adding back positions and you should see pretty good operating leverage on this business when the economy turns around and we start to get some sales growth. 
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company : It appears that the home centers have chosen to promote some of the categories a bit more than power tools, at least relative to a year ago. Is there any influence on what’s going on with pricing in your business related to how the home centers are behaving differently with your category?
Steve Reeves: No not particularly. You are right that the promotion activity is down in certain places relative to where they were last year. But, that is not a particularly big part of the pricing activity.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company : Someone asked you earlier about market share and power tools and I know it’s not a perfect science of how you’re doing. But, at what point and for what reason do you think you will be able to get back to holding or improving your market share in the power tool business?
Steve Reeves: Generally in most categories we are holding our share and doing reasonably well. I think our particular issue is around the cordless and the chemistry transition and our product road is certainly focused on addressing that and you will see us continue to evolve our lithium platform and our new product launches as we go out of 2009 and into 2010.
Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company : Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. : If we look at the down 20% that you’re looking at, can you maybe give us a sense as to back half of the year for US based businesses versus Europe? It sounds like that European Power Tools business, especially in the eastern parts of the country, could be suffering some pretty significant declines even going through the back half of this year and probably into 2010. So I would appreciate some color on how you think about geographic guidance relative to that down 20%.
Steve Reeves: I think that if you stick specifically to the Power Tool business, I think our outlook on Europe is probably a little worse than the total corporation. Our expectation would be that the automotive business in Europe will recover faster than the US business will. So, it is really a function of which segment you’re speaking to. I think Eastern Europe’s problems will be with us for quite awhile there. They are most acute in the far eastern part of Russia and Ukraine and the availability of credit in those markets is very limited and it’s difficult to see how that is going to change.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. : Okay and then competitively the share conversations we have been having. Is it the same case in Europe as well?
Steve Reeves: Yes, it would be.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. : Okay great and then just to tie up the cash flow forecast a bit. CapEx around 80ish is my read right on that?
Steve Reeves: Yes, 80, 85, in that range.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. : Okay and then I just want to make sure I’m clear on this, because we’ve talked about it in the past, but in terms of the hedging, the net cash impact for the year would be around neutral. Is that the right way to think continue to think about that?
Mark Rothleitner: Yes, neutral, maybe slightly positive. It depends obviously on where rates go from here, but it could be a slight positive for us.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. : Okay, then on materials costs, I may have missed this, but in the K, I think you were talking about a number of around $50 million of impact for the year. Is it still the same sort of ballpark?
Steve Reeves: Yes. There is really no material change in our expectations there.
Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. : Okay, great. Thank you very much for your help. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Seth Weber with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. 
Seth Weber - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch : If we are looking at another 30% decline in the fastening business, do you think that that business stays profitable through out each quarter for the year?
Steve Reeves: Do you mean another 30% oh top of where we are now?
Seth Weber - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch : No, I mean another year-over-year 30% decline.
Steve Reeves: I think that yes, I do. I think that that is probably a pessimistic look, but I do believe it will be profitable even at that level. 
Mark Rothleitner: They’ve taken a lot of costs out there as well. 
Seth Weber - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch : Okay and just kind of a housekeeping issue. Is there a number that we should think about for the corporate expense for the full year including the first quarter number?
Steve Reeves: I think for each of the quarters going out you should think about $16 million a quarter for quarters two through three.
Seth Weber - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch : Okay and then have you quantified what your debt reduction number target for the year is?
Mark Rothleitner: No we haven’t. We have just said modestly and depending on where you are from an earnings perspective and we did say we would expect net cash generation to be in excess of earnings. So you can kind of back into it based on our guidance. But, we do expect a modest reduction.
Seth Weber - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch : I got it. Okay, thanks very much.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Tony Fiore with Silvercrest Asset Management
Tony Fiore - Silvercrest Asset Management: With respect to the change in payables during the quarter, a pretty big use of cash flow. I understand lower production levels were a factor. I am wondering if you saw, or if you are seeing any sort of structural changes from your suppliers in terms of them trying to shorten payment terms?
Steve Reeves: No. I mean we obviously monitor the supply base for key suppliers that are struggling, and we have some that kind of cross over with the automotive industry. We will, on occasion, accelerate payment in specific circumstances, but that is not a broad or a particularly significant factor. What you are seeing there is really the function of taking production down.
Tony Fiore - Silvercrest Asset Management: Okay and I may have missed this, but as you look out over the full year do you expect working capital to be a source or use of cash?
Steve Reeves: It will be a source of cash.
Tony Fiore - Silvercrest Asset Management: Okay, thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan : The bolt on, you had mentioned, it was one of your last prepared remarks that you continued to look at small bolt ons. I was wondering if you could give us any more color on that or granularity with regards to which segments you’re looking at more than others. Also if one of those segments, I believe would continue to be the PT&A, if there are specific product categories that you’re more interested in that perhaps you don’t have a presence in right now.
Steve Reeves: We are still continuing to look at small bolt ons. I think that there are and will become more compelling valuations out there as time goes on. I really don’t want to telegraph specifically where we’re looking at this point.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan : All right. But, would it be safe to say that you are not necessarily expecting to pick up an activity over the next couple of quarters?
Steve Reeves: I’m not sure what you mean. I think we continually look at things, as valuations become extraordinarily attractive we will continue to look at part of the stuff. I don’t envision a more intense search though, if that is your question.
Mark Rothleitner: But some additional things may be able to come across the goal line given valuations, Mike.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan : Right, absolutely. I would just like a couple of numbers. The US business, you had mentioned earlier that you estimated that the sell through for PT&A and I would think you’re talking about the US sell through down in the mid teens. You gave us US Industrial down 30, US consumer down mid single-digit, but I don’t have the exact revenue split. Can you just give us what the overall US business was down revenue wise for your own business?
Mark Rothleitner: Do you mean the total US? We try and give you some color on that from a pro and consumer perspective, Mike, as opposed to kind of consolidating it into a number.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan : Yes and I am just trying to get the apples to apples. If you’re saying that sell through is down mid teens. [Interposing]
Steve Reeves: Sell through was down less than sell in.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan : Right, so I am just trying to gauge if that was a 3% difference, a 5% difference?
Steve Reeves: When we give you sell through information it is also not on the entirety of the population. It is really difficult to pin that down that precisely.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan : Okay. Just corporate expense, you expected $16 million per quarter for the next three quarters, but if you add back the $6 million of environmental, legal, that gets you to a $10 to $11 million number, which is roughly in line at the quarterly rate that you were doing in 3Q08 and 4Q08. Am I missing something there in terms of why it would necessarily be higher than that?
Steve Reeves: Well I think it has fluctuated pretty greatly over time. I think in addition to the legal, environmental, there was some other reserve movements in there that aren’t of a recurring nature, so, ergo the $16 million run rate; $16 is actually I think reasonably similar to where we’ve been in my recollection over time and that’s kind of the a little higher corporate pension expense offset by some favorability on spending; relative to thinking about it to the last year.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan : All right thank you.
Operator:  There are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks?
Steve Reeves: No. Thank you for your interest in Black and Decker and we will be available to answer questions through out the day.
Operator:  Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call.

===== 2008 Q4  (2009-01-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Jennifer and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I’d like to welcome everyone to Stanley Works fourth quarter 2008 results conference call. (Operator Instructions) And now I’d like to turn the call over to Miss White. You may begin your conference.
Kate White: Thank you very much Jennifer. Good morning everyone. My name is Kate White, Director of Investor Relations for The Stanley Works. Thank you all very much for joining us on the call this morning. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, Stanley’s Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, Stanley’s Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Stanley’s Vice President and CFO. I would like to point out that our fourth quarter earnings release, which was issued this morning, and a presentation supplementing today’s call which we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website which is www.stanleyworks.com. This morning Jim, John and Don will review Stanley’s fourth quarter and full year 2008 results and various other topic matters, followed by a Q&A session. The entire call is expected to last approximately one hour and a replay of the call will be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and access code are in our press release which again is on our website. And as always, please feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions after today’s call at 860-827-3833 or Corbin Walburger at 860-827-3937. We will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such calls are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as they involve in risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today, and we direct you to the cautionary statements in Form 8-K which we have filed with today’s press release. With that I will now turn it over to our CEO, John.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks Kate. Good morning everybody. Thanks for listening, phoning in. Let me start with just I think what we spent a lot of time talking about internally. I know you’re interested in just an overview of the state of Stanley, as well as some fourth quarter and annual highlights. Our fourth quarter earnings results were in line with previously communicated estimates. You will recall we had a prerelease on December 11, 2008. Those results were $0.66 in the fourth quarter ’08 translating to $3.41 for the year, excluding the fourth quarter restructuring charge which we communicated in our December 11 release and that Don Allan will talk a little bit more about later this morning. It was a very good story in terms of cash flow. Free cash flow of $419 million and that’s despite an unplanned and unanticipated increase in capital spending of about $25 million due to the cancellation of several previously existing lease arrangements. Working capital turns again a good story and a great source of cash increased by 0.6 of a turn to 5.9 despite the unprecedented volume decline that we experienced during the fourth quarter. And Jim’s going to talk about some of the sources both of cash as well as the programs driving the improved turns. It was particularly encouraging in the fourth quarter, the improvement in turns. Price realization continues to be encouraging as we virtually offset the overwhelming majority of our inflation headwinds. For the last two years we’ve averaged about 85% and I have a slide that will give you a little more granularity on that, but we’re making a lot of progress via our pricing center of excellence. The high point certainly for us in the quarter was the performance and for the year was the performance of our convergent Security Solutions business. Revenues grew 21% for the year, 32% for the quarter and operating margin expanded significantly. And again Jim will get into some more detail when we talk about the segments and give you a little bit more granularity on what’s taking place inside our Security segment. And finally, the Security segment currently makes up the largest portion or made up the largest portion of our fourth quarter sales at 38% as our portfolio transition proceeds and Security thus far has been less adversely affected by the macroeconomic conditions. Moving on to a closer look at revenues, revenues of $1.86 billion were down 5% from fourth quarter ’07. As you know there’s not a lot of seasonality in this family business, and the primary factor contributing to the revenue decline was the 10% volume decline as you see on the bottom left. And importantly that followed a 7% unit volume decline in the third quarter, and the 10% Don will talk to you a little bit more later on. That’s not inconsistent with the outlook for the first half of the year where we’re looking at or assuming 12% of volume decline for the foreseeable future. Price was a good story, as we realized a 4% net price increase year-on-year resulting in a 6% decline in organic revenues. Currency was a negative, as the dollar strengthened against the euro, the British pound as well as the Australian and Canadian dollars, those four currencies making up the overwhelming majority of our foreign currency exposure. And acquisitions primarily and securities, secondarily in our Engineered Solutions business, contributed about 6% to our top line. So the net result is a 5% decline in revenue, with a 10% unit volume decline. Looking briefly at the segments, as I suggested Security performed well. The CDIY business was off 16% in total, 10% of which was organic. And Industrial was off 10%, 9 of which was organic. Moving on to margin, we were pleased with our ability to hold gross margin rate for the year despite the decline in volume. You see gross margin holding steady at 37.8% as a result of a business mix towards the higher margin portfolio, as well as the realization of many of the planned costs synergies from recent acquisition. You see that operating margin did decline 140 basis points. And the difference between flat gross margin performance and the 140 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the volume decline, which of course was the catalyst for our announced fourth quarter initiatives. Looking at pricing, I alluded to in the highlights you see at the top a history of our recovery of all our inflation, 81% in 2005, a 45% in 2006 although it was against the lower base, but then 83 and 88% the last two years. We’ve talked about this on earlier calls, but several years ago we established a corporate pricing center of excellence which is really gaining traction. That has evolved in addition to the corporate center with a subset of pricing center of excellence or expert attached to each major business unit, and that’s really starting to gain some traction. So we’re pleased with our ability to thus far, at least the last two years, compensate for the overwhelming majority of materials inflation that we’ve received and we anticipate that to continue going forward. Looking quickly at inflation, because it’s moving very quickly and there’s tremendous volatility, on the left hand side it’s clear commodity prices have declined significantly in recent months, yet we’ve still absorbed a tremendous amount of inflation. The materials inflation accounts for 60 to 75% of Stanley’s [cogs] inflation, depending on the quarter. And then depending on spot prices, 50 to 75% of Stanley’s material inflation is normally steel. So you see the quarterly walk of materials inflation and all of our cost of goods inflation on the left hand side, where we’re continuing to absorb in excess of $40 million a quarter. Looking at the right, because steel is the single most prominent element in our cogs inflation, you see first quarter ’08 Stanley paid on average $660 for steel. In the fourth quarter that was up to $940, with the average for the year being $826. And that’s the average that was included in the chart on the previous page. Looking forward into the first quarter, we’re anticipating an average cost in our P&L of about $790 a ton. That of course is above the current spot price, but I think – and it creates $130 a ton headwind for us in the first quarter. And I think it’s important to note we did a good job throughout the year delaying some of these increases three to six months. And we do have steel in inventory and that we’ve purchased in the fourth quarter and contractually even into the first quarter at higher prices. And we’ll see some of the deflation that we’ve talked about in previous calls and the anticipated deflation starting to show up in our P&L midway through the second quarter. So on a year-on-year basis, inflation will be a reality in early ’09 and of course the jury’s still out, but Don’s guidance talks a little bit about how we’ve accounted for that in our P&L. Let me now turn it over to Jim Loree, who’s going to take us through the segments and then we’ll go on to Don Allan.
James M. Loree: Thank you John. We were very pleased with how the Security segment performed during the quarter. We started building this business back in 2002 in order to diversify our revenue base and to provide a long term source of growth. And in the quarter we certainly accomplished both of those objectives. As you can see, revenues were up 14%. It’s now at a run rate of about a $1.6 billion annual revenue business. Segment profit was up 28% to $75 million and the segment profit rate surged to 18.4%. A lot of this was driven by the convergent – the convergent Security Solutions business, also known as our Electronic Security business which is installation and monitoring electronic security systems. We had two major acquisitions during the year, Sonitrol and GDP and we also enjoyed the benefits of the reverse integration of our United States Systems integration business into the HSM business model, really reaping the synergies that we expected when we did that acquisition. Great story and kudos to [Brett Bontrigger] and his management team for excellent execution in this area. Mechanical Access had a solid quarter under the circumstances. They had to deal with a continued loss of the Home Depot hardware business, which has now finally anniversaried, and they did really well offsetting their volume declines with both price and productivity. So all in all a pretty good story in the Security segment. I’d like to talk a little bit now about the portfolio shift that we’ve been undertaking since 2002. And as you can see from the next chart here, back in 2002 the revenues from our Construction and DIY segment were approximately two-thirds of the company and Industrial and Security were the remainder. As we look to 2008 on the upper right part of the chart, you can see a much more balanced revenue diverse revenue base in the company with the Construction and DIY business being 36% of the company, but the other two segments being very close in size, so a very balanced portfolio. It’s even more interesting, I think, when you look at the bottom part of the chart and look at how the operating margin mix has changed over the last six, seven years. Where the Construction and DIY business was contributing about 80% of the company’s operating margin back in 2002, you can see today that’s down to 31% although it has increased in dollar terms. The growth in the other two, the Industrial and Security segment, have dwarfed on a percentage basis the Construction and DIY. And now Security represents in terms of operating margin 43% of the company’s operating margin. So a really good story there and certainly one that served us well during this timeframe. And as we move on to the next chart, you can see we’ve also accomplished a reasonable amount of diversification as it relates to the end markets. And the residential construction part of our business is now approximately 33% with about half of that directly in the U.S. But we also have considerable positions in other areas. As you can see, 24% is in this Industrial area on the left upper part of that pie. We also have some commercial construction, about 12% of our revenue base which has held up well even though the market has been down in the U.S. in particular over the last year. We were slightly positive in terms of our revenue performance in commercial construction. Then you see retail. We have some activity particularly in our Security business in retail and mostly in the Access Technologies automatic door business, and that business actually had positive revenue growth last year. So again, even with the exposure to retail they’ve been able to gain share and they’ve been able to do a lot of refurb type of activity in that particular market. Then we have exposure, about 12% of the end market, in healthcare education in government, automotive repair which is not the manufacturing type of automotive volume but rather the auto mechanics, supplying tools to auto mechanics. Again that market has held up reasonably well. Mac and Facom you know are the big elements of our activity there. And then I mentioned Industrial and other. So a good, diverse revenue base in terms of end markets which has also served us reasonably well in this market. But that said, we haven’t had a – we haven’t been immune to the market declines in the Industrial segment and the CDIY segment. I think this next chart sort of puts that in crystal clear perspective. In the quarter for Industrial as we look at the left hand side of the chart, revenues were down 10% and the operating segment profit rate fell to 10.3%. It was down almost 500 basis points in light of the steep volume declines. Industrial and automotive repair revenues, particularly hurt by the Industrial markets in Facom. Organic revenues declined 8%. That was a pretty significant drop for them. In our North American Industrial and automotive repair business we did have the issue of economic contraction, particularly in our Industrial business. And then in the automotive repair business most of our issues there were self-inflicted as the driver count decreased in that particular business. And we are working diligently on fixing that issue as we speak. We also had growth. In Engineered Solutions we were up in double-digits there. That was driven primarily by acquisitions and a modest improvement in our storage business. If we look over at the Construction and DIY segment on the right-hand side, you can see even more dramatic revenue declines and even a more marked profit rate decline, almost 700 basis points, the operating profit dropping to about 6%. We like to think that this is a kind of trough profit rate for this particular business with these types of revenue declines that we’re experiencing. But we continued to have weakness in the U.S. residential construction markets. I don’t think that will surprise anybody. And in Europe we also had organic revenue declines, which were different than in the beginning of the performance in the beginning of the year when we actually had increases in Europe. So as time went on during the year, and we had talked about it on some previous calls, the organic weakness spread to Europe in the construction markets. And so now we pretty much have it across the board, and as well in the emerging markets. So it’s a global phenomenon not surprisingly. And the Bostage margin rate was negatively impacted by inflation, as steel inflation surged again although we don’t see that continuing in the future here in that particular business. And then their volume had some decline related to their continued market weakness. So that’s the story of the segments. Now as we move to working capital, I think this is a tremendously positive story. John mentioned the 0.6 of a turn improvement from 5.3 to 5.9 turns. That was $133 million reduction in absolute dollars of working capital and over $120 of that was directly cash related. There was a little bit of exchange impact as well. But as you look across the board, inventories came down $41 million. If you think about the fact that we had a double-digit unit volume decline, the degree of difficulty in order to accomplish that was extremely high and we were able to do it. And then on the receivable side we brought the accounts receivable down $128 million, which included $40 million or so of reduction in overdues from a year ago. So in this difficult economy with the credit issues and so forth we were actually able to reduce the overdues in our portfolio by $41 million with a concerted effort. And then of course payables dropped slightly, not surprisingly with the reduction in volume in inventories. What this says basically is that the Stanley Fulfillment System that we put in place several years ago is gaining momentum as we speak and it couldn’t be happening at a better time. I want to emphasize that the benefits from the Stanley Fulfillment System are primarily process related and they are not a one time phenomenon. These are fundamental changes that we’re making to the company’s processes and the way we do business that are having a positive impact on our cash generation. And in that regard as I said they are very timely. We’ve been at it a couple years. As I said this is not an overnight sensation. This is three yards and a cloud of dust. There’s four elements to the Stanley Fulfillment System. It involves something we call transformational lean, which is Stanley’s version of lean manufacturing, and enterprise lean. Also tremendous progress in something we call S&OP which is the way you synchronize the front end of the business with the back end of the business. And we’ve made enormous improvements across the company in S&OP and that’s why we’re able to endure a volume reduction of this magnitude and still bring our inventories down. On top of that, we have two other elements. One is complexity reduction and that is reducing the complexity of our products, the way we do business and our manufacturing footprint; and finally platform standardization. And so all of these things are progressing as we speak and contributing to this tremendous improvement in working capital. And obviously as I mentioned that’s had an impact on cash flow. And now I’m going to turn it over to our CFO, Don Allan. He’s going to talk about our cash flow performance.
Donald Allan Jr.: Thank you Jim. On Page 13 I just want to spend a few minutes and talk about that cash flow performance, focused primarily on the year. As Jim mentioned the working capital contribution really bolstered our cash flow and our free cash flow performance for 2008 with about $127 million of a contribution in that regard. And our operating cash flow was $560 million which was an increase over the prior year of about $20 million, which is an impressive performance when you consider the fact that our net income from continuing operations before the restructuring charges in the fourth quarter was actually down 12%. And so with that decline and with the focus on working capital, we were still able to achieve a sizable or decent increase in operating cash flow. John mentioned earlier on that our capital expenditures were slightly higher than we anticipated. It did increase about $50 million versus 2007. Approximately $30 of that was really planned strategic investments that we had in the pipeline since the beginning of the year. And then we had about $20 million of certain leasing structures that were terminated in the fourth quarter that due to the difficult credit markets we were not able to enter into new leasing structures at that point in time. So that’s really driving that increase. But still a very healthy free cash flow performance of almost $420 million in 2008. Regarding CapEx, as we look at 2009 we would expect that our CapEx would get down to more historical levels as a percentage of revenue, which would be about 2% as we mentioned in our press release this morning. The next page, if we take a look at our credit and liquidity status, it’s something that obviously everyone is concerned with the current economic environment. And we thought it would be good to just refresh everyone’s memory on a few things related to that. The first thing we want to mention is obviously we’ve had a long standing strategy to remain single A as far as our credit rating, and it’s served the company very well over the years. That is still a very important strategy for us going forward. In addition to that, we took several actions, two in particular in 2008, to insure that we had ample liquidity. In particular, in October when the markets were fairly turbulent, we did term out about $250 million of debt that will mature in 2013. In addition to that, we increased our credit line which really gives us approximately $800 million of liquidity, and in this time and economic circumstances it is a wonderful thing to have available to us. And then the third thing to mention is we really have no major unfunded obligations until 2012 as the chart depicts here on the right. Due to the equity unit structure that we entered into a few years ago, we will have a cash inflow as a result of the shares issuance in that transaction of $330 million in 2010. That will help us fund the bond obligation we have of $200 million in that year. So we feel that we’re in a very strong position regarding credit liquidity at this stage. As John mentioned earlier, we saw unprecedented unit volume declines in the fourth quarter here, 10% of volume decline. In our press release in December we indicated the importance of having to realign our cost base and our cost structures due to that, as well as due to the outlook we were seeing for 2009. So we took some significant actions as that press release indicated. Specifically our headcount was reduced over 2,000 employees which is approximately 10% of our workforce. We did certain reorganizations and elimination of management layers. And then we also had a closure of three plants in the United States as part of that restructuring. Then last but certainly not least we did suspend certain U.S. employee benefits on a temporary basis to really assist in those cost reduction actions, and to avoid to have to do additional headcount reductions. The cost associated with these actions was for the year, the entire restructuring was $92 million. The specific fourth quarter restructuring was $67 million, which is about just less than $0.60 EPS. The total year restructuring charges were $0.80 per share. The cash outflow associated with these restructurings we would expect about 85% of them are cash outflows and the remaining 15 are non-cash, in other words asset impairments. And we would estimate about 60 to 70% of that cash would be paid in 2009 and the remainder would be paid in 2010, as it does the process in Europe is much longer for doing these types of actions. The savings associated with all this is $140 million associated with the headcount reductions and that includes what we did throughout the year, not just in the fourth quarter. And so we feel like we’ve taken the appropriate steps there. In addition to that, we really attacked our discretionary costs, $55 million of actions, focuses on T&E and car and fleet costs, etc. And that’s something we’ll continue to attack as we go through 2009. The EPS impact added a positive $1.75 per share as a result of those actions, with $0.24 of that carrying over to 2010. Moving to the next page, we made a decision as you saw in our press release, not to provide 2009 guidance at this point until we see the economic conditions and the end markets begin to stabilize. However, we continue to constantly monitor these variables and we’ll post them as we go forward. But we did want to be able to provide as we indicated in our December 11 press release some assumptions to assist the financial community with some things that we’re seeing in ’09 as well as some assumptions to assist you with your modeling. And we have updated that in this press release this morning. If we start with unit volume, which is clearly the largest variable that we have at this point, as we head into the year it appears that the 10 to 12% unit volume decline is what we’re seeing in the early stages. If that was to continue throughout the entire year, the negative impact on our EPS would be $2.00 to $2.25. Now some of that’s volume associated just from the lost sales, but of course this is also an impact of under absorption in our plants that’s factored into that EPS assumption. Currencies as we mentioned in our December press release will have the same significant impact as well, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against some of the major currencies that we have like the euro, the Australian dollar, and the Canadian dollar in particular. And we’re estimating that on current exchange rates that it would be about a $0.50 negative if those exchange rates remain constant throughout the year. If the exchange rates move 5% either way, it probably is about a 10 to 12% impact, positive or negative depending on which way they move. Now the impact will likely be most of it will occur in the first half of 2009, about 90% of that is what we expect as exchange rates begin to or the U.S. dollar began to strengthen as ’08 continued on throughout the year. Looking at inflation and pricing, which is an area which everyone is very interested in, we do expect as John mentioned to see some inflation especially in the first quarter and the early part of ’09 as we have that carryover effect. If we look at commodity prices today, there is a possibility that we may have some deflation in the back half of the year, but that’s difficult to predict at this point in time. Pricing, we will certainly have a carryover effect as mentioned in our press release. That would likely contribute $30 to $50 million of a positive. So overall our view is that we will likely have some type of modest positive impact as a result of those two items. But clearly there’s variables that could change the result of that going forward. I mentioned the cost reduction program of $1.75 already. As far as restructuring charges, we mentioned in our press release this morning that we expect to probably have approximately 50% of our ’08 level charges, which would be about $0.40 EPS in 2009. And then last but certainly not least, accretion for the 2008 acquisitions that we’ve already done, will be at $0.10 to $0.12 EPS. So we feel this is helpful information for all of you as you begin to look at our company in 2009. Just keep in mind that we continue to be committed to take the actions to protect our earnings and our cash flow and our balance sheet going forward. As we summarize the call this morning, just looking back, a few things to point out. We feel we’ve taken as I mentioned the aggressive and proactive restructuring actions to adjust our cost base and prepare ourselves for 2009 and be ready when the economic conditions begin to improve. We also demonstrated the ability to mitigate inflation with customer pricing actions where we had $140 million inflation in 2008, with offsetting $123 million in price recovery. Free cash flow is a great story, really driven by that strong working capital performance with a proven success of the Stanley fulfillment system. As we look forward, we are dedicated as I mentioned to continue to take steps needed to maintain our upper tier credit rating. And I had also mentioned that we have no unfunded debt obligations until 2012 and we feel very good about our liquidity position. As all companies who are multi-nationals like us, we will be subject to potential negative impact of fluctuations in currencies and that is something that we monitor as we go throughout the year here. And certainly last but not least is we will continue to be focused on successful integration of our acquisitions we’ve done and maximize those synergies going forward, as well as focus on SFS in 2009 and beyond.
Kate White: Jennifer, now we are ready to take question and answers.
Operator: Your first question comes from James Lucas.
James Lucas: Factoring in the volume decline of down 10 to 12% and you look at your contingency planning and 2009, at what point do you think about having to take additional actions or do you think that you’ve got the cost structure in line if things were to remain stable today? And secondly, cash flow has been a fantastic story and otherwise there hasn’t been a lot of good news. When you look at the job you’ve done on working capital, what opportunities remain there?
John F. Lundgren: Jim, this is John. Good morning. I’ll take the first half and I’ll let Jim take the second part of that question because he took it in the presentation and some of the initiatives that he’s leading are really, really the drivers in cash flow. Your question on contingency planning if you will, or is there yet another way that is right on it’s  a topic that as recently as the middle of December and again already this year we’ve discussed with senior management. If volume continues to decline at the rate it’s declined the last two quarters, and we may well need another round of downsizing businesses later on in the year. Without being terribly specific, it would be in the second half of the year. Everything we’ve talked about and everything we’ve done it’s going to take us six months to get it implemented. So sometime between April and June, we’ll have a look forward. Hopefully the situation will be a little more clear. If it’s no worse than it is now, what Don’s put forward in terms of guidance suggests we’ve done everything we can do with a reasonable payback. If the situation’s worse, sometime in the third quarter we have contingency plans, I would say 50% developed and we’ve got three to four months to finalize those for yet another round, which of course we’re hoping isn’t necessary. But I think we’d be less than responsible as an executive management team if we didn’t have those contingency plans in place. I’m going to let Jim talk about the continued operations and on continued opportunities in cash flow, primarily via FSS because as Don suggested it’s working capital in general is a huge source of cash for us. We are not going to let up. And I’m going to turn it on over to Jim.
James M. Loree: Okay. Thank you John. Well I think first of all, we could have done better than 5.9 in turns had it not been for the precipitous volume decline and so I think there is a calibration that can occur where we clearly believe that in ’09 that we can do better than 5.9 turns. Starting with that, I think that is relatively clear to us. As we get into north of 6 turns and north, it gets a little murkier. We do know that we have great momentum. We do know that we have a business process transformation and not just a one act play. And there is a lot of act – [Audio Impairment – 22 seconds]
John F. Lundgren: - that historically we’ve proven that providing it gives more information to more people than quite frankly we want to have out in the public domain. We’ll say two things. Acquisitions contributed for two reasons. One they were positive and Brett’s team did a really good job bringing them on board quickly and having them up and running as part of our business in absolute terms. Secondarily, we acquired albeit at relatively high prices, we acquired some very high margin businesses with the equivalent to become even higher margin when we started to realize the synergies. Number one. Number two, their markets were not as adversely impacted as I suggested by some of the macroeconomic factors, so there was some reasonable organic growth. Third and last, offset by as Jim touched on on the mechanical side the continued headwind from the loss of about  $50 million annually or $12.5 million a quarter of high margin hardware business. So to summarize, great performance in convergent, both in terms of growth and margin enhancement and synergy achievement; solid performance in our mechanical side, somewhat offset by the volume in margin drag of hardware which as Jim pointed out has anniversaried so we see some potential for some reasonable momentum in the mechanical segment going forward.
[Unidentified Analyst]: What I’m wondering is, has the structural profitability of the convergent business improved when you do take out the acquisitions that sort of mix up the margin?
James M. Loree: Absolutely. I mean, what I think you basically have – when I talked earlier about the benefits of the reverse integration, that is said another way, what’s happened is we’ve taken the legacy systems integration business that we had before we bought HSM and we’ve converted it to the HSM business model. Now what that means is recurring revenue has become an extremely important part of – first of all, you can’t distinguish between the two organizations any more. They’ve become one. And secondly the folks that used to sell systems integration, which was basically installation, are now selling monitoring in addition to their installation which in and of itself drives higher gross margins and higher operating margins. And that’s what’s happening. And the segment is basically legacy operating margins have gone from mid-single digits up to double-digits. And at the same time HSM brought in very high operating margin and Sonatrol with the synergies in addition to GDP all mix up the operating and the gross margins.
Kate White: Next question, Jennifer.
Operator: Your next question comes from is from Eric Bosshard.
Eric Bosshard: First of all, the lack of providing 2009 guidance you attributed to the volatility. Can you just talk about where you see the greatest volatility or uncertainty in 2009 that’s sort of pushing you to that decision?
John F. Lundgren: I think yes, Don provided the guidance obviously with a unanimous agreement from Jim and me and others. And a big piece of it of course is volume because we’ve had a 7 and 10% consecutive volume decline. So economically and numerically that’s the biggest piece. But Don why don’t you address the first – the first half of Eric’s question?
Donald Allan Jr.: Yes, Eric, I think the volatility clearly is in the unit volume. And the difficulty of seeing out beyond a few months is very hard for many companies including us to see. And the performance we saw in the fourth quarter with our different segments where we are CDIY and Industrial segment having significant volume losses, and those would be the ones that we would be the most focused on. You know, what it would mean for them going forward into 2009. Obviously the Security segment we want to monitor closely as well to insure that there’s no volume loss and impact there. But it’s the first two segments that we’re really focused on going forward.
John F. Lundgren: And Eric so you don’t cut off and you get to ask your second question, let me just add, you know our business extraordinarily well. With the exception of some of our Security business and our Engineered Storage Solution business and hydraulics, these are very short cycle businesses. Particularly CDIY and Bostage and many of our smaller Industrial tool business, I know you know and most of the people on the call, you know, understand that a major customer orders on Monday and we ship it on Wednesday. And that’s, you know, we have our supply chains linked as well as we can. But you know simply said that the short cycle nature of those businesses and the recent history that’s just so out of proportion with anything else we’ve ever seen is what causes let me say our lack of clarity into the even short term future. But you had a follow-up I know.
Eric Bosshard: Yes. The follow-up is in Security, the flat organic performance in the fourth quarter is impressive. As you look at historically and you’ve talked a little bit about the order book in that business and can you just give us a little bit of sense of what that looks like and how we should even be thinking about that business in total for 2009 based on sort of indications in orders and quoting activity you’re seeing now?
John F. Lundgren: No, all we want to say you know although I’d argue we have probably better visibility into Security than others, but we really don’t want to be talking about order books on this call. Two things happened. Two things that I think are appropriate and hopefully helpful. One is a relatively small percentage of our Security business, mechanical and convergent, is based on new construction. A smaller percentage than one might think. Second, regardless I could give you a number for the order book and it would not help you unless I were to give you more granularity than is readily apparent, because it could be a contracted breadth business as won for a new hospital that’s going to be constructed in December, or it could be an installation at a retailer next week. So the number itself depending on when those projects are scheduled to be performed you know really wouldn’t help you. But candidly it’s a fair question, but it’s not just one we want to be talking about on an earnings call.
Kate White: Next question, Jennifer.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sam Darkatsh.
Sam Darkatsh: First off, your pricing in Q4 was up 4 and if I recall correctly it was up 3% in the third quarter. Does that imply that you had perhaps a small round of price increases in the fourth quarter? Or was that a timing issue as to when the pricing went through in the third quarter? Was that mixed? That was the first question. Second question would be, what are your trends you’re seeing sell through versus sell in? And the last question would be, I don’t recall whether you said what convergent organic growth was. You mentioned what it overall was but not organically. Those are my three questions.
James M. Loree: Okay. Well, let’s address them in reverse order. How about that? Although I think the limit is two questions, isn’t it? That’s all right. We’ll do both of these. So as far as the convergent organic growth, it’s very difficult to give an accurate number for the sub-segment of convergent because the HSM acquisition and all the acquisitions are mixed together. But as far as we can tell, we were up modestly, up a point or two. Something like that. Nothing dramatic. But I wouldn’t take that number to the bank and bet on it. But I think directionally it’s accurate. The sell throughs, sell in, retailers in the United States were very judicious with their inventory management. If anything, they’re average to slightly below average levels with their inventory at this point in time. So I think that bodes – you know our inventories are in good shape. Their inventories are in good shape. If we ever get any stabilization in housing prices, it could be very interesting in terms of volume. But we don’t see that at this point in time. Or housing sales. Housing prices we’re beginning to see some stabilization. And then the third question was – yes, do you want to take that one?
John F. Lundgren: Simply said, Sam, very few pricing actions implemented in the fourth quarter. What you saw in the third quarter or fourth quarter were actions taken in the second half of the year and reflected in Don’s outlook is the fact that despite what’s going on in materials market it took us a while to get those prices. We do see some carry forward that is going to help us in the early parts of the year and of course it should be clear as close as you follow Stanley what focus we place on price realization through our COE and maintaining those prices as long as we can. Because it took us three to six months to get them, despite 88% recovery. So it’s important that they don’t decline faster than it took us to realize them. And that’s the positive lift. But it’s much more carry over than it is new actions.
Kate White: Next question, Jennifer.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nigel Coe.
Nigel Coe: Inventories was obviously just a fantastic storage in the quarter particularly when you think about the price inflation within those inventories. What impact did that have on the margins year-on-year?
John F. Lundgren: The impact of the price inflation arbitrage? Is that what you’re –
Nigel Coe: No, no, no – it’s inventory reduction.
John F. Lundgren: Oh, inventory reduction. Well the exact impact on margin year-over-year is difficult to assess. But certainly as you lower your volumes, you lower your inventory, you definitely get a negative impact to your margin rate. And it can – it’s certainly part of the kind of assumptions we gave you for ’09 related to the volume impact. As far as inventory, I would say that it was not a huge impact in 2008. But it did have a slight negative impact.
Nigel Coe: I think S&P announced last week they’re putting you on reviewing the rating. Can you just confirm that there would be no impact from losing a notch or two of your rating?
John F. Lundgren: Well, last I heard it was Moody’s and not S&P and what they did was they put us under review for possible downgrade from single A where we are at this point in time. That is about a several month process, where we have the opportunity to go talk to them and explain our situation in more detail. And then have a discussion with them about what we might to prospectively if they have continuing concerns after that. And we’ll see how that plays out. So there’s nothing that is cast in concrete at this point in time. It clearly is a possibility. We don’t see why it makes sense. However, you know, we want to talk to them and get their perspective on it.
Kate White: The next question, Jennifer.
Operator: Your next question comes from Seth Weber.
Seth Weber: Could we just go back to the Security margin and acquisition question again for a second? Do these acquisitions that you made, do they change the historical seasonality that we’ve seen in the margin in that business, you know where fourth quarter is typically lower?
John F. Lundgren: A little bit. You’ll recall there were two things. And what it will do is partially mitigate it. The two things historically driving the large swings in margins 200 to 400 basis points in a quarter were second and third quarters were historically higher than fourth and first quarters were primarily in our mechanical security segment. Those seasonality elements still exist, which is one reason we’re not providing margin by sub-segment within sub-segment, because it’s more information than anybody can realistically or practically use. But we do a tremendous amount of mechanical locking business on university campuses. We normally do that when university students are not there. Those tend to be the months of June and July, which are in the second and third quarter and that’s very good. It’s incremental high margin business, which inflates second and third quarter at the expense if you will of first and fourth quarter. The second issue is on installs, which relates primarily to our access technologies business, secondarily to some of our monitoring and other businesses where we encounter site readiness issues in the first and fourth quarter, where we show up to put in a door and the concrete hasn’t been poured because of the snowstorm or because of rains in the Southwest or something of that nature. Again, so we get some unanticipated and difficult to plan volume reductions, weather related in the first and fourth quarter which are rarely an issue in the second and third calendar quarters. Because HSM, Sonatrol, GDP have added meaningful revenue and they’ve added it in convergent and they are less susceptible to site readiness issues and slightly less involved in particularly campus university installations, although they do do some of that, that seasonality will be partially mitigated. But it will not disappear.
Seth Weber: And if we could just flip over to the other two business segments, I think on the call last quarter you talked about a new fairly large contract or some sort of award that you’d won on the CDIY business. Did that weigh on the margin at all in the quarter? And then my follow-up question would be, I think Jim you had mentioned that you kind of hoped the CDIY margins have bottomed here. You didn’t make that some comment on Industrial. Do you think Industrial margins could yet still go down further?
John F. Lundgren: We as a policy don’t name customers names on this call, but the contract we won is encouraging. There was little impact in the fourth quarter although what impact was there was positive, you know, and it will offset some of the headwinds going forward in the first quarter. On the CDIY business, Jim, do you want to take the second half?
James M. Loree: Yes, I mean, I think there’s a number of things that are going to occur within Industrial, that might occur within Industrial, that could move the margins down a little bit. Probably not precipitously from here; on the other hand they could go up. So it’s a little bit of the same kind of issue that we had relative to guidance. There’s the big $64,000 question is what’s unit volume going to do? And what’s the economy going to do? And clearly there’s a healthy dose of fixed costs in the Industrial business, definitely as much as anywhere from a manufacturing perspective in the plant system. And so there is a significant absorption issue in this segment when volume goes down. By the same token, you get benefits when it goes up. So I can’t give you a specific answer per se, although I will say that the unit volume declines that the company has experienced over the last two quarters are unprecedented. In looking back all the way to the ‘70s, we have not ever had two quarters where the unit volume declines were greater than 7% for two consecutive quarters. So now we have had that, for the first time, and so we’re now in uncharted territories. We expect as we indicated in our documentation, we expect that we’ll have similar unit volume performance in the first quarter that we had in the fourth. That would be three consecutive quarters. It’s difficult for me to imagine that this could go on at this level for an extended period of time. However, you know, we have to prepare for the possibility that it could and we are preparing for that possibility, although we don’t expect it to occur. If we had a dramatic further drop in volume in Industrial, yes, they could go down further. And yes, we would take action.
Kate White: Next question, Jennifer.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut.
Michael Rehaut: First question just on unit volume, you know, when you did the prerelease about a month ago you indicated expectation for volume down 12 to 14% and it came in a bit better than that. But you also at the same time in the ’09 sort of guidelines kind of took the range a little bit lower, I guess being a little bit more cautious or conservative there in terms of first negative 10, you went to negative 10 to 12. I just wanted to know if there was anything that occurred I guess in the December month that you know caused the 4Q volume decline to be a bit better than initial guidance and if that had anything to do with a little bit more conservative take in the ’09 guidelines?
John F. Lundgren: Yes. I mean simply said, December ended a little better than we had anticipated, given where our order book stood on December 11 when we did a prerelease. The teams did a nice job, shipping what we had on order. At the same time as Jim demonstrated quite well, we did nothing to pull any business forward. We worked hard on balancing production with demand. And as a consequence the last two weeks of December were a little better than we anticipated that they might be. And as a consequence we said this wasn’t our intent but to the extent that any of that came out of the first quarter, the first quarter could be a little softer. As I know you’re acutely aware, the home centers and all large retailers given that their fiscal years end January 31, the month of January is a very, very difficult month to project business. And it’s not even always a good indicator of the quarter. Specifically, it’s the way the business models work, orders tend to be light as do shipments in the month of January. And quite often the lighter they are in January, the better they are in February and March, thus making first quarter a relatively normal quarter in terms of volume. Given the tremendous uncertainty out there right now, it makes it even more difficult to project December actuals and January orders into a first quarter number. So simply said, we’ve changed nothing, Mike, from the long term perspective. December was a little better. We said if that unintentionally came out of the first quarter of the year, it might be a little worse.
Michael Rehaut: First just a follow on to that, where was it a little bit better in December than you anticipated? And I just don’t want to get cut off in terms of my actual second question, but any type of comments you can give in terms of pension expense expected in ’09 versus ’08, given the declines in the equity markets for the extent that you can help us in terms of your thinking for budgeting there?
John F. Lundgren: That’s fine, because I think it’s a relevant question and because it’s a non-issue for Stanley, I’m glad you asked it and it’s one that Don will address. In terms of the volume, quite frankly it was better literally across the board. Both Security businesses finished strong, our CDIY segment did not finish as weakly as we’d anticipated, and there were as you know our Industrial segment is a very large diverse portfolio of businesses, some a little up, some a little down. But simply said it was across the board with convergent and mechanical Security finishing strong. Neither Bostage or consumer tools and storage finished strong but they weren’t quite as weak as we’d anticipated, and mixed results across our Industrial portfolio. Don do you want to talk a little bit about pension expense?
Donald Allan Jr.: Sure. As you’re probably aware, you know, pension expense is not a big number for Stanley Works. We don’t have many defined contribution plans which would drive a lot of pension expense.
John F. Lundgren: We provide benefit plans. We have a lot of defined contribution plans.
Donald Allan Jr.: And as a result, we don’t expect our pension expense to go up much at all in 2009. It could be a modest increase but the overall number is relatively immaterial for the company and the increase would follow that same way.
John F. Lundgren: And as a consequence that’s probably nothing we need to adjust existing models for.
Kate White: Last question, Jennifer.
Operator: Your last question comes from Kenneth Zener.
Kenneth Zener: Just looking at Security and the convergent side of that business, I think about 30% of that business currently is recurring revenue. Given the backward integration that you’re having in HSM and the likelihood that installs will fall at a greater rate than recurring revenue, I assume, can you talk about where that might go in terms of some level of sensitivity? If your install slides down, could that convergent get to 40 plus percent of recurring revenue?
James M. Loree: First of all convergent recurring mix and convergent is about 40%, not 30. And at the moment we’re not expecting a significant contraction in the installs, nor are we experiencing one. If it were to occur, basically the profit margin on install is considerably less than it is on the recurring revenue. I mean you’re talking about gross margins that are double on a rate basis on the recurring side. So you know it’s not going to have a dramatic impact because it will have some negative impact if we had a big dive in installations, but not a dramatic impact because the mix - the rate mix would go up. It would have a longer term impact for sure because that stream of recurring revenue over time would be affected by lower installs. So that’s really the dynamic there.
Kenneth Zener: And that 40% number that includes the recent French acquisition I assume?
James M. Loree: Includes everything, yes.
John F. Lundgren: Includes everything. All in breadth convergence business as we reported.
Kate White: Thank you very much everybody for your participation today. Again if you have any questions please call Corbin Walburger or myself. Our contact information is both in the press release and on the website and have a wonderful day. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Reeves – Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice PresidentAnalysts Nishu Sood - Deutsche BankAnalyst for David Goldberg - UBS SecuritiesDavid S. MacGregor - Longbow ResearchSam Darkatsh - Raymond JamesPeter Lisnic - Robert W. BairdDennis McGill - Zelman & AssociatesOperator My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Black & Decker third quarter conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Rothleitner, Vice President Investor Relations and Treasurer.Mark M. Rothleitner Welcome to Black & Decker’s third quarter conference call. On today’s call our Chief Executive Officer, Nolan D. Archibald and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen F. Reeves will discuss our third quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2008. Their comments should take about 15 minutes and then we will answer your questions. In keeping with SEC requirements, I advise that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect the Black & Decker Corporation, please review the reports we have filed with the SEC. In addition we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of SEC Regulation G. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is included on the corporation’s website under the Investor Relations section. And now, I will turn it over to Nolan.Nolan D. Archibald This morning Black & Decker announced solid earnings and free cash flow for third quarter. Before we discuss those results however, I would like to make a few comments in light of recent events. As you know our industry has faced a very difficult business environment over the past two years. A global credit crisis will make conditions even more difficult. Against this backdrop it is important to remember the underlying strength of Black & Decker’s people and business model. Our world class innovations and leading brands combined with financial discipline will help us emerge from this challenging period well positioned for the future. During my 23 years at Black & Decker we have overcome many challenges. I am very proud of the team that we have at Black & Decker and I am confident that we will overcome these challenges as well.Turning to the third quarter, our operating performance was a little better than we had forecasted in July. Sales decreased 4% in line with our guidelines including three percentage points of favorable foreign exchange. Excluding a charge from additional structuring actions, our operating margins were 8.6% versus 10.1% last year. This was above our expectations due to expense reduction efforts. Earnings per share were $1.42 for the quarter versus $1.59 in 2007.This quarter’s EPS was affected by a restructuring charge but that impact was offset by favorable taxes and other non-operating items. Now let me discuss our business segments, sales at our worldwide power tools and accessory segment decreased 6%. As we expected the North American decline was smaller than in the first half. Business conditions in Europe however, weakened significantly this quarter. In the US industrial products group sales decreased high single digits. Depressed housing and decelerating commercial construction hurt our sales particularly in the IC channel. Overall, our cordless sales improved slightly but other major categories had double digit declines. Results of the home centers were mixed. Demand was down in this channel, but we benefitted from new listings at major customer. Following cautious inventory management at our key customers in the first half the order trend improved sequentially this quarter.In the US consumer products group sales decreased double digits this quarter. As we have discussed previously this business has been affected by reduced pressure washing listings and the transition out of the Firestorm sub brand. These factors did not affect sales as much as in the first half due to seasonality of the initial shipments of our new porter cable line. Excluding pressure washers sell through at the home improvement centers decreased mid single digits. This was consistent with the second quarter trend.In Europe sales declined in the double digit rate this quarter. Economic growth has slowed significantly throughout Western Europe with a few countries entering a recession and others expected to follow. Our sales were particularly weak in the UK and Iberia again this quarter. Performance was similar for the industrial and consumer businesses reflecting lower demand and inventory reductions by our customers.We saw continued growth in the Middle East and double digit gains in Eastern Europe but on a much lower sales base than in Western Europe. In Latin America our sales rose at a rate in the teens extending an impressive growth trend. All key product lines grew significantly as did each key region. In the Asia Pacific region a decline in Australia and New Zealand roughly offset growth in China and South East Asia.Return on sales for the power tools and accessory business decreased this quarter to 7.5%. SG&A spending was down both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. Gross Margin however was down significantly particularly in our US consumer business. Component inflation, pricing and unfavorable mix all had a negative effect on the segment. In our hardware and home improvement segment sales decreased 13%. We knew in July we faced a difficult comparison so this performance met our expectations.Last year SmartKey drove sales growth for this segment despite the housing downturn. That comparison combined with ongoing construction declines drove the decline of roughly 20% for the US lock business. Sales through key retailers was roughly flat as SmartKey continues to gain recognition and market share. Sales in the price Pfister faucet business decreased slightly. In the wholesale channel which is significantly tied to new housing sales were down double digits.Pfister’s larger channel retail saw modest sales growth. Increases in inventory retail partially to support relisting gains helped our results this quarter. Operating margins for the hardware and home improvement segment decreased 100 basis points year-on-year to 11.3%. Significantly lower sales volume against slightly lower SG&A spending caused the margin decline.Partially offsetting this was productivity gains which helped the segment post strong gross margins. We are pleased to see this improvement in a quarter where production and inventory levels continue to fall. In the fastening and assembly systems segment sales fell 2%. The well documented challenges facing US auto makers resulted in the double digit decline for this part of operations in Asia and Brazil where we grew double digits, compensated for the US shortfall. European sales were flat this quarter reflecting the slowing economic conditions. Our margin for the fastening segment was virtually flat at 15.5% for the quarter. In September our Emhart business acquired Spiralock a provider of highly engineered threaded fastener solutions. This is a small addition of roughly $15 million dollars of annualized savings which we plan to grow by leveraging Emhart’s global platform.As we have said in the past the industrial fastening business has outstanding potential. As a result we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in this segment. Now I will turn the time over to Steve who will discuss our financials in more detail. Stephen F. Reeves Starting with the income statement sales were $1.6 billion for the quarter, a 4% year-on-year decline. Organically, volume was -6% and price was -1%. In July we expected price to be moderately positive for the second half and neutral for the full year. While we are implementing price increases in several parts of the company we have also faced some price competition in increased promotions particularly in Europe and the US consumer business.Currency translation added 3% to sales in the third quarter, a little less than in the first half due to the strengthening of the dollar late in the quarter. Gross margin was 32.4% for the quarter, 160 basis points below last year and down slightly versus the second quarter. The main driver remains component cost inflation including the impact of Chinese currency and VAT policy. While many commodities fell during this quarter our component contracts lagged the spot prices therefore, inflation still had an approximate $30 million dollar impact in the third quarter and $120 million year-to-date.For the full year we can continue to expect roughly $145 million of component inflation. In addition to inflation this quarter’s margins were unfavorably affected by mix. As in the second quarter, productivity gains and restructuring savings roughly offset the negative price. We made outstanding progress on SG&A this quarter reducing expenses by $18 million or 5%. Despite lower volume SG&A fell as a percentage of sales. Power tools and accessories continue to aggressively manage expenses posting decreases in every major spending category.During the quarter we recorded a restructuring charge of $16 million which had a $0.21 impact on EPS. Most of this charge relates to a workforce reduction in the tools business to address the slowing economy in certain international markets. In addition we are taking further restructuring actions in hardware and home improvement including reconfiguration of our Mexican manufacturing operations. We anticipate these actions will generate annual pre-tax savings of approximately $15 million starting in 2009.In total these actions and the others we have previously announced are on track to reduce costs by $20 million in 2008 with incremental savings of $30 million in 2009.Interest expense for the quarter was lower than the prior year primarily due to favorable interest rates for most of the quarter. As you know the global credit crisis has caused rates to move up dramatically since mid-September. Therefore we expect higher net interest expense for the fourth quarter. As we have often seen since FIN 48 became effective, the tax rate had a significant effect on earnings this quarter.Last year we announced the settlement of a tax matter with the US government which had a favorable impact on earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007. In the third quarter we made the final payment on this settlement and released $7.2 million of remaining reserves adding $0.12 to EPS.Other small tax adjustments contributed another $0.04 to EPS relative to the tax rate assumed in our prior guidance. As Nolan mentioned, the tax and other income favorability relative to our prior guidance essentially offset the impact of the restructuring charge on net earnings.In the current credit environment liquidity is especially important. We generated $212 million of free cash flow in the quarter versus $113 million last year. The year-to-date total is $258 million down from $413 million in the prior year. Considering business conditions and our unusually strong cash generation in early 2007, we remain pleased with our working capital and cash performance.Inventory at quarter end was 12% below last September significantly outpacing the decline in sales. Both the power tools and HHI segments lowered their inventories more than 15%. While we anticipate free cash flow in the fourth quarter will not match third quarter level, we expect at least 100% conversion of the full year net earnings.After repurchasing 5% of our outstanding shares in the first half, we did not buy any since the first week in July. We had planned to slow the pace of repurchases partly in anticipation of bolt-on acquisitions. Near quarter end it also became clear that we should preserve our liquidity.As a result of strong cash flow and financial discipline, our balance sheet is in good shape to support our business. We reduced net debt by $137 million from the end of the second quarter and decreased average short-term borrowings by roughly $40 million versus the first half. During the recent volatile period we have issued commercial paper each day. In addition we have incurred no direct losses related to exposure to any of the failed financial institutions. As a reminder, none of our long-term debt matures until 2011 and we maintain solid investment grade debt ratings of BBB flat and BAA2.In the near term our plan for cash deployment is to maintain liquidity, solid debt ratings and our dividend. We will still consider bolt-on acquisitions of high quality businesses at compelling valuations. Over the longer term we remain committed to aggressive redeployment of free cash flow including share repurchases to drive shareholder value.Now I’ll turn it back to Nolan to discuss the outlook for the rest of 2008.Nolan D. Archibald Entering the fourth quarter we face unprecedented level of market volatility and economic uncertainty. It is reasonable to expect that the credit crisis will affect our construction and automotive end markets. US housing construction which has already declined more than 50% from the peak appears to be taking another step down. We’ve also seen a rapid deterioration in European economies and a slowing of capital investment in growth regions. As we discussed, our leadership is taking the necessary cost actions in response to these conditions.However it is also important to maintain our market leadership through new products. This holiday season our consumer business will be spotlighting several innovative cordless products. Smart Select drills and Smart Select jigsaws make it easy for end users to fine tune the tool speed and power to the application. The new Smart Driver simplified screw driving with a retractable screw holder, Smart Clutch System and lithium ion lightweight power. We have extended our popular pivot VAC platform with an 18-volt floor VAC which is ideal for cleaning in hard-to-reach places.As I mentioned earlier, we have started shipping the new Porter-Cable tools. This line gives light contractors and high end do-it-yourselfers a reasonably priced alternative with strong performance.DeWalt is launching several key corded products in the fourth quarter. The lineup includes a band saw, a ½-inch drill, a stud and joist drill, and the award-winning track saw. DeWalt is a leader in motor technology and the innovations in these tools enable users to complete applications 25% to 55% faster.In cordless we’ve continued to expand our 18-volt franchise and have major launches such as the new Ni-CAD and Lithium XRP lines planned for 2009.This new product lineup puts us in a good position for the fourth quarter. However we anticipate continued deterioration in macro conditions. Therefore we expect high single-digit organic sales decline for the fourth quarter including neutral price. Based on current exchange rates we are modeling 3% to 4% of unfavorable currency.We also anticipate incremental pressure on our margins in the fourth quarter. Component prices have not yet eased and we expect significant costs from product transitions during the quarter. Our European business which has delivered strong margins in recent years faces lower volumes and less favorable currency. Savings from the restructuring actions we are currently implementing will not be fully realized until 2009.As a result we expect operating margins in the 6% to 7% range for the quarter. Last year our fourth quarter operating margin was 3.7% including an unfavorable 430 basis points from a restructuring charge, environmental charge and product recall.As mentioned earlier, our interest expense will likely increase versus the fourth quarter of 2007. We are assuming a tax rate of 29% and diluted share count remaining around 60.5 million in the fourth quarter. In total we expect diluted EPS in the range of $0.70 to $0.90 for the fourth quarter and $5.20 to $5.40 for the full year. Consistent with our previous guidance, this full range excludes year-to-date restructuring charges of $0.41 per share. Our fourth quarter range is wider than usual reflecting significant uncertainty in the global market place.In summary, Black & Decker continues to deliver solid earnings and cash flow despite the economic downturn. EPS and operating performance exceeded our expectations this quarter. We remain the most innovative company in our industry with a broad line up of corded and cordless new products for the fourth quarter.We aggressively lowered SG&A spending and developed additional cost reduction plans. We generated strong free cash flow of $212 million for the quarter and are on track to exceed 100% conversion for the full year. We reduced inventory sharply and improved turns. We made a small fastening acquisition and continue evaluating opportunities to take advantage of a more normal M&A market. And we strengthened our balance sheet providing stability in volatile times.We remain confident that our experienced management team, strong financial position and proven strategy will enable Black & Decker to deliver long-term growth and create value for our shareholders.That concludes my prepared remarks now. I’ll turn the time back to the operator and we’ll answer your questions.Question-and-Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank.Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank I am trying to understand what you are seeing incrementally that has led to such a substantial reduction for your expectations for the fourth quarter. If I look at the components, your sales are kind of coming in line with where you’d expected, components costs may have not seen the benefit yet of declining commodity costs but I certainly wouldn’t have expected them to get worse. The only thing you mentioned was a product transition cost but I’m sure that can’t account for all of the shortfall here. So what exactly is it that you’re seeing and factoring in here that has led to such a sharp reduction in your expectations for the fourth quarter?Nolan D. Archibald Well, you mentioned commodity costs. They continue to be a strong headwind for us. You mentioned the transition costs that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. With several new listings that we’ve gained at our major retailers, we’re going to have some increased transition costs. And we are just very concerned about a very unpredictable economy out there. We find it very, very difficult to predict in this volatile economy. Lastly, Europe has decreased significantly as far as the macro economic conditions in Western Europe.Steve, would you like to add anything?Stephen F. Reeves I think the main driver is Europe and our more pessimistic outlook relative to the top line there. In addition, when we provided guidance back in July it was probably at the low water mark for the US dollar versus most major currencies. Based on where currencies are today the translation effect of our international operations is greatly reduced from where we had provided prior guidance. The European economic issues and the currency translation are the two big drivers. There are other puts and takes including a little bit higher interest expense.Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank About a year or two ago your European operation had achieved rough parity in terms of operating margins with the rest of the world with the US. How has that looked in the third quarter and how will that be in the fourth quarter?Nolan D. Archibald Year-to-date we’ve done still pretty well in Europe relatively speaking. In fact our European and international operations have very good margins right now but we see a slowing in Europe so those margins are going to be affected somewhat. We still have strong operating margins relative to other businesses.Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Obviously you’ve seen over $500 million of commodity cost impact over the last couple of years as a headwind. Could we expect a tailwind in 2009 at current pricing levels and about what might that be?Nolan D. Archibald Commodity prices have come down in most of our commodities. We’ve seen a real easing. For instance I think copper now is about half what it was at its peak. Steel still remains high so we still have a headwind there. We’ve tried to lock in some of the prices what we thought was reasonable. So on balance it may take us a few months to see some of those benefits coming to us.Stephen F. Reeves As Nolan mentioned, we have seen some of the commodities come off certainly their peaks and some have retrenched quite a bit. Steel is still up over last year although one would presume that if the economy continues to deteriorate that will come down further. All of the commodity benefits that we should eventually see will take a while to work their way through our supply chain obviously. While we’ve reduced our inventory, it was bought principally at pre-decline rates so you shouldn’t see much of a benefit in the fourth quarter.As you look into 2009 as Nolan mentioned, we do hedge some of our commodity exposure. Some of those contracts are at rates above where current market stands. In addition some of our commodities reprice on various indices; some based on quarterly reprices; some on six month reprices. So there will be a favorable effect on 2009 from reduced commodity costs but it’ll work its way through later in the year as opposed to the beginning of the year.Operator Our next question comes from Analyst for David Goldberg - UBS Securities.Analyst for David Goldberg - UBS Securities You guys discussed a little bit of the pressures that you’re seeing at the big box retailers and I know that you’ve had some transitions there that are helping you. But as we come upon the fourth quarter, can you just talk about any plans that they have in terms of incentives and how that could impact what you’re seeing?Nolan D. Archibald I don’t see any incremental change there. In this difficult economy we’ve been rather aggressive with our promotions at all of our major customers and that will continue in the fourth quarter. I don’t see any real differences than what we’ve been doing in the third quarter.Analyst for David Goldberg - UBS Securities As you’ve seen the commodity prices come down, I know that you said you haven’t really seen the benefit of that yet, but are you getting any pressure from retailers or other customers in terms of the price increases that you’re still looking for?Nolan D. Archibald We have not. They always want lower prices but we have been unable to pass on the significant price increases that we’ve had over the last several years so I think they’re understanding of that. Therefore because we’ve seen some easing recently the fact that we never passed all of those costs on to begin with I think is a pretty good argument and I think they’re understanding about it.Operator Our next question comes from David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research.David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research The share repurchase program has been a pretty key part of your strategy for some time now and you mentioned that this quarter the thought prevailed that maybe it was a good time to start being careful with cash and husbanding cash. I’m just wondering if you could talk just about your plans with respect to share repurchase activity over the next visible time horizon, two to three quarters?Nolan D. Archibald Historically, as you are well aware, share repurchase has been right at the top of our list although acquisitions we prefer. We just felt like the values from the market places at that time just were not compelling so we bought a lot of shares back and have earlier on this year and still have them at pretty decent prices. With the uncertainty that’s in the economy right now we just felt like it was prudent to put that on hold and strengthen our balance sheet with our cash flow.As the financial markets improve and as the economy starts looking a bit better; housing was the first one to go into this dump and usually is the first one to come out of it; so as we start seeing some encouraging signs there hopefully next year we will continue our aggressive share repurchase. But for the time being here we just think it’s prudent to strengthen our balance sheet and therefore reducing debt has come a bit higher up on our priority scale.David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research What would be the likelihood of seeing goodwill impairment at the end of the year?Stephen F. Reeves We do have to measure it every year end. I don’t foresee a challenge on that at this point in time.Operator Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James.Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James I might be rephrasing a little bit what Susan was asking you. You’re forecasting for high single-digit organic declines in the fourth quarter. What are you anticipating sell-through for that assumption? I’m guessing mid-single like perhaps a little bit better than what you’re looking at or how should I look at that?Nolan D. Archibald I think we’re looking at similar or maybe a little bit declining point of sale that we saw in the third quarter which is in the mid-single-digit decline.Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James So no accelerating level of decline from Q3 to Q4?Nolan D. Archibald We don’t anticipate that. We do think and we’ve seen this historically that particularly in times like this that our customers get a little bit more conservative on their inventory positions and as they get near the end of their fiscal year we think they may take their inventories down and therefore we may be a bit more pessimistic in our shipments than we are anticipating with our point of sale.Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James Following up on that, why would pricing improve sequentially? If pricing was down one in this quarter and sell-in and sell-through getting still real difficult, why would pricing improve sequentially on a year-on-year basis?Stephen F. Reeves A couple different factors. We’ve been working through price increases, some of which take effect in October. Some of the pricing negativity in the third quarter related to disposing of excess obsoletes that we took the inventory write-down on in the second quarter so it didn’t read through the gross margins necessarily. It is a little bit of improvement sequentially but it has to do with having achieved certain price increases in certain channels.Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James You mentioned that your expense reduction efforts were better than anticipated broadly. Can you put a little bit of meat on the bone and specifically what areas were better than your expectations and whether they were one off or of a non-recurring nature or whether the reduction efforts would be able to continue?Stephen F. Reeves I think they’ll be able to continue. I think in addition to just cutting back on discretionary spending we’ve been working on some very positive productivity efforts in our distribution network and we saw the benefits of that which should recur going forward.Operator Our next question comes from Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird.Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird I was wondering if we could dig into the European fundamentals a bit more. Maybe if you can give us some color on your comparisons relative to competitors and what you might be doing on the new product front, specifically on that content to help offset what appears to be a rapidly deteriorating end market?Nolan D. Archibald The UK has particularly slowed down as well as most of Western Europe. Germany’s probably holding up the best so far but we’re even starting to see some deterioration there. Fortunately Eastern Europe and Middle East Africa still is pretty good business for us and that’s increasing but as I mentioned in my prepared remarks it’s a smaller base than Western Europe. The UK and France and Italy have all slowed down markedly. We do have excellent new products going in there. I mentioned some in my prepared remarks. We do think new products as well as the margins we get from new products as well as the fact new products seem to sell even in difficult times and therefore we think we’ve got a good product line up going in Europe.Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird I think the trend on the content has been relative share gains on your part. With the down market scenario that we’re under, is it presumably okay to say that you are gaining share relative to the competitors on that continent?Nolan D. Archibald It depends on what you’re talking about. In professional I think we’re still doing pretty darn well. In consumer we have seen this year some real price action by our competitors. We may have lost a bit of share in consumer this year.Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird I know you won’t talk about ’09 but in terms of the economy and the pressure it’s under, can you maybe talk about the leverage that you might have for ’09 if things turn out to be as bad as they look right now?Nolan D. Archibald A couple of things. One is we’re going to continue our aggressive cost actions and look for every opportunity to take costs out. Many of the things that we have done this year particularly in the last six months we’ll be getting more of the benefit next year. We also are going to be seeing a very strong 18-volt platform in cordless and lithium ion. I mentioned in my remarks our XRP in both Ni-CAD and lithium ion. We’ve got a good strong product here next year so we’re hopeful that that will help mitigate some of the stronger headwinds we anticipate.Operator Our next question comes from Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates.Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates I was hoping you could just give us an update on the pension plan just realizing what’s going on in the markets. I think you had been expecting to fund around $30 million or $40 million this year. Just with what’s happened with the assets can you give us an update on any additional cash requirements or what that might mean from a P&L perspective?Stephen F. Reeves Obviously it’s a tough period for the pension. Our measurement date has been moved to December so we haven’t yet set on what the exact funding requirements will be going forward. I really can’t give you any specifics around that.Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates Will it be tied to your cash contributions or tied to the performance of the plan to some degree though?Mark M. Rothleitner You bet. Under both the US and the UK plans, there will be calculations that have to be made at year end and it is probable that funding requirements will go up. Very often they’re on a lagged basis so they may not go up directly in ’09 or maybe only go up a little bit in ’09 and be on a staggered basis. We’ll give you some more color on that in January but you should anticipate given what’s gone on that our funding requirements will go up probably a bit in ’09 and then later in 2010 and beyond.Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates On the commercial paper program I think you’ve got around $200 million out. Given that you’re pulling back on the share repurchases would you prefer to be paid off by the end of the year or as much out of that as you can given that you’ve got the flexibility on cash or are you okay with being outstanding there?Stephen F. Reeves We are okay. The commercial paper market has been open to us the entire time. It has gotten a little bit better in the last few weeks with all of the government programs that have been announced in the last four weeks. So we are comfortable we are able to fund every day and we’ve also been able to take the term out a bit. It was very short term during the peak of the crisis. It’s gotten better. We are comfortable that we’d like to keep that commercial paper program in place and anticipate that we’ll be using it throughout the quarter.Nolan D. Archibald Mark, you might also mention the cash we have offshore too.Mark M. Rothleitner Yes. As you saw on the balance sheet we do have cash offshore. We try not to use it for great lengths of time because of the potential tax consequence of that; however we do use it and can tap into it and in fact most quarter ends we do tap into a good bit of that cash at quarter end to relieve the commercial paper because it gets a little tight. It obviously got very tight at this quarter end so we did avail ourselves of that again this quarter end.Nolan D. Archibald They’ve loosened the restrictions on the amount of time that you can have it over here somewhat also.Mark M. Rothleitner They have indeed. So that should give us a little more flexibility as well in terms of how long we can borrow it and pay down CP with that cash.Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates So the $200 million out on CP at the end of the quarter, right?Mark M. Rothleitner That is correct; however that is a low water mark. Generally it’s a little higher. So our cash flow comes in towards the end of the quarter. That tends to pay it down. If you go back and look at the filings we produce, you’ll see that our average debt is higher than normally our quarter end debt and that’s because we normally do bring cash back at quarter ends to pay down the CP.Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates You mentioned you haven’t repurchased any shares since the beginning of July. Does that mean that there was a little bit this quarter or none at all?Mark M. Rothleitner You’re talking about share repurchase?Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates Yes.Mark M. Rothleitner What happened was just because of the spot date versus the clearing date, we had about 150,000 shares roll into the second quarter that we had actually transacted on before quarter end.Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates What would be embedded for the corporate cost line within your 4Q guidance since it’s a number that bounces around quite a bit?Stephen F. Reeves It’s a continuation of the trends that you have seen through the year-to-date with some favorability in pension, etc. A little bit of the favorability that’s in the third quarter is probably timing so it’ll be a little less favorable in the fourth quarter. [Inaudible] 65 to 70. The full year will probably be closer to the 65 range.Operator There are no further questions at this time. I’ll turn the call back over to Mr. Archibald for any closing remarks.Nolan D. Archibald No closing remarks. Just thank you for joining us and have a good day.Operator This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-07-23 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, my name is Carlie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stanley Works Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Gary Waybright, Stanley Interim Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Greg Waybright: Thanks, Carly. It is actually Greg, but I have been called worse, so, good morning to everyone. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and a special guest Tony Byerly who is the Chief Operating Officer of our North American Convergent Security business. Tony will talk to us about the Sonitrol acquisition during the presentation. There are a few recent press releases that I would like to mention. One relates to our second quarter results, which was issued last night. The others relate to our second-quarter dividend increase which was our 41st consecutive annual increase. The other releases speak to the completion of the Sonitrol and Xmark acquisitions and the announcement naming Bret Bontrager, our Corporate Executive Officer. These releases are available on our website. Today's presentation is also available on our site and we will refer to these charts during the call. John and Jim will review Stanley's second quarter results and Tony as I mentioned will speak to the Sonitrol acquisition, and then we will have a Q&A session. The entire call is expected to last approximately one hour. A replay of the call will be available beginning at 2:00 PM and the replaying number is 800-642-1687 and the access code which is in the press release is 45127121 and please feel free to call me with any questions at 860-827-3544. Just a couple of quick announcements before we proceed. One is a reminder that we issue and update earnings guidance on an annual basis and our press release at the beginning of each quarter and we can not comment on such guidance thereafter. If our guidance changes materially we will issue a press release and conduct a conference call. And secondly another reminder that certain statements made during today's discussion by the various Stanley participants are forward-looking statements. They are based on the assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those that are expected or implied, so we direct you to the cautionary statements in our Form 8-K, which we filed with yesterday's press release and in our current or our recent 34-F filings. I will now turn the call over to John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks Greg, good morning everybody. First just a couple of highlights from a very busy second quarter at Stanley, earnings of a $1.05 were up 4%, excluding the portfolio charges and related business closures that amounted to about $0.10 that were detailed in the press release and set to walk between continued operations... continuing operations and discontinued operations is also contained within the press release. Revenues grew 5% on the basis of currency and acquisitions. We did experience reasonably good organic growth in Europe and in our security business excluding hardware, and we'll come on to that. That was offset by continued weakness in U.S. markets in general and residential construction markets in particularly... in particular. The gross margin was relatively flat consistent with the prior year. We have got good pricing and productivity to offset the inflation as well as the impact of the lower volume. Jim is going to give you a detailed walk, but right now we are estimating 2008 inflation at approximately $150 million for the year and prior to the year beginning that number was between 60 and 80 was our estimate. So that's the magnitude of the increase. We are doing better than in past years in recovering that inflation with price, we are estimating approximately 90% recovery, but that still does leave the gap that we need to fill with productivity improvements in order to ensure that margins don't suffer. Cash flow slightly ahead of prior years excluding the impact of the receivable securitization, facility termination, that was about $17 million understandably unwinding net debt arrangement. CDIY revenue all in was up 4%, Europe was 7% organically. Profit rate was maintained operating margin at 14.6%, and that's despite the inflation and the volume pressure we are experiencing around the world. And within our industrial segment, strong sales growth 12%, if they say security up 7%, profit rated 18.7% excluding hardware, but still quite profitable even including the impact of the lost hardware business was 60 basis point less than 18.1. Looking at the results on the next chart, specifically zeroing in on the earnings picture, virtually all of these number are contained in the press release on a continuing ops basis $0.98 to $0.95 on the basis on which we began the year and provided annual guidance growing a $1.01 up to a $1.05, so a 5% increase on top of a 6% increase in the first quarter. Operating margin down slightly. Tax rate up about 40 basis points, so a little bit of a head wind there and the share count reflects approximately $200 million of buybacks that took place between the fourth quarter '07 and January '08. So all in a 4% improvement in earnings on an apples-to-apples basis, highlighted there in the box as well as outlined in detail in our press release. Looking at revenue, 5% increase primarily in the benefit of acquisitions and foreign exchange. I see revenues that add $1.54 billion, up 58 million. The sources of growth in essence organic was flat as 3% volume declined on a global basis was offset by 3% price improvement; 4% from currency, 1% from acquisitions leading to the 5% that you see in two or three different places. Looking within the segments, organically you see CDI vied down 1% as 4% volume decline is almost fully mitigated by 3% price increase. The total 4% growth of course that's the difference between our organic and FX, which we do not include in our organic growth reporting. Industrial was up 2% organically. Volume flat on a global basis and price 2%, the rest being currency and security down 2% on a comparative basis with volume down 5%, price up 3%. Again importantly we've talked to the hardware. You will recall we discontinued business with one of our larger retail customers that was announced in the second quarter of '07. It will not anniversary until the fourth quarter of '08 and that's about $12.5 million to $15 million a quarter of revenue, negative headwind if you will. Excluding that good solid growth in security totaled 7% of which 4% was organic. Given the magnitude of that number we do think it's important to point it out because it was a conscious decision and a mutual decision with us and the large customer. So simply said, revenues were subdued by weak U.S. market conditions and we were flat in a down market. We think a pretty good accomplishment. Looking on a geographical basis, it's clear from the map that it's a busy chart but we think there is a lot of good important information on it that our diversification and the fact that it is significantly larger percentage of our revenues are out side the U.S. than as little as three years ago is having tremendous benefit. That being said perhaps not the benefit as much benefit as is perceived based on some of the conversations we've had with both analysts and investors in the last several weeks or months. Zeroing on the U.S., middle of the left in total down 2%. This is global Stanley, all businesses and organically down 4%, and that's... represents 56% of Stanley Works total volume. Canada is up 7%; it... sorry it's up 11% in total, organically 1%, and that's all currency... overwhelmingly currency of course and that's represents about 7% of total Stanley revenue. Latin America strong on an organic basis as well as the total basis, it represents only 3% as Stanley's volume, but good volume growth as well as volume growth price achievement in Latin America. Europe, very interesting and I am going to give you a little more granularity in a minute on Europe, but in total up 15%, organically 3%, and that represents about 30% of our total revenues; Asia up 40%, 32% of which is organic of a low base, but we are gaining tremendous traction in the Asian markets in general and Mainland China in particular; and Australia relatively flat on an organic basis down 1%, total up 12% and Australia represents 2% of Stanley's volume. So Europe is about twice as big in terms of absolute terms as it was three years ago and it's growing nicely as well as Latin America and Asia up significantly from a lower base, which is really helping our results and in the sense validating the focus on geographic as well as business mix shift in our portfolio. The next chart is something you haven't seen from us in the past, but recent dialogue that Jim and I and Greg, in fact have had with both analysts and investors is focused a lot on state of the European economy in general as well as our European business in particular. So, we thought it would be helpful to put together this chart or just some information all on one page, and it's virtually all available from public sources. But just starting at the top left, you see the last four quarters of European... Western European GDP growth, that between 2% and 3%. 2.9%, 2.9% falling to 2.5%, following to 2.3%. So not a mediocre decline, but certainly far from robust. The colored chart, if you will are just various geographies, what's shaded in green, call them emerging former Eastern European markets, where GDP growth is above 3%. Those markets in total represent only 3% of Stanley's revenues. The yellow shaded areas are markets that are, I'll say traditional Western European markets with a few exceptions in red that are growing at 1-3% and those markets, as you see them primarily France, Spain, UK, Germany represent about 23% of Stanley's revenues. And they're growing at less than 3% per year in terms of GDP up until most recently. And then the areas in red Hungary, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and others, representing 4% of our revenues are growing at less than 1%. Over on the right, those are not randomly selected. Germany of course is one of the larger economies in Europe but it is not a large contributor to Stanley revenues. Those are Stanley's four largest markets in Europe. Now just take a look at the state of those markets; housing in the UK structured down 27% year-to-date. It's the worst market since 1945. The DIY business, the large home centers varies not dissimilar to the home center businesses in the U.S. are down 3% to 4%. So a third to half the rate that U.S. home centers that are thus far reported are down and auto industrial in the UK are flat to slightly down. In France the economy is holding up better than most western European countries. Construction's solid but it is slowing, DIY down about half the rate of the UK and about a fifth the rate of the U.S. Auto repair flat to down slightly. And industry at this stage remains positive that plus low single digit but its flattening. Italy less healthy with construction down, DIY flat; industrial is flat as well, automotive down about 10%, and I think no surprise that if there was a construction boom in Europe, most of it was in the south western part of Europe, particularly Spain. Construction permits are down 44% year-to-date in Spain. Automotives down as well GDP basically flat. So simply said the thought of European markets being buoyant is anything but true. They have been relatively soft, although not as soft as the U.S. for the last six to nine months and we are faring fairly well in those conditions. The next chart is a look at the Stanley business within Europe that we thought would be helpful to overlay one on the other. This is information we normally wouldn't provide on a call or wouldn't get into this level of detail but we think there is enough diversity of opinion out in the world in terms of how we are doing in Europe, relative to the rest of the world and how important Europe is. We put it on our two quarter rolling average basis just to take some of the lumpiness out of the numbers. On the left is total Europe and if you go back to third quarter '06 or fourth quarter '06, you see high... mid-to-high single digit volume growth in the black and prices being relatively flat. Of late you see that the volume growth is flat and it hasn't gone negative, but it's basically zero or flat with price offsetting some of the volume declines or the volume flattening. So as an example, in the most recent quarter volume and total up to two-tenths of 1%, price up 1.3% that would translate on that basis to 1.5% growth. A subset of total Europe is to the right, which is European construction, CDIY and you see the volatility. If you go back to the same time period, high single or low double digit volume growth, flat pricing has since turned to negative volume growth although low single digits mitigated by some price. So an obvious question is how and why have we held up in market conditions that I think are far less robust than perhaps is the perception. There were a lot of factors going on, first and foremost new product innovation continues to accelerate, simultaneous introduction of products on a global basis instead of Europe trailing the U.S. by six to nine months has had a tremendous is that a tremendous impact. We continue to support our brand in all major markets. Facom had its new catalog in March '08, that has been very well received, celebrating the 90-year anniversary of the company. And there are revenue synergies from the Facom acquisition that are now fully embedded. We have had two and half years of collaboration among the legacy Stanley and Facom teams; they are all under one management team in one place. And that too is having an impact relative to the conditions out there. So our conclusion is continuing to operate well in a weakening market that may get weaker, that being said, we want to make it very, very clear, the European market relative to history has been anything but robust in the last six months. Let's go back to a more traditional look if you will at our segments the way that we've typically talked to you about them on this call. Most of this has been said. Construction in DIY revenues are up 4% driven by Europe. You see the operating margins flat and our segment profit up $3 million or 4% in absolute terms. Sales up 4% outside the U.S.; you saw that on the maps on chart 5. U.S. is obviously impacted by the weak residential construction market although we're encouraged by the results given the volume softness within the U.S. retail channel. We are clearly gaining share as our volume is down about one-third or less the level of the market in general, and that's just simple arithmetic. We know we're gaining shares of consequence. And encourage that the segment profit rate is held at 14.6% despite the significant inflation and volume pressure. Jim is going to show you some numbers and be a little more granular on what's in our press release. But that number has gone up to about 150 million annually. About two thirds of Stanley's inflation always is steel and about two-thirds of our inflation is in the... the steel inflation is in the construction in DIY segment. So this segment holding a 14.6 given the magnitude of inflation in general, steel inflation in particular, and the high steel content within the Bostitch business to consumer tools and storage business is a good achievement in terms of both product innovation mix upgrades and price recovery. Moving on to industrial, double digit revenue growth would actively extend at the expense of 220 basis points of margin. Simply said industrial and automotive tools revenues did grow 10%, 1% of which was organic from a very large business there in Europe and a lot of currency effect. Facom continues to do extremely well; revenue is up 20% and 4% organically certainly inline with the market if not slightly ahead. So we continue to be pleased with the performance of that business and the Americas down. Engineered solutions were up 20%, more than half of that is from the recent Innerspace acquisition that we have talked about. That's our intelligent part focused on healthcare channels. Solid organic growth and the remainder of the engineered storage business specifically Vidmar, the hydraulics business remains strong in terms of volume and Assembly Tech is holding pretty well given its focus in automotive. Segment profit is down, steel inflation, product mix, as well strategic investments and just to give you a little more light on that proto and hydraulics in particular within these segment extraordinary high steel content. They will behind through the third quarter and we can catch up by the fourth quarter in terms of ability to recover via pricing the steel inflation that they've absorbed. And we continue to invest in emerging markets in our industrial channels both in the Mid-East as well as Asia. It's an engine on a platform for future growth. And we think this is... would be the worst time to take off the accelerator in those markets. Last, but not... certainly not least is security. What it shows you on a total basis is revenue is up 1%. That being said, 7% without the hardware headwind that we talked about. Segment profits flat on a similar basis as well as the profit rate, flat without hardware, down 60 basis points including the loss of the hardware business. We're very pleased with the performance of the Convergent Security business and just to refresh everyone's memory that's the legacy systems integration business at Stanley, it's HSM on international basis, it is the Blick business in the UK, the Frisco Bay business in Canada, and this is where Sonitrol will fit and Tony will talk to you about that a little later on in the presentation. Net sales growth up 9%, 5% of which was organic. We're getting operating leverage that we'd hoped for with HSM. And a greater importance to this is our U.S. systems integration margins continue to expand from the successful reverse integration of the legacy Stanley SI business into HSM. Mechanical access which consist of our access technologies business, mechanical and electro-mechanical locking, personal security which is our senior technologies in Bedcheck [ph] business as well as builder's hardware up 6%, 2% organically excluding the hardware and this quarter was about 18 million down due primarily to the loss of the business and a large retailer that as I said early will anniversary in the fourth quarter. And if nothing else the comps will get easier but maintaining that business where it is in light of that orchestrated withdrawal from about $50 million on an annual basis piece of business is holding up pretty well. Profit remains high at 18.7%, extra hardware but I don't think we need to apologize for 18.1% as stated and as reported. Now working capital management and cash generation remain a focus particularly in this environment and we're making progress in both areas. I'm going to turn it over to Jim who's going to take you through some of that as well as talk to you about our look going forward for the rest of the year.
James M. Loree: Okay, thank you John. First of all inventories were a great story with an 8 day decrease in light of the volume issues; the physical volume reductions that we are encountering which we will talk about in a few minutes. It's really difficult to bring inventories down like that and it can't be done in a haphazard way that's to be done through process and methodical process improvements and that's exactly what's going on with the Stanley fulfillment system as it relates to inventories. So we can look for more progress in inventories as the year goes on and I think that will continue to be a good story. Receivables were up quite a bit and 12% to be specific. We are not terribly concerned about that because the vast majority of that was related to... in the administrative calendar, a calendar issue which had to do with where the month closed and that should take care of itself by the fourth quarter, may continue into the third quarter, but should be out of that by the fourth quarter. So receivables, we have no material delinquency creep that we have analyzed very carefully and haven't... don't have any real issue there, and payables continues to be a very good story. So we are able to improve the turns from 4.5 to 4.8, and we expect to close out the year well over five turn, so good progress there. The cash flow and the company's cash generating capability continues to be an excellent story with good solid cash flow for the quarter. It would have been even better had it not been for the fact that we terminated a $17 million receivable, securitization facility, and no longer need that facility given that we have $800 million in liquidity outlines out there right now, so we decided... left to determinate that cost of $17 million in the quarter. But we continue to believe that receivables will generate cash in 2008. So on a year-to-date basis, we are at about $138 million of free cash flow compared with 152 last year, down 14. If you take way the effect of the terminated facility in effect, we are tracking to last year's levels, which is we are very high or highest ever. Moving onto price and inflation; this has been a really incredible phenomenon in 2008 like nothing we have seen since John and I have been here. It's certainly probably hard to inspect the 70s, when we as a country experienced this kind of inflation. Our estimate started the year if you recall back at the February analyst meeting, we indicated that we thought inflation would be about $75 million. Today that number is 2X the 75, and basically at $150 million. We could have had a $0.70 per share negative impact from that inflation had we not responded in a very crisp, robust way. So our price recovery continues to highlight the company's strong inflation forecasting and also just price recovery discipline. And you can see that we are expecting to recover 80% back in the initial timeframe. We upgraded that to 90% on last earnings call. And we still, despite the fact that we are going to have $150 million of inflation, we still believe that we will recover 90%. We've already taken most of the actions that are required to accomplish that. And in this environment, you really need a robust price recovery mechanism in order to preserve the margins and the latest culprit in the inflationary trend area is not surprisingly steel, and the steel companies have gotten very aggressive with tearing up contracts and not honoring commitments and so forth, resin, purchased products also factors. But now steel is really the big culprit there. Moving onto guidance, the 2008 guidance that we issued in January of 420-440 assumed organic sales of roughly flat to up 1% and price about $60 million which was near 80% of the 75 million inflation that I just talked about. So price would have been about a point of sales, 1.2% to be exact. So at the time in order to get to 0% to 1% organic sales, we were assuming that physical volume would be essentially down a point roughly and I will come back to that in a minute. If we take now the effect of the discontinued operations which primarily involve the sale of CST, but also some smaller product lines totaling about $60 million which we announced in mid-June as well as the recently closed Sonitrol acquisition which has a $0.02 dilutive effect in 2008. On an adjusted basis that guidance would look more like 410 to 430. Now as we indicated in the last call, we were suspecting that the second half economic environment could be difficult and it certainly has fulfilled that expectation. So we put in place a contingency plan which provided for $0.20 benefit in '08, net of $15 million of restructuring and as it turns out, the volume impact is now going to be about $0.50 a share which is what we suggested it might be last time, if the economic difficulties were to continue. So we've implemented those contingency plans subsequent to the last conference call and as a result of that proactive action are able to preserve the earnings base. So the 3.90 that you see here relates to $3.88 continuing operations number for last year and we now believe that organic growth will be down 1%, but the fact that the price is now up about two points, really means that volume is down 3 to 4 points. So the physical volume impact from the recessionary conditions in some of our markets is really severe and I would like to think in terms of the ability to draw down inventory with a 3% to 4% reduction and still preserve an earnings base. It means that there is a lot of good work going on in the productivity area in the company as well. We'll move on now to significant 2Q events. Pleased to announce that the Brett Bontrager, our Vice President of Business development and our President of our Stanley Convergent Security Solutions was named an Executive Officer by our Board that press release as Greg mentioned had been issued and we congratulate Brett on that achievement. We also agreed to sell our CST/Berger Laser leveling and measuring unit which was about 80 million in revenues. We announced that in mid-June, hope to close that shortly, next couple of weeks. We were able to achieve a selling price of $205 million and we also at that same time announced plans to divest about $60 million in revenue of some smaller non-strategic businesses during the year. And worthy of note, the CST/Berger business have become non-strategic, because it was getting... it had a competitors from the high-end that were coming down and competitors from the low-end that were kind of coming up; it was in the middle. When we bought that company back in 2004, we were envisioning that it could become a growth platform if we were able to acquire some of the other companies on the higher-end. As it turned out for various reasons, none of those were available for acquisition and we were really left with no degrees of freedom. So the decision to sell that business was made this year, and we were able to achieve a very healthy $205 million for something we paid about $64 million, four years ago. We also announced the acquisition of Xmark for approximately $50 million. It's located in Ottawa, Canada. It develops and markets RFID based systems to identify and protect people on assets in the healthcare market. Its principal products focus on infant protection in hospitals and wander protection for Alzheimer's patients and the like. As many of you know, we have a small kind of fledgling business, but extremely a high growth and profitable business in the security segment that specializes in healthcare type security like this. And then we also announced the acquisition of Sonitrol for $276 million. A very exciting and meaningful acquisition, and as Greg mentioned, we have Tony Byerly, COO of the North American Convergent Security business here to share some highlights. Tony would you please talk about Sonitrol?
Tony Byerly: Thanks Jim. As Jim mentioned, these are exciting times in electronic security industry. I have been in the security industry for nearly 20 years, and I have seen only a handful of industry defining moments. One such moment began roughly one and a half years ago with the acquisitions of HSM by the Stanley Works and then combining of it with the Stanley System's integration business creating Stanley Convergent Security Solutions. That moment really has fully evolved now with the Sonitrol acquisition. The combining of Stanley CSS with Sonitrol creates the third largest electronics security monitoring company in the U.S. based on total revenue. Now Sonitrol will help both the direct and the franchise network go-to-market approach also about 125,000 customers and Sonitrol is best know for its industry leading audio verification technology; and as a result, reports the industry's highest apprehension rates and lowest dispatch and false alarm rates making it a law enforcement trend. Sonitrol's revenue is broken down by 53% coming from monitoring and service, 34% from installation, 8% from equipment and product sales, and 5% franchise growth. The combining of Staley CSS and Sonitrol not only creates a third largest overall provider as I mentioned, but also solidifies Stanley CSS as the second largest commercial security monitoring provider. Now the company reports $110 million in total revenues and through its audio verification technology reports one of the most stable customer bases in the industry with low attrition rates and an average customer life of 12 years. There are numerous strategic benefits to the Sonitrol acquisition. First it increases the overall CSS global platform to over 700 million and the Stanley Security solutions platform to over 1.6 billion. As previously reported the acquisition will be $0.02 dilutive in 2008 as Jim mentioned, $0.04 accretive in 2009 increasing by an incremental $0.05 each year thereafter. There are also numerous similarities between the two businesses. Both are commercially focused. Both drive an RMR, a reoccurring revenue business model, both are known for quality and high customer satisfaction and both have a solid national account program. The acquisition certainly brings increased skills of operations in national accounts towards the organization overall. In addition this allows us to really focus in on specific vertical markets for example the education market. Sonitrol is a leader in the K through 12 market and Stanley Securities Solutions is well positioned in the higher education market. Now in addition to Sonitrol's audio verification and intrusion alarms which they are very well known for, the company also offers a full range of suite of services as well as security systems including access control, video surveillance or CCTV, fire alarm detection and other security equipment products such as video monitoring and online access control management. Now with the close of Sonitrol behind us on Friday and as with previous D&A acquisitions, the integration is already in progress and has been carefully planned. I am very pleased to have Todd Leggett, who is actually Sonitrol's former Senior Vice-President of operations to join our team as our Vice-President, General Manager of Sonitrol operation. Todd has a considerable amount of experience in the industry and specifically at Sonitrol. Now joining Todd and leading our integration efforts will be Jim Coplain, [ph] who is one of our most seasoned leaders and who has a considerable amount of acquisition simulation experience as well. Of course Todd and Jim are joined by the entire team and we'll go through the many years of experience on this call. We don't have the time. But all integration activities will be carefully monitored and controlled and we're excited to have Sonitrol as part of the Stanley's CSS platform. I'm going to turn back to Jim. He's going to talk about transition.
James M. Loree: Thank you, Tony. We're pleased to have Tony and his team in-charge of integrating Sonitrol. They did a great job with the reverse integration of HSM. So the same team that led that. Now working the Sonitrol acquisition and we're looking forward to great results there. As we look at the portfolio transition, this is truly remarkable metamorphosis over the last few years, from '02 to '08, where with $2.6 billion company with 65% of our revenues in construction and DIY in 2002, with the largest customer totaling 22% of our revenues. By last year, we had built the security business up to about 31% of the total revenues, construction DIY was down to 40%, and industrial had grown to 29%, and we were $4.5 billion. So close to double in size. And then as we now adjust for the divestiture of CST and the acquisitions of Sonitrol and Xmark, you can see that the various portfolio moves that we announced in the last quarter have had a notable effect on the portfolio composition. So you can see the security business would now account for about 35% of the revenues, rapidly approaching the size of the construction and DIY business, which is 37%; and of course the industrial is roughly the same. So in general, continued progress in the tough environment... tough operating environment, but some of the challenges in this environment are also creating opportunities for us, and we continue to take advantage of those. Just a very, very brief refresher on the growth platforms. We continue to allocate our capital into three... our three major growth platforms industrial and automotive tools, mechanical security, and convergent security. So here you've seen a number of acquisitions that are more focused on the convergent business in the last year or so, but would not be at all surprised to see some progress in one or two of these other growth platforms over the next coming months. And I'll wrap it up now. We took a little bit longer than we usually do with the overview, where we had a lot of content. Needless to say, the inflationary conditions have accelerated. We've implemented the strong recovery actions, price management we talked about the rigorous process that we have enabling 90% recovery. Good news also is that we are able to recover price in CDIY much more effectively than we have in past years. We are looking to recover close to 80% this year of our inflation in construction and DIY. So, with the Chinese inflation and so forth have helped that out, and competitive dynamics are such that that we are able to do that. We will encounter a lag in the price inflation recovery in the third quarter. So for those folks that are modeling, please factor that in. We've quantified that in the press release, so that should be easy to do. We're also going to provide a schedule for those of you, who are interested later today that will break out the quarters for '07 on a recast basis, which will reflect the discontinued operations. So, I will caveat that by saying that that will change from quarter-to-quarter here, and we will continue to provide that on an ongoing basis this year. It will change as some of the $60 million transactions that we talked about are close than they actually are removed from continuing operations. So it will be a challenge to keep up with it, but we'll will provide as much information as possible to make it easy. The markets themselves are offering no sign of rebound, we talked the length about that. So the organic growth forecast is now down 1% to 2% for the year. The volume was even steeper volume decreased. John talked at length about Europe. Contingency cost actions have been implemented. We expect to be able to preserve our earnings and cash flow base amidst these weak markets and we absolutely should be well positioned for a successful '09 regardless of what the conditions might be with strong price momentum with carry over from the cost reduction actions coming into '09. The hardware loss will anniversary in the middle of the fourth quarter and we will have a substantial amount of restructuring in the base... in the '08 base, and the Stanley fulfillment system is gaining traction. So, as I said a minute ago, we are taking advantage of the market conditions performing well, but also taking advantage of this opportunity to advance the portfolio. And we will turn it over for Q&A at this point.
Greg Waybright: ey Carlie, at this time, we will turn it back to you for the Q&A session. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Peter Lisnic with Robert Baird.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. It's actually John on for Pete. Can you guys just talk about with M-CSS, the 5% organic growth was recurring revenue kind of growing at that rate also and kind of as a reverse integration that you've done, is that fully impact now?
John F. Lundgren: Yeah. John, this is John; I'll take it although. Tony could probably take it even better. The simple answer is yes; the percentage of recurring revenue was actually increasing although that's what we modeled. As you'll recall HSM recurring revenue was dramatically higher than the Legacy Convergent Stanley business. So in total, the weighted average is increasing and in fact the percent of the proportions, excuse me, of reoccurring is increasing a little faster than the rates in general. At this stage, 18 months in, it's a little premature to declare victory, but all I can say is we are pleased beyond our initial expectations and we were cautiously or highly optimistic upon acquiring HSM. The team is still in place, and I think the best indication to that is we've just gone and made another $275 million acquisition in similar space and empowered the HSM team and former HSM team and Brett Bontrager to integrate that business. And without over simplifying, the process worked extraordinarily well with HSM, and Tony and his team along with Todd Leggett from Sonitrol, who is an industry veteran, we hope to apply the exact same type of methodology with Sonitrol and get the same kind of initial success and maintain the momentum as we did with HSM.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and then my follow up; just the free cash flow generation has stayed really strong kind of relative to everything else. What are your uses of kind of that free cash flow looking forward?
James M. Loree: Well it... as we have said all along historically two-thirds of our free cash flow has gone to strategic acquisitions, one-third has been returned to the shareholders and equally split between dividends and buy backs. Going forward, you could expect that to continue. I mean we think Stanley stock is a good buy right now. That being said that's a one time opportunity and it doesn't advance our portfolio strategically. The acquisition pipeline is robust with strategic acquisitions within the reach of our own cash flows. You'll recall we did announce a modest increase to our dividend the 41st consecutive year. So I think it is fair to say $500 million in cash flow on an ongoing basis going forward. I think the two thirds of it will be used for strategic acquisitions and a third will be returned to the shareholders primarily via dividend, opportunistic buyback when and if the pipelines are not full or we feel that our stock is so depressed, while it is not strategically advancing our portfolio, it's the best short term use of cash.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Lucas with Janney Montgomery.
James Lucas: Thanks, good morning guys.
James M. Loree: James good morning.
James Lucas: Impressed with the good color on the conference call today. Two questions. One, on the industrial margins. Could you give us a little bit more color on how much of that is the pricing gap versus mix and any additional color specifically on the mix. And secondly just following up on the last question about the cash flow usage on the robust acquisition pipeline. Can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the various growth platforms. What type of... where may be any type of color that you can give on the tools versus security what you are seeing out there and domestic versus international?
John F. Lundgren: Sure, Jim will... Jim will take both of those, Jim and I'll add on it if need be.
James M. Loree: We are looking for international acquisitions in the security business there with some success in the pipeline. And as far as the tool industry, the tool industry is supposed to consolidate at some point in time. I have being waiting nine years since I have been here for it to happen. I would suggest that this maybe a fairly opportune time for that, simply because of the stresses and pressures on the cash flow and the earning statements of certain tool companies that are sort of in the middle. Similar to how we were with CST. They're not private label and they're not the world's best brand at hand tool company, they are somewhere in between and they are getting squeezed. So there's some of that going on and I suspect this industry will likely consolidate at some point in time and I don't know whether it will be this year but if it does, we'll be in a good position to be a participant in that. So that's really the growth platforms. As far as the industrial profit margin of 220 basis points, I'd say it's about a third of each. I mean the strategic investments where we did a fairly substantial amount of consulting work in product simplification and complexity reduction to help us with our inventory reduction in a Stanley Fulfillment Systems initiatives, and that was about a third of the issue and then product mix is, we're finding particularly in the automotive repair business in industrial, a little more tendency to avoid the big ticket items and of course the financing state of the financing markets hasn't helped since many of those credits that when they sell tool boxes and so forth to end users are... they tend to be sub prime or close to sub prime in nature and the availability of financing is constrained at this time obviously. So, there tends to some of the higher margin storage type business in the automotive repairs is being stressed a little bit. And we just add some other mix issues here and there throughout the portfolio in industrial but are probably less structural and it's temporary in nature. And then the other third is this price gap that you talked about when you end up with... and the industrial business in particular; they tend to be on a little slower pace as far as the industry goes, recovering price because they have catalogs and things like that. That's all changing in this environment but sometimes it takes a little time to change behavior patterns and so our businesses are working hard to change those patterns and they range from businesses like hydraulics, which I think is implemented something like 6 price increases this year to proto which has implemented 1 and is now about to implement another one and everything in between. But with the recent spike in inflation they got caught little bit more than the other businesses with unanticipated, unrecovered inflation but it will be temporary.
James Lucas: And back to your acquisition commentary. Have you seen any changes in the multiples out there or was it still that sellers premium that's out there?
James M. Loree: No Jim since... glad you asked. I was going to add on time permitting. The good assets, obviously there is very little private equity competition for those assets. That being said, there has been very little price capitulation on the good assets. I think it would be a tough time to sell poorly performing assets or assets without a great growth profile or opportunity for growth with some synergies, but if you look at businesses that we've just sold as well as businesses that we've acquired, the numbers aren't crazy, but the good businesses continue to sell at a rich premium reflecting their growth and income potential, and I think as long as those are the types of businesses being sold that's our expectation for the next 6 to 12 months. Full and fair prices for the good assets.
James Lucas: Okay. Thanks again for the color today.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan.
Michael Rehaut: Hi, good morning.
James M. Loree: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Rehaut: The first question just on the raw material and offsetting actions; if the raw materials were to sort of stabilize here, which unfortunately doesn't look likely, but what would that 150 be in terms of carry over into '09. And am I to assume also that the actions that you've taken, you are expecting an incremental 40 million benefit on the cost savings?
John F. Lundgren: Yeah. Want to try? What was the second part of the question?
James M. Loree: The 40--
Michael Rehaut: Is this the offsetting... what would flow through on the raw material side?
John F. Lundgren: Yeah, we've been playing catch up; when you are chasing inflation, you are playing catch up. So if inflation stops, price exceeds inflation when it stops. So we are not the... the cost actions are not for price recovery. And you are right, it's a hypothetical question, because in reality, we are not expecting the inflation to stop, and we are not expecting our price actions to stop as inflation increases. So it's very hypothetical. What we are girding against with these cost actions is a continuation of an economic slow down. And we don't know whether that's going to happen just like we didn't know whether the second half was going to be as bad as it is, but we are prepared with a $40 million carryover and $30 million of restructuring in the 2007 base, which we may or may not use next year depending on circumstances. We are prepared to weather whatever kind of storm comes our way with quick solid earrings and cash flow performance.
Michael Rehaut: Okay. And just I guess secondly, where would you expect over the next two, three years to see your product mix continue to go? I mean would you see security getting up into the... in the 40s? How would you think about consumer DIY? Are you comfortable at the size it is today or do you think you can see that shrink a little further?
John F. Lundgren: Yeah, I guess it depends on whether it's an absolute terms, Mike or as percent of total. As Jim showed, when we call--
Michael Rehaut: Percent of total.
John F. Lundgren: Yeah, I understood. As we closed '07, we're going to be close to a third of third of third. That was our interim objective. We said for a long time we'd like security to be 50% of the total in five years. That's probably slowed down a little bit. We said that three years ago and we continue to grow. Our objective with CDIY, with the sales of CST, there are two good businesses within CDIY and they are big. We think we can grow them organically at a rate slightly above the market, keep them at about the 1.7 billion, where they are currently growing at low to mid single digits, which means they will decline as a percent of total. We don't have a problem with CDIY businesses in general, it's the home center dependency we are trying to stay away from. So if I had to speculate, they... you said two to three years, they probably could go down to as low as 25% of the business while the combination of security and industrial would be 75 with security growing at a little faster rate than industrial borrowing any of the major consolidations that Jim talked about.
Michael Rehaut: Okay, great.
John F. Lundgren: We don't want to shrink any of our businesses in absolute terms however. Jeff Ansell's team is doing a great job growing a CDIY businesses with innovation, mix, and pricing in a market that's down high single or low double digits.
Michael Rehaut: Okay, great.
Operator: And your next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is open. If your line is on mute please unmute your line. There is no response from Eric's line. We'll continue with the next question from Nigel --
James M. Loree: We will try someone else, we'll go back to him later.
Operator: Okay. Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst: I have some questions on Nigel's behalf. Within CDIY, I was hoping you could give some color on Bostitch and the consumer tool business.
James M. Loree: What you are looking for related to Bostitch and consumer tools?
Unidentified Analyst: Just some additional color on how those business are performing.
John F. Lundgren: They are both performing consistent with expectations. In fact consumer tools and storage is performing maybe better than we would expect given the market. And Bostitch is about where we hoped it would be. It's a little bit frustrating, but not discouraging. Specifically we've taken $50 million worth of cost out of the Bostitch business. We've inherited... we've absorbed a lot of inflation. We've got almost $50 million of prize with the Bostitch business to do and in doing all that margins have remained about where they were in the last two quarters. We need little bit of help from the market place on Bostitch to get margins back up to the high single low double digits, where it's been historically and where is our target. But if there is a perception that Bostitch is losing money, it's simply not the case. It's making money, its making money in the low single digit operating income for couple of quarters in a row. Doing a great job internally with price, manufacturing restructuring, and tremendous SG&A constraint weathering a market that's down. About 50% of the Bostitch business is CDIY and 50% is industrial. Neither of which are terribly strong and about 25% of the Bostitch business is outside the U.S., that business is very healthy. So Bostitch is running really-really hard to stay in place and with a little bit more pricing which the market, I think is ready for and a little bit of help through the market, I think we will get it back to where we want it to be and where it rightfully should be at this stage of the process.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and then going to the restructuring, where specifically are you guys looking to restructure?
James M. Loree: Well restructuring is broad based. It means marginal facilities, SG&A cuts people not as opposed to spending for which we reserve. It's pervasive across the company. Obviously we would across all businesses across the company. Obviously we do less restructuring and our highest potential growth there is for fear of cutting that growth. So basically what it is, is getting certain businesses that are facing marketplace headwinds downsized so their infrastructure is more in line with the reduced size of the business and that applies to every business in Stanley whose volumes and revenues aren't up.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay great. And then one last quick one if you don't mind, are you guys currently paying full spot prices for steel?
James M. Loree: No. We'd like to think with our global sourcing capabilities we're at or below market but it depends on what one does call... what one is establishing and agreeing to be the spot price. We'd like to think we're doing a good job leveraging our global sourcing capabilities. What we do know is our prices are going up as fast as everyone else's, its just from which base we are talking. So the magnitude of the increase from the base is unprecedented. We would like to think we are paying a little bit below full spot prices because we are buying ahead to the extent we can and that has given us a bit of benefit.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anna Stromberg with NAV Capital. I am sorry; the next question comes from Ted Hover [ph] with Stanopoint [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Just going back to the cost recovery question. I guess I wanted to, I don't know if you would actually kind of break this out but what percent of your cost inflation is primarily attributable to steel. Just trying to get a sense so we can kind of see what's going on with steel price.
John F. Lundgren: Yeah.
Unidentified Analyst: And how much is actually driving that and my second kind of... second... my follow up question would be what type of price recovery do you need to get across your product line to be able to get your targeted 9% price recovery?
James M. Loree: Well, the second one is going to be very difficult to answer, the first one is easy; I talked to it earlier. Roughly, two-thirds of all of our inflation is steel, the rest in order of descending priority is resin, nonferrous metals, and of course there is no... there is little bit more stability in non-ferrous metals right now and steel, last year nonferrous metals in fact were greater, cause of inflation and steel. So roughly two thirds of our cost inflation is steel, followed by resin, nonferrous metals and then various other inputs. What kind of price we have to get, I mean it's simply arithmetic, it's 90% of our $150 million is about $135 million, you need 135 million on a $4 billion revenue base. So globally across Stanley that's 3% to 4% on an annualized basis for the year. That's going to vary dramatically by business where some are up 20 and some are flat. But simply said, we need $135 million on $4.5 billion, which is 3% to 4% on an annual basis with tremendous discrepancies or variations across the Stanley businesses. I hope that answers your question; if not, for more granularity, Greg can walk you through that offline.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks.
Operator: And this concludes the Q&A session for today's call. John, do you have any closing remarks?
John F. Lundgren: This obviously was a very busy quarter. And we feel good about the results given the environment that's out there. We've got a lot of work to do on pricing. We think we have the right people in place to do it. And borrowing any major news, we will talk to you again on October. Thanks for your interest this morning.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-04-25 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Sierra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Stanley Works first quarter results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. John Lundgren, Stanley Works Chairman and CEO. Sir you may begin your conference.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks Sierra. Good Morning. Just before the cautionary statements and proceedings with this mornings call, we have a brief announcement regarding investor relations at Stanley, which you may have seen this morning. Gerry Gould, who is Stanley's Vice President Investor Relations and has been for the last 11 year's has expected a position as the Vice President of investor relations for RSC Equipment Rentals Scottsdale, Arizona. And, simply we want to thank Gerry for obviously his many years of diligent service, valuable contributions to the company. Of course, we wish him well. We know he will enjoy the sun and do a really good job for RSC. And with us today is Greg Waybright who is our Vice President of Internal Audit. Greg is also going to be serving as our Interim Vice President of Investor Relations as we completed search of Gerry's replacement. So Greg, I will turn it over to you for the cautionary statements.
Greg Waybright: Great thanks John and good morning to everyone. On the call in addition to myself and John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO is the Jim Loree, our Executive VP and CFO as well as Jerry Gould. And there are few recent press releases that I would like to mention. One relates to our first quarter results, which was issued earlier this morning, and the other is related to our second quarter dividend declaration and the results of our annual shareholders meeting, which were issued yesterday and these press releases are available on our website. Today's presentation is also available on our site. And as that's important as we refer to these charge during the call. John will review Stanley's first quarter results followed by a Q&A session. The call is expected as usual to last approximately one hour. And then a replay of the call will be available beginning at 00:02.pm today through Wednesday, April 30th. The replay number is 800-642-1687 and the access code is 42633122. And you can also call me with any questions. My number is 860-827-3544 and I look forward to speaking with some of you as part of mine Interim Investors Relations role with Stanley. So, two quick announcements before we proceed with John's comments, both reminders, one being that we issue an update our earnings guidance on an annual basis in our press release at the beginning of each quarter and we cannot comment on such guidance there after. If the guidance does change materially, we will issue a press release and conduct the conference call. And then secondly, the obligatory, cautionary statement language being that certain statements made during today's discussion by the various Stanley participants are forward-looking statements. They are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. As such they involve risks and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those expected or implied. So, we direct you to the cautionary statements in Form 8-K, which we filed with today's press release and then our recent 34 Act filings. I'll now turn the call over to, John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Greg. I'm going to go through a brief and call it formal presentation of the results. Jim and I often share this. Jim is here with us today, it's relatively short. So I'll take us through the entire presentation to allow us plenty of time for questions and answers. In summarizing, the first quarter business highlights, 6% earnings growth which led to 85% earnings per share, despite the difficult market conditions particularly in the North American residential construction business. Our revenues were up 3%. Certainly they were aided by our foreign currency translation and acquisitions, which did more than offset the softness in organic volume. We grew our gross margin by 60 basis points as a percentage of revenues, as our productivity programs in the plants and good work in the market place on freights realization more than offset the inflation, excellent quarter in terms of cash flow of $83 million up 22% over the first quarter of '07. As you would expect, the CDIY revenue was flat as the currency offsets in foreign markets compensated for the weakness in demand in North America. But in the industrial segment both profits and revenues were up 8%. I will talk more about that in our segment detail. And an outstanding quarter in security with our profits up 17% on revenue growth of 3%, again more detail on that in the segments. So looking quickly at the first quarter results in total, we see net earnings flat at $68 million, which translated the EPS of $0.85. Interest expense, tax rate, share count, tax rate is 70 basis points lower than the same period year ago, all contributed to the increase in earnings. So 6% earnings growth despite relatively difficult North American market conditions. Now, looking a little more closely at revenues and the sources of growth, as previously stated revenues up 3%, unit volume across the globe was down 5%, offset by 2%price realization, which lead to the previously stated minus 3% organic growth. We got a 4% less from currency, as you know about 45% of Stanley's revenues are outside North America and another 2% from the annualized effective acquisitions that one part of our portfolio in the first quarter last year leading to the revenue growth of about 3%. By segment, and we'll get into more detail on this, CDIY as previously stated was flat. Organic growth on a global basis was minus 5%. And, as I stated earlier, currency and price offset the unit volume softness, which was overwhelmingly concentrated in North America. The industrial segment grew 8% in total and was down 1% organically. Lot of moving pieces there, but Europe was strong. Our Engineered Solutions business was strong and of course we were helped by foreign exchange, offset by weakness in North American automotive and repair segment, and lot of things driving that and we'll talk about that more in the segment detail. Two small acquisitions, both notable of which was InnerSpace contributed in addition to the FX to the total growth. Last, but certainly not least, security which was up 3% in total, down 2% organically, but that's a tremendous achievement, and I'll talk about it more in the segment when you think about the fact we offset a 4% to 5% headwind due to the loss of a major customer in North America, which was announced this time last year, but the volume didn't disappear from our P&L until the middle of the third quarter. So as you see, 3% organic growth in the total security segment excluding hardware. Let's look briefly at the three segments, starting with construction in DIY. As I say, flat revenues, in those, in both the consumer tools and storage and our Bostitch business were basically flat. Segment profit down 19% in absolute returns and 280 basis points. The U.S continues to be adversely impacted by the residential construction market. That of course affects consumer tools and storage as well as Bostitch. In North America those businesses were both down low single digits in terms of revenue. Sales in the rest of the world were up 6%. Of course a lot of that was foreign currency, Europe up about 7% in the consumer tools and storage business and Bostitch up even more than that in Europe. So, relatively good performance outside the U.S. The profit rate of course is negatively impacted as we failed to fully recover inflation, about $20 million of the annualized inflation came out us in February and we absorbed some of that in the cost line and didn't yet recover it with price and productivity. The soft volume resulted in lower absorption of fixed cost, and we did continued spending on market development. We made our commitment early in the year to continue to support our brand in consumer tools and storage, as well as fully implement and retain our discovery team activities, and if appropriate as suggested in our guidance, we'll reduce those slightly to preserve earnings later in the year, but that money is committed. We thought it was money well spent and we continue to believe it will strengthen us for the future going forward. Just a brief note, we talked earlier about anti-dumping tariffs, and the impact that had on our Bostitch business. In the short term, it's neutral, neither positive nor negative. In the long-term, we think it's an advantage for Bostitch. You may recall in January of 2008, tariffs has a range between 4% and 118%, were imposed on all imports from China as a result of a lot of study and the fact that the conclusion that certain fastening products were being dumped in the U.S at unfair prices. The total impact on Bostitch was 19%, which was well below a lot of the competition and it of course just reflected the product mix of Bostitch. And, going forward it will level the playing field against any relative to Chinese imports that were being dumped. Short-term, any one the increases have been passed along in terms of pricing because it's affecting everyone. Long-term, we think it's an advantage for Bostitch and the Bostitch has very capable production facilities in North America, as well as in Poland, as well as in China, near Beijing. So, good production on three continents gives us the flexibility to move production going forward as exchange rates and market conditions vary. Looking at the industrial segment, as I said revenues and segment profit both up 8%. Profit rate was flat. Industrial tools and automotive repair tool revenues were up 6%, down 2% organically. Facom continues to perform well, and our U.S industrial revenues were down slightly. That's driven primarily by weak automotive sector assembly and MAC, both down and we'll talk about those in the Q&A to the extent if there is interest. Our Engineered Solutions business was up 18%, 3% organically. Our Vidmar business remains very strong. Total storage grew 50%, 13% excluding acquisitions and in total segment profit was up 8% despite the lack of organic growth. The rate was flat we did well with pricing and productivity, and that offset any of the negatives associated with inflation and mix. Lot going on in the securities segment, profit up 17% on 3% revenue growth, and the rate up nearly 200 basis points. As previously stated, the 3% revenue growth for the total segment would have been in the neighborhood of 9% excluding hardware. Segment profit as I said remains strong up 17%. Looking at our sub-segments within security, convergent had a very, very good quarter. 12% sales growths, 2% of which was organic, the difference between those two are combination of a full quarter of HSM where we brought that business on in mid January a year ago, as well as foreign exchange of about 20% of that business is generated in the UK. So, that's the primary differences and of course some good pricing work between organic and total. Restoration of organic growth in the U.S. systems integration business was a very encouraging aspect of the quarter. As the HSM acquisition and the reverse integration that we have talked about on previous calls, that's taken an impact and it was good to see that we call the legacy convergent securities solutions business performing well, and showing some true organic growth. On the mechanical side revenue was down 3% as due overwhelmingly, or more than a 100% due to that hardware issue that I talked about before. Plus 7%, 4% of which was organic if we exclude hardware, and the profit increase, was driven by combination of organic growth price and the benefits of the HSM Integration and Convergent that we talked about previously. Good story, on working capital, which continues to contribute to, a good story on free cash flow. Specifically, looking at the elements, despite the softness in demand, we took five days out of inventory and reduced our inventory in absolute terms. Receivables were up five days are 11%. It's overwhelmingly due to European mix with a higher percentage of our revenue in Europe, foreign exchange, and as many of you are aware in general negotiated terms are a lot longer in Europe than they are in the U.S. So, the mix toward more European business in the first quarter this year versus last year is having an impact on receivables. Payables again, a nice improvement in payables, but I wanted just emphasize, I feel it, necessary to emphasize that it's simply, it is due to negotiation of terms with various suppliers, which is an advantage of our strong balance sheet and not withholding payments. We are upper grade investment level credit. We want to stay that way. And, it's simply due to better terms with some of our strategic suppliers and renegotiation of those terms. And, as a consequence, turns improved from 4.4 to 4.6, as inventory and payable performance, more than offset the increase in receivables. Cash flow was up $15 million in absolute terms, and as previously stated up 22%. Fairly straightforward, in terms of where it came from. The biggest contributor was just better management of working capital. We believe we're still on track to achieve our $500 million of free cash flow for the year. And, that of course is what's going to allow us to continue to pay the dividend, make acquisitions, and pursue our opportunistic buybacks as necessary and as required. Of course, it also results on our balance sheet staying pretty strong, and as I said the capacity to allocate our capital is consistent with previously strategies and priorities. Last but certainly not least is guidance. You look at 2007 EPS of $4 a share which was up 15% versus '06 and $457 million of cash flow, current guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 and $500 million in cash flow. This was outlined, we think as clearly as we can outline it with what we know today in the press release. But our first quarter EPS was consistent with the fiscal year of 2008 guidance of $4.20 to $4.40. Second quarter recessionary operating environment also was what we anticipated at the beginning of the year and the end of last year, when we issued our guidance. Our guidance assumed two quarters of organic revenue contraction, and that was consistent with our stated belief in a mild to short live U. S. recession. As a consequence, the second half economic conditions will need to stabilize in order to support the achievement of our full year guidance of $4.20 to $4.40. In the event that it doesn't, contingency plans are primarily in the form of cost and discretionary spending reductions. Secondarily in the form of pricing are being developed or in fact are in place to protect earnings above prior year levels, if in fact the weak demand continues. And based on what we have seen today and the good achievement, continued focus on working capital management, we believe that our $500 million estimate for free cash flow for the year is well within reach. At this point, I'd like to turn it back over to Sierra and Jim and I will try to respond to any questions you might have. Question and Answer
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.
Eric Bosshard: Thank you. Good morning.
John F. Lundgren: Good morning, Eric
James M. Loree: Eric.
Eric Bosshard: I guess a couple of things, one can you give us an update on where we are in the Bostitch improvement effort and even perhaps the portfolio evaluation, consideration with emphasis as well.
John F. Lundgren: Sure. I will take that one. I want to be sure you get your follow up and Eric Bostitch is I'd say on a long-term basis continuing to progress as we hope it would. It's fourth and first quarter, I'll say a bump in the road relative to the nice sequential improvement, we've seen for four quarters running before it. But there is so much confusion in the marketplace over, as I say 19% price increases across the board. What's that doing to volume on a short-term basis? It is really difficult to be very granular on how much of any volume softness was due to the confusion in the marketplace on price increases? How much of it was due to headwind? So it's fairly difficult to get up for us or anyone else on a short-term basis to get a handle on the Bostitch top-line. Strategically the manufacturing restructuring and our footprint modification is behind us and it's, we're quite pleased with the results. As I alluded to earlier, we've got a world class manufacturing facility in Langfang, China. We have great facility in the Southern Poland, as well as a very capable facility in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, and we've closed the facility that by no fault of its own. It was not up cost competitive in terms of delivery in Chihuahua, Mexico. We've actually moved nail production from China back to the U.S. As a result, about 10% of our production, the combination of labor rates, tariffs and Renminbi strength, has made it prudent for us to move about 10% of our production, and a 100 jobs with it back to the U.S on the fastening side. On the tool side, we're producing tools in the Besco plants in both Taiwan and China. That is on or slightly ahead of schedule, so we feel good there. So, I guess, to sum it up from the internal perspective, we're pleased with where we are to the extent that it faces marketplace challenges both in terms of the confusion around tariffs and North America headwind in term of construction, time will tell. You mentioned portfolio evaluation, we've been very clear about this for a long time. Our Bostitch is making money. I think sometimes people assume it isn't, but its low mid-single digits operating margin. It spent 10% or 12%. It needs to get back there, needs to get back there within a six to twelve month period, which is, will be two years after we started the restructuring program, or its less likely to be a part of the portfolio, and that we simply don't' continue to support businesses that are not creating shareholder value. Right now, it's not destroying shareholder value and they are doing. I think the team is doing an outstanding job with what they can control and we've got some pretty serious marketplace headwinds and we are trying to see if we can offset those going forward.
Eric Bosshard: And then just secondly, it seems like you've got a contingency that you've identified to ensure that you can have, I guess at least up earnings if demand continues to get worse, and I guess my question is, what is that consist of, and why not juts do it rather than wait to see what happens with the market?
John F. Lundgren: We've done some Eric. I'm going to let Jim give you as much insight on that as we are comfortable doing on this call, but if I inferred we are waiting, I may miss spoke or didn't communicate clearly enough. Two (Inaudible) and Jim will take you through a little bit of that.
James M. Loree: Well, I mean anytime you have a contingency plan that's going to generate enough earnings to be significant, it's going to involve reductions in force and obviously we take those very seriously, and we only do those when we feel it's appropriate to do. I mean, there is tradeoff's between the long-term and the short term that you invariably must make when you do those, and so our preference would be to not do anything in terms of the contingency plan, but the economic realities are out there. As John said we've done some, we've done the non people related part of it today. So, that's already in progress, and the way we are kind of looking at it is, it will cost us, if we do what we are doing, it will cost us about $0.20 a share and restructuring it will probably provide a benefit of about $0.40 a share. So, for plus $0.20 a share, to offset the lower volume in the second half that we might have if the economy doesn't come around. We are just making a decision, as to whether we want to do that or not based on the long term, short term tradeoffs.
Eric Bosshard: And, the net saves Jim would $0.20 in the second half, is how the math looks like it would shakeout?
James M. Loree: Yeah, I mean that the volume that we assumed in the original guidance, if we were to continue to experience the kinds of issues that we are having, the volume would be about a $0.50 issue for us, and we've get a net of about $0.20, which would be about $0.30. Now that's assuming, where we have minus 3%, I am talking organic growth at this point. We incurred about minus 3% or experience of about minus 3% organic growth in the first quarter. Our outlook for the second quarter is fairly consistent with that, so as we look into the second half and we don't see any improvements, then we are looking at about a $0.50 issue vis-à-vis the original guidance.
Operator: And your next question comes from James Lucas with Janney Montgomery.
James Lucas: Alright, thanks and good morning guys.
James M. Loree: Hey Jim.
James Lucas: Two housekeeping and one strategic question. With regards to the hardware comp when does that anniversary, that's the first one.
James M. Loree: Okay let's tackle that and then we will go to your other question or questions. The hardware and total cost will cost us about $50 million, about 40 of which will be experienced this year. The first three quarters of the year are the time in which that will be recognized. So, we are talking about $12 million to $15 million a quarter depending on the quarter for the first three quarters.
James Lucas: Okay. And, with regards to the buyback, I don't know if I missed this number, if you gave it out or not. How much did you buyback in the first quarter and how much of that left under the current authorization?
James M. Loree: Well we bought back 2.2 million shares in January at $46 a share that came on the heels of a 3.6 million share buyback and I think it was about a 8 million share authorization and we have expanded 2.2 million of it.
James Lucas: Okay, so there was nothing done after January.
James M. Loree: No.
James Lucas: Okay. And finally, with regards to Europe, could you give us a comment of what you are seeing there both from Facom, and your other industrial businesses and the consumer businesses, with regards to both of those?
James M. Loree: Yeah I mean, we were listening to Black & Deckers call, and I think that they mentioned that they were having a little bit of slowdown in Europe in the construction in DIY markets. And, I would say that our experience is reasonably consistent with that. It's a bit of slowdown, but it's not any kind of a deep dive like we are seeing in the U.S CDIY markets. Industrial, we are still growing in Facom organically, not the same kind of torrid rate that we were growing in the last half of last year. But still growing, so I think that what we have in Europe is the situation where the overall U.S. economy impact and the currency strength and everything else is providing a little bit of throttle on their growth, but it's not [tanking] in any respect.
James Lucas: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning.
James M. Loree: Morning.
John F. Lundgren: Hey Mike.
Michael Rehaut: First question, I guess this goes to the raw material impact. You had mentioned last quarter, that you were expecting about a $75 million from inflation and recovering about 80% of that. Can you give us an update on how those numbers worked now? And also, what that recovery or incremental positive might be with some of those incremental cost reduction efforts in place? I guess its more headcount related but nonetheless?
James M. Loree: I already talked about the cost reduction efforts in terms of the impact, which I will just repeat for ease of the administration here. It looks like it would be about a $0.40 improvement in the second half, which would be annualized around $0.80. And, the restructuring associated with that would be about $0.20, of which it's likely that $0.10 or so would be incurred in the second quarter, if we decide to do this. So, the net benefit of the restructuring would be, or the cost actions would be about $0.20, and it would be in the second half.
Michael Rehaut: I mean, and then $0.40 incremental in '09?
James M. Loree: If that has to forward to carryover absolutely, yeah.
Michael Rehaut: Because of the annualization?
James M. Loree: Correct.
John F. Lundgren: Correct.
Michael Rehaut: Okay.
James M. Loree: And, then your other question Mike was relative to the price inflation?
Michael Rehaut: Yeah.
James M. Loree: Yeah, I'm very pleased actually with our situation here, not the fact that we're getting more inflation, but the fact that we've responded I think very well. And, as soon as the next wave of inflation came in the first quarter, our operating heads jumped on it and implemented price increases. And, so we actually have good news to report here. Now the inflation estimate for the year is up to $100 million, so it's up $25 million, but the recovery percent is up to 90%.
Michael Rehaut: That's great. I mean that's really great reaction and proactivity. The second question is just on the commercial, your expectations for commercial end markets, obviously, on the consumer and macro side things are slowing but up until now commercial end markets have been relatively stable. It's not growing year-over-year, but the back half there are a lot of people out there looking for a significant slowdown. So, I was just wondering, if you could provide any idea of how your guidance either the $4.20 to $4.40 range or the more paired back type of expectations you are trying to set if things soften on a macro level, but within that what is your outlook for commercial and maybe just kind of remind us on a segment basis where that impacts your business?
James M. Loree: Well, it's about 10% of the company, and actually it's less than 10%, about 8% of the company, about $400 million in revenue. And it is largely in the Security segment. So, I mean, obliviously there are some in the Construction & DIY, but very little and most of it is in the Security segment. The guidance that we issued and we discussed this in a little bit of depth at the analyst meeting, is that we didn't really have anything specific on commercial, but we said that it would be slowing. We expected it to slow in the second half of the year, because of the credit issues that are being experienced at the moment. And, that we didn't expect it to go severely negative. So, I would suggest in this kind of contingency view if you will that we're thinking about here for the back half of the year, I would expect that we would anticipate issues in the commercial construction market beyond what we had in the original guidance.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks, Jim. One last question if I could. The free cash flow obviously comes in. It's still coming in nicely and you still have good confidence there. Relative to--
John F. Lundgren: Sorry Mike, go ahead.
James M. Loree: Have we loose him?
John F. Lundgren: Yeah, we lost him.
James M. Loree: Let's have the operator put him back on if we can.
John F. Lundgren: Why don't we take another call and answer.
James M. Loree: Yeah let's take another call, and while we're doing that, may be we can get him lined up to be, to finish his questions, thank you.
Operator: Mike, your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks, I appreciate that guy's. Just relating to the cash flow, projections and your use of that cash, if you could give us an idea, particularly on the acquisition front, how you see that market right now? If there are any more pressing or compelling opportunities relative to six or twelve months ago either in terms of price or in segment or geography?
John F. Lundgren: Yeah, I'll take Mike. The good news is the cash flow gives us the opportunity to continue to pursue our strategy and after we pay our dividend, I think, we've been very clear. Our strategic accretive acquisitions to clear our financial hurdles are our top priority, and that being said, Stanley is on sale right now, and we obviously look at it very carefully relative to acquisitions, even though they will advance our strategy. Our pipeline has never been more full to be specific in terms of your question. There's a lot there, particularly in Europe, both in the security space as well as in the industrial tools space, which are the growth platform where we focused. It won't surprise you or anyone to know that the fewer financial sponsors show up in auction or processes, or even an attempted unilateral negotiations. That being said, there has been little or no price capitulation thus far. So, long way of saying both in the tools space and in the security space, good properties are selling for multiples of recurring monthly revenues, multiples of EBITDA etcetera, that haven't come down at all relative to the last six to nine months. The difference being, the suitors tend to be overwhelmingly strategic, which of course wouldn't surprise you, and fewer and fewer financial sponsors just given the current credit environment. But the pipeline is full, as we go forward to make an acquisition our intend is to continue to built our capital base and bring in acquisitions at above our cost to capital, which we believe in the long-term create shareholder value. That being said, we had a Board meeting yesterday. We discussed each and every acquisition with our Board and before we make it, to the extent it's our cash, and it's our desire to maintain upper tier investment grade. We look at each and every acquisition strategically and financially relative to buying Stanley stock, and in this environment the share repurchase probably gets a closer look than it would have historically, but we have not changed our priorities and we've not changed our strategy.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird.
Peter Lisnic: Good morning, gentlemen.
James M. Loree: Hi, Pete.
Peter Lisnic: Jim, if I could, just to clarify on the back half of the year guidance, down 3% organically in the first quarter, it sounds like second quarter accounts the same number. Is the second half of the year just kind of run along at that, minus 3% or are you expecting improvement? I just want to make sure I understand it.
James M. Loree: Well, our guidance is 420 to 440 a share, and that as John mentioned when he went through his presentation is predicated on, was predicated on a short or a short lived, in mild recession in the U.S, and without a major global recession. So, the issue that we are facing right now is that, it's not even an issue, we are exactly where we though we would be when we issued the guidance, which is the first quarter would be really tough and the second quarter would be tough. And then, in theory if our assumptions hold true the third and the fourth quarters should get better. There is also its stimulus going on as you know with respect to interest rate reductions, with respect to fiscal stimulus as well, putting cheques in people hands in the U.S. and there are a number of reasons to think that it's possible that it could be better in the second half. But, I don't think anyone is going to bet on that certainly not us. But we are consistent with where we thought we would be. The wild card in the whole economic outlook for us has been the shakiness of the overall financial system over the past few months has really created more concerns on the part of the most folks here than we had before. And so, now we have seen some abatement in the last few weeks of that in particular with the Bear Sterns rescue and so forth. So, if the financial system stabilizes the stimulus works, I think there is a good possibility that we could have an okay second half, which would put us right smack in the range of our consensus. But, we want to give you a sense and I think, I saw a report from one of the analyst on the call who sort of pegged it as - we are sort of trying to quantify what we believe the downside to be for you if that doesn't occur. And, the downside is that we can still generate earnings growth while a number of our building products competitors are earnings are tanking 20% to 30% versus the prior year. And, that's a direct result of the portfolio shift, and also what we consider it to be a fairly direct response to the economic environment in terms of cost reductions and price inflation recovery.
Peter Lisnic: Okay that's very helpful thank you for that one and then my follow up question I guess. If I look at the CDIY segment and if I understood John correctly, it sounds like there is a, was there a $20 million raw material hit in the first quarter or was there a price offset?
John F. Lundgren: Yeah let me, Pete I mentioned that $20 million, when I was talking about CDIY. And, the majority of it is in the CDIY, because it's steel and that's Bostitch and that's hand tools. So, the majority of it is there. That 19, 20 million was on top of the 75 to 80 to get to the 100 that Jim reference previously. So, we entered the year saying 75 to 80. We observed another 20 in February. Get us to 100, or 20 to 25, get us to a 100 for the year. And those are the price offsets we worked hard to get in the place. In other words, we would look at 80% recovery when the number was 75%. We are now looking at 90% recovery, of a 100. We are still looking at $10 million of negative price inflation, which of course we are going to get some productivity, that's all on the annualized basis.
James M. Loree: Yeah. But in any way, we expect to have gross margin accretion, because though, as I mentioned in last call, we expect about $70 million of variable cost productivity, which should fall through and except for the un-recovered piece of the inflation, which is at this point about $10 million
John F. Lundgren: And, that was indicative. First quarter you saw 60 basis points of margin accretion despite all the activity that was going on out there, and despite soft volume relative to our plan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Robert Wertheimer with Morgan Stanley.
Robert Wertheimer: Good morning, everybody. You said something in the actual opening commentary that keeps my interest. You talked about renegotiating supplier terms, and I wonder whether that's because your suppliers are really starting to feel the credit crunch, and whether there is any risk there?
James M. Loree: No it's more a function of in particular the Asian suppliers. So for two or three years, we have been able to stave off the price increases, while they have experienced significant raw material price increases. We sort of expected that. Sooner or later, it would come to this, and a lot of them have basically decided that they can no longer ship under the previous prices. And, so they come to us and say, well we don't want to do business with you anymore because, you won't accept the price increase, you haven't accepted the price increase for two or three years and our prices have gone up X percent on steel and other input costs. So, when we, we would be grudgingly grant those, and we have a process to fully analyzed their cost structure and everything else and then work with them to do value engineering, to reduce the impact of the price increases to us and so on. But ultimately, we've ended up taking some price increases from some of these Asian suppliers. And, in almost every instance when that's happened, we've said to them, we're not taking any price increase unless you extend the terms 30 to 60 days from what they are. And, that's basically most of what the payable increases resulting from, as well as some currency, John didn't mention the currency when he was talking, but the currency had an impact as well.
Robert Wertheimer: Okay, fair enough. And then I would, just mechanically on your price increases, the one you just took, is that typically timing for the year, and if you talk about how often you typically do pricing in the year?
John F. Lundgren: I have to talk to you by segment.
Robert Wertheimer: Yeah.
John F. Lundgren: Let's take the easy ones first, easy to explain, not easy to get price increases. But insecurity and in our industrial business because, most of it is be-to-be most of our customers are in the very similar situation as we are. It tends to be far more transparent and their willingness to accept and pass on a price increase is understood because, they are in the same situation as we are. So, it tends to be relatively quick, 30 to 45 days notice and it passes through and they have the same capability to pass it on through. That 90% price recovery that Jim talked about, that's on a corporate wide basis. The numbers higher than 90 in security and industrial, and below that in CDIY and the reason there, I think it's pretty obvious and straightforward. A very large percentage of the CDIY business is sold through the North American and European home centers. Large retailer with lot of leverage and just as we have formal processes to fully {vat] and then, and in an essence resist pricing increases until we are sure there are merited. They have the same leverage and they have it from a $40 billion to $80 billion revenue base, and it takes a lot of work, a lot of working with the supplier, and a lot of negotiation on what else can change. So, they can keep their cost and ultimately their retail prices as low as possible. So, it takes three to six months in some case to truly realize the benefits of a price increase. And part of CDIY channel its more 30 to 60 days in some of the other channels. That's not unique to Stanley. It's just reflects the difference in the channel and how the pricing models work.
Robert Wertheimer: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.
Jeff: Yeah, this is Jeff calling in for Sam.
John F. Lundgren: Okay.
Jeff: First question is, we were pretty encouraged by the U.S. System Integration business. I was hoping you could talk about that a little bit, and whether or not you were surprised at all, or how did that came in, kind of just when you are planning forward?
John F. Lundgren: We too were encouraged. We were surprised. Jim is right in the middle of it, so I am going to ask him to take that.
James M. Loree: Yeah, I mean, the encouraging thing about it is that it's happening a little faster than we expected. If you look at what we've said in the past, we were expecting to go through about the first half of this year with continued negative organic growth in that particular part of the business. And, as it turned out, we were able to emerge two quarters earlier with organic growth. And, the reason that is, is that we had a fair amount of sales turnover last year that was anticipated, but the folks that have stayed and the new folks clearly have brought into the business model, which involves recurring revenue as well as installation revenue as part of the sales process they brought into the compensation plans that we have and we're finding that gaining share is feasible. In particular, at the national accounts, it's been, we've been a welcome alternative to the other supplier out there or suppliers. And, in general, convergence security is really picking up momentum, and we feel very good about it.
Jeff: Okay. My follow up is in regards to, in your script you mentioned something about the automotive business weakness, and it sounded basically, that like, may be there is little more three than market weakness, I was, can you talk about that?
James M. Loree: Yeah, let's start by hopefully, it didn't sound like we're reading a script, because we don't do that. But I do understand, you met in the formal comments. Let me distinguish, between our small OEM business assembly, which is facing the same marketplace headwinds obviously that anybody supplying the North American or European automotive business would do. That business is soft from a top line perspective. That team has done a great job adjusting its cost base to stay inline with it, and in fact saw some margin accretion as a result of it. The issue there is volume. The rest of the business though what we do call, industrial and automotive repair, you think some of Proto, some of Facom, and certainly MAC, it's been difficult. If you think of the MAC model, the drivers are paying for their own gasoline, that's extraordinarily expensive, and a large part of the MAC top line comes from very high ticket items sold on consumer credit, which their end users are having difficulty, quite frankly coming up with the credit to buy it. So, a lot of that softness is driven by the combination of energy prices, and tight credit in the end user market for that particular segment, because the industrial part of that business is performing extraordinarily well. That the Proto, the part of Facom that goes to industrial in Europe. We are quite pleased with how they are performing. So, if it involves consumer credit, if it involves gasoline, it's going to be tough in the end market place. And, lastly, we don't talk too much about individual businesses, but we are making progress with, I'll say distributor recruiting model with Mac where historically we looked very, very hard and very closely on. How many distributors did we add, how many distributors did we lose in a particular quarter, with not enough focus on retention. The way that business model works is we need to keep these people for 12 to 18 months before they turn profitable. So, I won't bore you with the details but the MAC team has really stepped up the sophistication and the scrutiny under which they look at distributors before they add them. The end result is, we are going to add fewer distributors without question, because the border for them to clear clearing and become a distributor is much higher. The theory is that while we will be adding fewer distributors, our retention rate will be dramatically higher and in the long run that will be great for Stanley. We are only 1.5 quarters into this in new process, so I can't tell you, yet that it's working, but I know both at the MAC level, Donald McIlnaydone who is responsible for our industrials tools group is well of those of that that headquarters in the HR function as well as Senior Executive Management, looked at the program, take it to the right way to go, and we are consciously optimistic that that's going to help him. But right now, it's a difficult environment.
Jeff: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of (Inaudible) with Cardinal Capital [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. My main question was, when we talk about organic growth in the various segments for the rest of the world, is it possible to discuss them on a constant currency or a local currency basis, so we have a better idea for example, for Facom, rest of the world 6%, CDIY, what we are talking about on a local currency basis?
James M. Loree: We do that, specifically our organic growth numbers exclude any foreign currency translations. So, if the number is organic it has no currency in it, and it is what it is.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Montgomery.
James Lucas: My question was answered, thank you.
Operator: And, at this time there are no further questions.
John F. Lundgren: Okay, well let's than thank everybody for their attention. Busy day, a lot of earning releases up out, and we very much appreciate those of you who are able to join us live today. As always, Jerry and Greg actually are both available. If you have a specific follow up question that's either you didn't get answered or our comments have raised a question that you didn't get to ask we would be happy to hear from you. Thanks very much for your interest and participation this morning.
Operator: Thank you for participating in today's Stanley Works first quarter results conference call. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect

===== 2007 Q4  (2008-01-29 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Matthew and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Stanley Works Fourth Quarter earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Gerry Gould, VP of Investor Relations. I will turn the call over to him at this time. Thank you. Mr. Gould, you may begin your conference.
Gerry Gould: Okay. Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everybody. On the call this morning with me are John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; and Jim Loree, our Executive VP and CFO. We have two press releases out in that I refer to the 4Q update and initial ’08 guidance we issued on January 7, and then the fourth quarter results and ’08 guidance we issued this morning, both on our website. Also our PowerPoint presentation is on the website. We will refer to these charts as we go along. We have got PDF version out there about 20 minutes ago. John and Tim will review the results and then we will have a Q&A period following. The either call last about an hour. There will be replay available beginning at 1 PM today through the end of the day Saturday which is February 2. The replay number is 800-642-1687. You did need a code for the replay which is 30996508, and after it will remain on our site. You can call me with questions at 860-827-3833. And we just have two quick announcements, the first regarding Reg G. We issue an update our earnings guidance on an annual basis in our press release. At the beginning of the quarter, and we cannot comment upon and thereafter. If it changes materially, we would issue a press release and conduct a call. And secondly, certain statements contained in this discussion by the various Stanley participants are forward-looking statements. They are based on assumptions on future events that may not prove to be accurate; as such they involve risks and uncertainty. And actual results may differ materially from those expected or implied. So, we direct you to the cautionary statements in Form 8-K, which we filed with today's release and then our recent 34 Act filings. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Lundgren.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks, Gerry. Good morning everybody. What I am going to do is touch on some of the 2007 full year as well as fourth quarter highlights. Then turn it over to Jim Loree. Jim is going to go through some of our progress on cash flow, provide a little more detail, drill a littler deeper into the segments, and talk about some of our recent repurchase activity as well as 2008 guidance. The 2007, in general, and the fourth quarter, in particular, I think provides us some pretty good evidence on the merits of our ongoing portfolio diversification As you know that started arguably five years ago, certainly started to gain traction about four years ago, and it continues to reduce our volatility that enabled us to achieve sales earnings as well as cash flow growth due in part to a higher European and industrial and security content in the obvious lower dependence on the construction and DIY markets, which we have heard for the last six months are fairly weak in North America. Looking quickly, revenues $4.5 billion, up 12%, 26% increase in operating margin and Jim’s going to get into the drivers at that. 15% EPS growth, 25% growth in EBITDA, we are quite pleased with our cash flow, both from an operating cash flow perspective as well as free cash flow. All of these numbers on this page are in the release and in the appended financial statements. But to say the least we were far from disappointed, in fact we are quite pleased with these results in light of the market conditions, particularly North America where we compete throughout 2007. Looking at the fourth quarter financial results, good solid revenue growth and I am going to provide more details on it in the next slide. But revenue growth at 15%, earnings per share of a $1.04 in fourth quarter ’06 increasing to a $1.11, a 7% increase, 16% increase without the check… check win that I am going to touch on in a minute. Just as it relates to guidance we normally don’t spend a lot of time talking about how we performed versus guidance, but in October of ’07 we were out with a $1.10 to a $1.15. Given some of the… much of the uncertainty out in the market, we did provide updated guidance even though there was not a material change in our business which historically is not our custom, but we updated our guidance to a $1.06 to a $1.11 as Jerry suggested in early January. The $0.04 was simply reflection of $0.04 of settlements of some legal issues for which at the time we saw no offsets, and as you can see from the results we came in at the very top end of our revised guidance, or in fact right in the middle of our initial guidance. So, throughout the volatility, very little change really attesting to the strength at least in our view of where we are. Nice accretion in operating margin of 600 basis points in the quarter, the tax rate up to 21.3%, that was within our guidance range but that was about $0.09 worth of EPS headwind versus prior year. Our share count on average was about the same in the quarter, down 600,000 shares but as Jim will touch on later we did refer to just about a $100 million worth of stock in the fourth quarter, and another $100 million in the first quarter not included in this share count. So, earnings growth was consistent with our guidance that we provided in October, as well as updated in early January. Looking at a little more detail the fourth quarter revenues, again the 15% improvement, the sources of growth are pretty straight forward. Volume was 1% globally. Price was 1% for 2% organic growth and I’m going to talk a little bit more about that on the next slide. But in terms of the price that 1% gave us about 75% inflation recovery for the year. Where early on in the year in our calls, in our annual guidance which was $4 and that’s where we finished. We assumed about $60 million of commodities inflation. Our best estimate at the end of the year, we absorbed about $67 million, so it was a pretty accurate estimate. The difference between the $60 million and $67 million was the overwhelming majority of that difference was the elimination of value added tax rebate reductions from China… resulting increase. So, we had a pretty good handle on that at the beginning of the year, there were obviously some foots and calls but the good news is of the $67 million that we felt that we absorbed, pricing covered three quarters of it so more of our productivity could fall to the bottom line. And lead to our margin expansion. Currency added 5%, about 35% of our revenues are outside the U.S. the majority of that is in Europe and acquisitions added another 8%, the biggest single piece there was HSM. Looking real quickly at the segments you see construction, DIY flat on an organic basis, up 5% in total for the fourth quarter that’s primarily the inclusion of Besco Pneumatic, our strategic Taiwanese and Chinese tool manufacturer that we purchased mid year. Really strong performance in our industrial segments, both from an organic perspective, Jim’s going to provide more detail on that but both automotive repair, automotive and industrial tools as well as our engineered solutions businesses performed well, 15% in total the difference being primarily attributable to our InnerSpace acquisition. That’s industrial storage included from mid year on. Security, 1% organic in total as strong performance in the mechanical business offset some negative growth in the legacy of conversion security solutions business, and of course is that we are placing on the Stanley Fulfillment system which has taken place really over the last 12 months or so. We talked about it briefly on the March 8,analyst meeting. Second the winter inventory position that we have now comes at an excellent time given the uncertain economic outlook in the slowing world economy. Thirdly the improvements are based on process improvement and not some sort of a tactical or knee jerk reaction to bringing inventories down and they do not come at the expense of customer service levels which is very important. And then finally the extra cash that we generated from our fourth quarter working capital improvement totaled $86 million and that helped fund our ability to do another $100 million share re-purchase in the first few weeks of 2008. So moving on to the cash flow statement. As I discussed working capital clearly was one of the key catalysts in the fourth quarter, you can see the $86 million there. We were also aided by strong depreciation and amortization and strong net income. We had a total operating cash flow of $218 million and free cash flow of $186 million. On the right hand side for the total year, free cash flow was a record $457 million, the big story here in addition to working capital was depreciation and amortization and this is increasingly becoming a huge cash generator for us. All that intangible amortization that’s come from the four, five years of acquisitions now totals about $160 million a year that we add to the net income and then on top of that we had a good working capital improvement of $31 million given the sales growth that we experienced. And what you don’t see on the page here is about $60 million of cash out which would be in that other line related to severance and mostly from the Facom acquisition, a good portion of which is not likely to recur in ’08 and that should help our center prospective basis. All of that yielded a record free cash flow which exceeded our forecast of $400 million to $450 million which we introduced on March 8th back in New York and the $457 million gives us a good, solid platform to go into ’08 with. When you look at cash flow form a longer term perspective clearly the ’07 performance caps a string of really strong cash flow performances over the last ten years or so. And this performance has really been a result of the portfolio transformation that John talked about in recent years and interestingly of the transformation itself has both been an enabler of ongoing growth as well as a kind of a manifestation of that portfolio shift and so it’s a virtuous circle so to speak and as we look at ’08 our expectation is for $500 million plus of free cash flow and a continuation of this strong performance. And as I said it should be doable because we have a good, strong net income and lower restructuring and then the benefits of Stanley Fulfillment System should continue to appear in the cash flow statement. So, very, very strong position going into ’08 from a cash perspective. Just a brief comment or two on the portfolio shift, we have covered this before, but we have been able to achieve 16% average annual growth since ’02 growing the revenues from $2.6 billion to $4.5 billion. And the company is no longer dominated by the construction and DIY market. In fact the US portion is about 25% versus 50% just 5 years ago. And as John indicated this certainly is fortuitous for us in this weak United States construction DIY market environment. And what we have here is a company that also, their largest, our largest customer is only 8% of revenues today versus 22% a few years ago and our dependence on the US home centers and mass merchants is greatly reduced down to below 20% from about 40% in 2002. We have a larger, more depressed company and a stronger company to stand up to some of the pressures that we are encountering from an external perspective. And now we will go through the segments in a little more detail as John indicated. The construction in DIY segment had an okay performance from a revenue perspective and a good one when you consider the degree of difficulty in the environment. Segment profit was down 8% and our segment profit rate was down 190 basis points. Now, notably $3 million of the $5 million segment profit decline is associated with the legal matters that John discussed in the quarter. So that would be kind of a one off if you will. But clearly the US was adversely impacted by the residential construction market issues. In fact, the US construction DIY was down about 4% but the rest of the world was a great story. The sales were up 19%, continued to be strong in the wake of the strong third quarter performance and here we had some benefits from an ongoing wave of new product introductions in Europe, Canada, Australia, Latin America and Asia and outstanding execution in those areas and a little help from decent economic environments from most of those places. The segment profit rate as I mentioned in addition to the $3 million decline related to legal matters was also somewhat suppressed by unfavorable product mix within the consumer tools and storage business and therein we had a mix towards consumer storage both plastic and metal storage and you can imagine plastic and metal storage, the plastic being affected by the rise in prices related to oil and the metal being affected by the strong Canadian currency as we ship those products from Canada into the US. And there was also a currency benefit significant in this segment however, these… the constructions DIY business also had a significant inventory reduction. So, this is true for the total company but it is also true for the construction DIY segment, the benefits of the currency in the quarter were significant and the total for the company was $7 million and it was a couple of million for the CDIY segment, but the inventory is coming down from a P&L perspective basically offset that so, there’s really no significant impact from currency when you factor in the inventory reductions. Moving on to industrial, here we have a terrific story, revenues up 15% as John indicated, the segment profit up double that 31% with almost 200 basis point increase in the segment profit rate. When you break it down into the sub-segments if you will, the industrial and automotive repair tools part of it, which is your Facom Mac Proto piece, that was up 11% of which 5% was organic. Proto had a terrific quarter up 17% revenues without any acquisitions, there was some share gain, there was some customers buying ahead of price increases, price increase effective in January of 3% and there was also some good market strength as in particular the petrochemical demand continues playing into one of our strengths in Proto. And Facom although it was a little bit less in terms of organic growth than they encountered in the third quarter still had a strong organic performance netting out currency, they were up 2%. Engineered Solutions, terrific quarter, up 15% organic and up almost 30% with the acquisition of InnerSpace, we encountered double-digit growth in all three of the elements Industrial Storage, Assembly and Hydraulics. Each driven by good gains in product innovation as well as decent end markets. And then the segment profit range within Industrial increased as well and here we saw the result of what I would consider excellent execution in the area of price realization and productivity with price offsetting inflation and then productivity basically following through and in Stanley we have a very robust process for tracking inflation and making sure that the price increases are implemented on or about at the same pace and the idea here is to try to offset the inflation with pricing cuts, stay ahead of the curve as much as possible and we have very good market intelligence from our sourcing organizations about when those inflationary costs are coming through, how much they are and there would be sourcing people on the… Operations people work hand in hand with the marketing folks to make sure that they’re armed with the data to go to their customers in real time and implement price increases. It’s easier in industrial than it is in construction in DIY. That’s why our price inflation recovery is about 100%, slightly above industrial in the fourth quarter. Whereas it was much, much lower in construction DIY, say less than 50%. But still we have that process throughout the company and you can see the benefits clearly in industrial. Security also had a fantastic quarter, with revenues up 30 % on the strength of the HSM acquisition. Segment profit was up 44% and our profit rate was again up almost 200 basis points. Mechanical access really strong, 8% revenue growth despite the Home Depot hardware loss. Of that 8%, 4% was organic; the other 4% was smaller acquisitions. The hardware loss in Home Depot cost us $10 million of revenue in the quarter. As John said, if we had benefited from it, from a delay in the loss of that business during the previous quarters. It really hit us in the fourth quarter. We expected it. That was the good news. But it had a five-point impact on organic growth in mechanical and a couple of points on the total segment. Convergent, HSM performed very well. HSM had 11% organic growth performance; if you consider it, consider that on a pro forma basis as if we owned HSM in the fourth quarter of last year, even though we didn’t. So, they executed well. We continue to have the negative pressure from our business model change that is taking place in the U.S. systems integration business. But this is a very good thing because we're shedding unprofitable business and it cost us 50% negative organic growth in the legacy USSI business in the quarter. However, we have basically one or two more quarters to go anniversary out of that and the business we're taking on today is very profitable business. Much more similar to HSM’s business, with a nice recurring revenue content as well. The segment profit increase was also driven by price realization as well as the realization of the HSM synergies and good strong productivity projects within the mechanical access business. So, all of that goodness allowed us to because a little bit more active in terms of repurchasing shares. As you know in November and December of ’07 we repurchased 2 million. In May of ’07 we repurchased 1.7 million and with the depressed price levels in the early days of January of this year we repurchased another 2.2 million. So, in the last 12 months or so we've spent now $300 million on share repurchases at an average price of $51.70. With this most recent repurchase, the shares outstanding have dipped slightly below $80 million fully diluted shares. Our total debt at the end of the year was about $1.5 billion. If we take the $100 million that we spent on the share repurchases, probably now closer to $1.6 billion as we said here today. And at $47 a share or so, the company is trading for an enterprise value of about $5.3 billion with ‘07 EBITDA of about $694 million, that would be about 7.6 times trailing EBITDA. So, when you look at the value inherent that we see in the stock, hence the attractiveness or buying back shares at this time. And as we move now to 2008 guidance this is nothing new here, this is all reaffirmation of what we introduced in the early days of January, when we pre announced our fourth quarter as well as updated our ’08 guidance and as most folks on the call know, we are no longer providing quarterly guidance, we announced that over a year ago. And so this is the annual guidance for 2008 and the organic growth has been tempered to flat up 1% we are anticipating a very mild and short lived recession by definition and that would be in the US by definition, that would mean two quarters of negative GDP growth in the US. However, we do not expect it to go beyond that level of recession because the monetary and apparently the fiscal stimulus will be fairly strong coming into this year. So, hopefully this will be short lived and so that 0% to 1% growth would be consistent with how we performed in past recessions we’ve done some work looking at it, typically will be a flattish to maybe up or down a point during a recession and we might have two quarters of negative a couple quarters of negative growth during the year where that, organic growth, where that occurred. As far as other assumptions related to sales growth we’re looking for to do some acquisitions. We haven’t built anything in to the guidance obviously we’re looking for a share count of about 82 million shares which anticipates a nominal share creep and no new repurchase although we are not ruling repurchases out at this point in time. We have our free cash flow expectation of around $500 million. We have about $100 million-ish kind of a dividend and there’s $400 million to work with to keep within our ratings. Roughly to keep within our ratings profile we spent $100 million of it so there’s $300 million left to spend and we’ll be looking at acquisitions, we’ll be looking at share repurchases and we’ll make whatever informed judgments that we deem appropriate at the time. As far as inflation goes, we had a very consistent track record in ’07 of predicting inflation, we certainly anticipate that to continue into ’08. We're looking for about $75 million of inflation including currency EVRR [ph] all those sorts of things. We’ll get about 80% of that back and recovered in price we believe it this time. Similar to our ’07 performance we expect to generate another $70 million or so in productivity. Our SG&A would probably be a slightly increase in dollars versus ’07 and a slightly, very slightly increase perhaps in percent of sales, if that sales forecast comes to fruition as it will increase slightly faster than in all likely hood than the sales growth with it’s tempered sales outlook. And I mentioned free cash flow already and the tax rate we’re looking for a similar tax rate in ’08 that we experienced in ’07 and I think we are very well positioned for some. Earnings growth despite a very challenging market environment. With that I will turn it back over to Q&A. Matthew we are ready to take questions. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird.
John F. Lundgren: Pete?
Peter Lisnic: Can you hear me?
John F. Lundgren: Yes Pete we hear you now.
Peter Lisnic: Ok sorry. Jim I was intrigued I guess by your comments on Facom with the growth slowing, looks like you have kind of a mid to high single-digit for the past couple of quarters and then down to two. Can you give us a sense as to what your expectations for the European economy might look like for ’08. The slowing growth of Facom is something that we ought to be incrementally concerned about or just kind of what’s your thought there?
James M. Loree: I think the Facom growth was not a… earlier in the year was not a direct result of any economic boom over in Europe. Clearly there was one point higher of GDP growth than we typically had been experiencing in Europe over the last X number of years and Facom and GDP would be expected to track fairly closely. So, I think, the growth was more a function of the Facom folks joining a company that was willing to fund new product introductions and was a real tool company and there was some revenue synergies that we talked about that we didn’t anticipate in our financial forecast for Facom when we bought the company. And all those things were positive but the comps are getting tougher and yes I think the likelihood of the economy maintaining that slightly higher than historical GDP growth in the context of a US slowdown is not very high. And so we have tempered our growth outlook on a prospective basis for Facom. We are looking at probably something closer to flat to up a point or so for Facom as we go forward.
Peter Lisnic: Okay great. Thanks on that one and then the follow-up question I guess. The working capital obviously was quite strong in the fourth quarter. I’m just wondering how sustainable is this working capital improvement through the fulfillment system and another way of asking the question might be you have a longer term target or there is something there that would encourage us to say, this is sustainable, this is where Stanley is going in terms of working cap?
John F. Lundgren: Yes Pete, I am going to start and Jim will take it. We’d like to think it’s sustainable and we are not going to put a specific longer term target up there other than to say, the Stanley Fulfillment System is all about continuous improvement. We’ve been working, I don’t want to say quietly behind the scenes but working very hard, focusing each and every one of our business unit leaders on, among other things working capital efficiency and working capital improvement and as you are probably aware a meaningful piece of every P&L owner’s compensation is based on measurable improvement in working capital turns on an annual basis. At the corporate level we are measuring on cash flow and the business unit level it is on working capital turns. So, simply said it will be continuous improvement. We have been working on it a while, I think the fourth quarter we really began to gain some traction and saw the first tangible results of that. Jim you might want to add something.
James M. Loree: Yes. I think that’s… its very consistent with what I would say as well. The only thing I would add is that inventories were the star of the show in the fourth quarter and will continue to put upward pressure on the working capital turns through our process improvements in from a Stanley Fulfillment System. What we would like to see in ’08 and beyond is a continuation of the inventory improvements… continuation of the payables improvements which have been now in place for about two years and then the beginning of some improvements in receivables as well and that would be something that we are working on very diligently and I believe that there is some opportunity there, receivables are $800 million, North of $800 million and clearly there is some process improvement opportunities there. Perhaps not as much as in inventories because they are dictated by terms and terms have to be negotiated in their economic tradeoffs that one makes but there is a lot of waste in receivables in any company that doesn’t have fully standardized processes and a process focus and Stanley’s history with all of acquisitions and everything and it certainly left some opportunities on the table so I think we will se a broader based working capital improvement as we go through ‘08 but we certainly won’t let up on inventories or payables.
Peter Lisnic: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Radbourne Atlantic Equities.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello.
John F. Lundgren: Hi Richard.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. This is actually Joe Herick with Gutermine[ph] Research. A couple of questions. You guys talked about continuous improvements a while ago
John F. Lundgren: What firm?
Unidentified Analyst: Hello.
John F. Lundgren: What firm are you with?
Unidentified Analyst: Joe Herick with Gutermine [ph] Research. You guys talked earlier about continuous improvement initiatives. Regarding your operational initiative what are you guys doing regarding lean manufacturing, TPN to Six Sigma and how do you expect them to affect the bottom line?
John F. Lundgren: The end your question was how to what about the bottom line?
Unidentified Analyst: How are you expecting looking at Lean manufacturing, Six Sigma within your operational plans and how do you expect them to--?
John F. Lundgren: Listen, we’ve reviewed that at great length on previous calls. Lean, Six Sigma et cetera are tools, they are not processes within themselves that are going to contribute to improved working capital efficiency as well as margin accretion and we will take that offline to the extent we need to but we have got 19 people in the queue and don’t want to spend any more time on that on this particular call.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with Merrill Lynch.
John F. Lundgren: Hi Ken. Good morning.
Kenneth Zener: If you can update us on the status of Bostitch given that it’s such a large business and I know the margins, You guys had expected them to go up roughly100 basis points sequentially in ’07 and into ’08. Can you tell us where we were or refresh us at the beginning of ’06, end of ’07 and what your expectations are?
John F. Lundgren: Yes. Basically I can’t, as we have said on several occasions. Bostitch was in terms of margin and performance, the business was shrinking due to a combination of market and us consciously shedding unprofitable business, up to 5% even arguably approaching 10% of revenues although some of that will get back. They will load mid single digit operating margins at the end… by the end of ‘06. What we said we would like to do is March from about four to 12 in the course of eight quarters, on average 100 basis points a quarter, I mean the state quarter spends a 100 basis points getting us to 12. What we also said is that we wouldn’t be perfectly linear. We can’t say by the end of the year without providing more detail than we intend to for all of ’07. They made a nice sequential improvement. Fourth quarter was a bit of a setback. That been said there were three things…two things going on that are really difficult to isolate. As you know we had a about$ 4 million… $3.7 million charge that hit above our P&L. That’s easy to isolate, unfavorable product liability litigation but it did show up in the Bostitch numbers. We had the preliminary implications of the anti-dumping legislation that in some cases increased costs, but the flip side of that gave the opportunity to improve prices. No telling where that will settle out in the short-term. But it was too upsetting factors for Bostitch. And then third. The business is 75% North American… in North American at least half of that residential construction related and that’s a tough business. So they got a lot of market headwind. Long answer to a simple question. We're happy with where we are in manufacturing restructuring. We have our Besco pneumatic that we purchased. We've very successfully closed our Chihuahua plant. Ramping up in Langfang we have world-class production on three continents. North America, Poland and China and we're still cautiously optimistic about the future of that business. But there are tremendous marketplace uncertainties that are tempering our optimism.
James M. Loree: Yes. And I remind you there’s one additional clarification on the guidance I wanted to make relative to the anti-dumping decision that was made by the department of commerce. And that is that the inflation and the price information that I actually gave you, excludes the anti-dumping impact because it’s been, it has been happening in real time, happened last week, late last week, in terms of the decision and we haven’t had an opportunity to fully wet it although we believe that it’s going to be essentially a neutral to a slightly positive, very slightly positive for us for the year from a financial perspective. So, we're not excluding it because it’s a negative or anything like that. We're simply excluding it because we don’t have accurate numbers for the price inflation impact related to it and you can imagine it at a 30, 29 point something, 29.6% I think it is percent. Tariff and many of our nails that we import from China as well as all the other nails that are imported from China ranging anywhere from, in the low teens of percentage up to 110% and so our competitors are going to experience, in many cases the same type of impact if not worse and from a strategic perspective it really, I think, is a positive for us. A very big positive for the Bostitch business because it’s… this business has really had to compete in a very, very unfair environment over the last couple of years as the Chinese startups have been dumping these nails into our country and certainly the punitive tariffs that were put in place, especially the ones that are North of 30% are really going to change and they are going to level the playing field, we hope and on top of that we have the most diverse manufacturing base of nail manufacturing of all our competitors. With manufacturing in Eastern Europe, North America and China and we have the flexibility to move production around from place to place as the economics of producing the… cost economics of producing change so we actually hail the advent of this anti dumping issue. I think it is going to be kind of a real positive for the business on a go forward basis.
James M. Loree: Give a follow up Kim?
Stephen Kim: I do I appreciate the expansion of that as well Jim. The consumer margins, just to focus on this, I think that’s where a lot of people do have this concern though, obviously your other 60 plus % of businesses are operating very well. The consumer business, you talked about the 190 basis points margin drop earlier related to U.S. mix and absence of price recovery. Can you talk about the mix A and B, why we see better pricing outside the US relative to the U.S.? Thank you very much.
James M. Loree: Well, first of all we need to make sure that everyone the $68 million going to $63 million is a $5 million decrease in profit rate, of which 60% of which, is related to non recurring items. The legal matters, and I don’t know if that was entirely clear when I said it but make sure that we understand that. And so if we added the three back to the $63 million we’d be at $66 million divided by 459, am just doing math in real time here, We would be at 14.3 instead of 13.7 so we’d be a 130 basis points decline so that’s a piece of it. The mix issue itself, in the quarter it’s simply one of… we were doing some refreshing of some product lines in both ZAG and our consumer storage business, and it just so happens those are our lowest margin businesses in construction DIY, and unfortunately you know that’s just what happened. That would be a big piece of the remainder of the negative there, and we don’t see an inherent profitability issue in this segment, on a go forward basis especially with Bostitch recovering and with construction in DIY being so strong outside the country. Now there is pricing power outside the U.S. is actually a bit higher than it is in the U.S. although not dramatically higher and that results from the fact that we are planning in many fragmented markets… much more fragmented markets from a customer prospective outside of the U.S. whether it’s in Latin America, or Europe or Australia, whatever. That said there’s some very large customers that wield a very significant amount of power. There’s been a lot of talk about China inflation and so forth as well in our business and other businesses that were affected by China inflation and there’s a lot of people getting exercised about inflation from China and how that might negatively impact these types of businesses, in particular these segments and in fact we look and again it’s China inflation is more of a positive than a negative for us because the single largest competitive for Stanley Works is not another branded tool company, it’s private label in the aggregate. Private label in the aggregate buys 80% to a 100% of their product from China, and with prices going up the retailers are facing pricing… unprecedented price increases and pressure from China and that just simply is a positive for us, because on a comparable basis it means that we are more competitive with our non-China manufacturing and that we are on a level playing field from a China perspective.
Stephen Kim: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney.
James Lucas: Two questions on the acquisition integration side please. First, could you bring us up to date, you talked a little bit about Facom’s end markets, but in terms of the overall European industrial strategy, both from a manufacturing standpoint as well as going to market of combining the Facom and Stanley brand? Can you just give us a quick update there and secondarily with regards to the convergence business… you had alluded to it in the opening remarks in terms of as the strategy there evolves but in terms of the older lower margin business that you have been purposely changing the portfolio from. How far long are we on that and just overall how do you feel about how that convergence strategy is coming together?
John F. Lundgren: Yeah Jim, it’s John. I will take them both and Jim will add on if need be. First of all, in Europe in the integration, I think there’s two important integrations going on if you will, backroom and front room, the strength our customer facing. From the backroom perspective, if it doesn’t face the customer and end user, we are trying to do within one place, one way, we are making… at they were making great progress there including a seamless transition in leadership on the Facom side of the business. But, importantly we have no intention to combine the Stanley and Facom brands other than in emerging markets where we don’t have the structure and the scale to have if you will, a dedicated sales force. So, in markets where we are spread a little thin, you do have one individual reporting jointly to the Facom and Stanley side, but in general and you know this well, Facom Is an iconic brand for professional automotive repair and industrial tools. Stanley brand in Europe is overwhelmingly construction and DIY, and we intend to keep them that way. So, we are quite pleased with the integration in terms of cost synergies, the organizations are working better, very well together, better than in fact we had hoped for and all we can say on that one is now we are 24 months into it, so far so good and the two businesses are working well together. The other point that Jim made on Facom is I think an important one up to the first caller to Pete Lisnic’s question. The improvement in Facom revenues is a combination of great new product vitality which has always been the case but less attrition or cannibalization from the existing business and I think that is the strength of the combination. Real quickly to touch on conversion and security, Jim suggested we probably have two more quarters before some of… I will say the bad legacy business, primarily installation driven at low margins is going to filter through the system. In terms of the two organizations, again we are as pleased as we could be at this point with how well they are working together. I think everyone understands on the Stanley side, it was a little bit difficult to say, wait a minute we have just bought… excuse me… we have just bought HSM. We are doing a reverse integration but the margins speak for themselves, the business processes speak for themselves, the percent of recurring revenue speaks for themselves and I think by now they are starting to… they really are starting to behave as one team. We have got the majority of the office consolidation behind us, leadership is aligned and we are… on both those fronts we are certainly not complacent but we are on or ahead of schedule in terms of the integration and looking for some margin improvement on the legacy Stanley side going forward.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.
Eric Bosshard: Two questions for you. First of all, the mechanical side you commented of the improved growth out of assets, it sounds like almost 10% excluding the hardware. What’s driving that and what’s the sustainability of that?
John F. Lundgren: Well, there’s a number of factors driving it. And I would say they are more related to execution and… than anything else. And the first is, and I guess I mentioned last quarter, there is a real intangible benefit to having split the mechanical and the electronic businesses. I think in reality they are quite different businesses and the issues that one has to deal with in transforming an electronic business model are very distracting to someone who is trying to go out there to do business, that is trying to go out and gain share in the electronic, I mean in the mechanical business. That said, I think over the last few years we have assembled a very broad based product line that covers virtually all of the important elements of a full fledged mechanical product line. Why is this important? Because in the past we were losing bids in mechanical and losing business occasionally, when competition had products in certain areas, an example of the exit devices in closers and so forth and another example which we have yet to plug but we hope to someday, that will be hollow metal doors where they would underbid one element and overbid another element of the proposal to win the business where we couldn’t compete in the areas where we didn’t have the business. That’s virtually behind us, we have one remaining hole now which is hollow metal doors, as I mentioned. Another benefit to the mechanical business has been the tremendous strength of the Access technologies business, the automatic door business and that particular business basically put together a value proposition to the customer which is predicated on national footprint with 24x7 service and a service contract type of mentality where it is a service based business and they pull through a lot of mechanical product. Justin’s actually been talking about this for years and gradually and methodically putting together that service value proposition and that certainly paying off in spades, so and then the final thing is we have added specifiers. We have added specifiers in the mechanical business deal best Access Legacy business, if you will and the combination of all those factors have contributed to good solid building momentum in that particular business. To understand those re-structural factors is the reasonable the thing that you can see sustained better growth like we saw in the fourth quarter.
John F. Lundgren: Well, I think the thing we have to be realistic about in mechanical is we are going to encounter some market headwinds and I don’t think they are going to be dramatic like they are in the residential side but take that small piece of security, it’s probably 30% of security roughly that is commercial construction related business. When you have a… I think we all expect to see some pull back in commercial construction, I don’t know how much, various people expect that in our case we expect to see some pullback but not o go negative like we saw in residential construction and I think that is, that is probably weigh down the Mechanical Access performance a bit lower than it has in the last couple of quarters, but that said that strong momentum that we have in the fundamentals there is going to help us continue to have a very good ’08, we would think even though we expect to see some market slowdown, all of that which has been built into the overall guidance for the Company.
Eric Bosshard: And then a follow up, I think Bostitch, things are changing pretty rapidly right now in regards to the cost side of the equation but can you talk about the expectation of getting to this 12% margins over eight quarters is… should we be thinking about a different schedule at this point or do you do anything different to ensure that you do stay on schedule?
John F. Lundgren: Yes. That’s really fair Eric. There’s enough uncertainty in the marketplace. Let me just say we are not thinking about it any differently. We think and the reason being… we think we have as much to gain as we do to lose with the pricing follow on to the anti-dumping legislation but it is going to take us three to six months to see for Denise [ph] to entertain to see where that settles out in the marketplace. In terms of everything we can do internally we think we have done it, it’s on track, it’s really good to see it. We are producing tools in both Taiwan and China. That’s very, very encouraging so one answer to that simple question is we are not backing off that and if something sculls in the marketplace or executionally that would allow us to do that we would be the first to raise our hands, but we are still looking at our… we are hoping and targeting a double digit run rate exiting 2008 for that business in terms of operating margin.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James
Sam Darkatsh: Good morning, gentlemen. How are you?
John F. Lundgren: Hey Sam.
James M. Loree: Hey Sam.
Sam Darkatsh: Couple of real quick questions here. Chimera’s structuring actions in ’08. What are your expectations there?
John F. Lundgren: At the moment what we are looking at is something that is going to be, I think fairly similar to ’07, so that would be something in the mid teens. If the recession gets deeper, we could do more but if we do more, it will be, it should be relatively neutral to earnings because the benefits from those re-structuring would be reflected at least partially in the current year, ’08 P&L.
Sam Darkatsh: Got you. Second question, I think I heard you say share count assumption for ’08 would be 82 million shares, but right now with the action that we are taking earlier this month, it is actually under 80. Option creep is that much or I am confused as to why you wouldn’t just assume 80 or 81 share count.
James M. Loree: Well, when the stock goes back up to 64, we will lose a couple of million shares or add a couple of million shares of the outstanding… that’s the game plan here is to execute, be rewarded by higher stock price and then we will go from there, so it is a bit of a tongue and cheek response but the Company is undervalued right now. Our expectation is the price will go up. That will create share creep and the last thing we want to do is have that impact our ability to deliver the earnings so that’s the reason for the guidance being constructed that way.
Sam Darkatsh: I’ll be sure to put that on my mind. A last quick question John, this is for you. Because you go through Europe, looking at it broadly from 30,000 foot on a consumer industrial combined basis where you’re seeing changes in growth rates on a country by country basis. I mean, if France is were your biggest exposure is but are you starting to see things weaken or are there… is it looking to be pretty steady and stable at this point?
John F. Lundgren: No. l… we’re…  Jim, this is John. Jim and I are obviously in daily contact with all the key regional leaders, even country by country you’re absolutely right. France and the UK provide the overwhelming majority of our business, we’ve seen no softening on the industrial or consumer side at this stage. Germany is booming which is an opportunity for us, we don’t have a lot of business in Germany, but it’s… growth from a low base and I can’t under emphasize the extent to which the opportunity to grow and I’ll call them emerging former central European markets. It’s filling in a lot of holes. Remember we’ve got good production in Poland, we’ve got teams on the ground there and that’s still in a lot of the… what we call it former Western European gap or potential softness. So, we’re cautiously optimistic on the European outlook and maybe for the first time in my career, Europe for a variety of reasons, this is going to follow the U.S. one way or another, at least you’ve read as much about that as we have. So, simple answer to this question is we are all over in terms of staying current. We’re not building much of a slump into our assumption.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Delabase [ph] with Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst: I’m asking questions on behalf of Nigel Coe today. How are you?
John F. Lundgren: Good Nicole.
Unidentified Analyst: Quick question for you on FatMax. Where are you guys on the roll out both in the U.S. and international.
John F. Lundgren: FatMax is… I don’t want to say yesterday’s news. But, that at this stage is one step behind what we call FatMax’s Xtreme in the U.S. and XL in Europe and simply said, Nicole, where we’ve said we’ve been and we will continue. We are two thirds of the way through a previously announced sequential roll out. That’s roughly two waves of new product introductions per year in the spring and fall which is the best selling seasons for relatively low priced consumer hand tools. And we have had tremendous success in terms of the shipments of those products, in two areas the POFs for the retail takeaway for the XL and for the extreme is up mid single to low double digit rates with less FatMax cannibalization than we’ve seen in the past. So, looking forward what you can expect is until we say something differently, or get further ahead of ourselves in terms of announcements. Another two ways in 2008, the only difference being we’ll do it simultaneously in the U.S. and Europe, historically we’ve trailed in Europe, but we think we have our supply chain to the point now where we can do them simultaneously, and we are looking for another $20 million, $30 million of growth from those new product introductions and the question will be, can we keep the cannibalization of the base FatMax line as well as it’s been so, the overwhelming majority of that becomes incremental.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan.
Michael Rehaut: Hi, thanks good morning.
John F. Lundgren: Morning Mike.
Michael Rehaut: First question, just on CDIY. Can you just break out what was the rest of the world excluding FX?
John F. Lundgren: Yes. 5% less than… you want the quarter or the year?
Michael Rehaut: Quarter please.
John F. Lundgren: 19%.
Michael Rehaut: So that was, okay that was excluding the benefits. And also what was the benefit on the margin line from currency?
John F. Lundgren: Probably 100 basis points, but I don’t have it at the top of my head, we actually… we think it would be a pro rata percentage, but I don’t have that number out of the top of my head. Jim might be able to give you better estimate.
James M. Loree: The 19% is half currency and half organic growth just to clarify.
Michael Rehaut: Okay.
James M. Loree: And I missed the second part of your question because I was busy researching…
Michael Rehaut: No actually I think that was my fault. I think you did say previously, it was a one to two million currency benefit.
James M. Loree: Right.
Michael Rehaut: The second question just on ’08. You had mentioned that you are expecting a kind of a decent backdrop. It’s a little bit in contrast to some economists that are looking for a little bit of a slow down and in the housing markets in the extent that certainly, you are a lot less exposed to the housing markets but particularly driven by housing market down 5% on average in terms of completions across a lot of G-7 type nation. So, is your outlook or your game plan in Europe, mostly end-market tied or do you also have kind of new product share gain initiatives that would bolster your confidence of Europe?
John F. Lundgren: Well based on performance in the U.S. it down turned to 20% set us down 5%. We operate the same business model in Europe. On the CDIY side is that you said to… It’s in response to Nicole’s question. We've got two more waves of excel coming in Europe. They’ve been extraordinarily successful. So, we think the fact that our new product vitality on the consumer side. That’s what’s allowing us to gain share in a down market because of very high percentage thus far. 60 to 80 of its been incremental. Not a lot of cannibalization from the base business and Jim made a very important point earlier. Why we were far from bullish, Mike, but while we're cautiously optimistic. Despite the weakness of the dollar. The strengthening of the… of our if you will the Chinese currency relative to the dollar, relative to Europe. It’s going to have a big impact. Private Label’s a big piece in Europe. Whether it’s generic or Private Label with an European home center. The cost of those products are going to go up dramatically. We're the market… we're number one or two in the market in every product category where we compete and with a lot of experience and a variety of branded products, in situations like this the market leader is quite often the one who gains as SKU’s are rationalized et cetera. We have this, I think, a chance to gain as much as we have to lose. That’s what provides, if you will a floor to our believe that despite some market headwind we think we can, we can grow a little bit and maintain our margins even in the European market.
Michael Rehaut: And just one last question. You kind of highlighted your ability to recover some of the cost inflation this year pretty effectively at least on the industrial side. A little bit more competitive on the CDIY side. I was wondering if you could give us your outlook for ’08 and that as well what’s big then--?
John F. Lundgren: Sure.
Michael Rehaut: And in terms of incremental raw material cost inflation and if you're… given that, it would likely to be up. Have you already started to be concerned in certain pricing initiatives in your different businesses?
John F. Lundgren: The answer is yes. Jeff touched on it. I’m going to turn it over to him. But we're looking at slightly more raw materials inflation and about the same percentage of recovery in the same place. But I think, Jeff can give you a little more granularity on that. I think, it’s important that you have it looking out at our guidance. Because we’ll update it if it changes.
Michael Rehaut: Yes. I mean the numbers.
James M. Loree: Those are the numbers and of the 75 or so that I mentioned when we did the guidance page.
John F. Lundgren: About 50 or so is actually materials. A lot of those materials are sourced from China so we're having the currency impact. We're having the EDRR impact. We're having the wage inflation impact. And we have pretty good visibility too. We have a centralized sourcing operation, which has very good, which has written contracts with these big suppliers et cetera and we kind of know where we are. We have a lot of our contracts have been finalized for ’08 and no, we have some freight inflations and wage inflation and some energy inflation on top of that and that accounts for the 75.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Banc of America.
Seth Weber: Hey, good morning.
John F. Lundgren: Good morning, Seth.
Seth Weber: Back on the security business, on the last call you guys talked about, I think, adding somewhere between or targeting 3 to 6 new cities for the HSM business and that kind of contributing to pretty robust organic growth rates. Is that still the case and can you talk about whether the competitive… the pricing environment in that business has changed here with the economic outlook?
John F. Lundgren: Yes and no. We still continue… we are targeting between 3 and 6 or roughly one a quarter cities to add, as we get confident we can have the scale to run a profitable operation. The no, is that is not the primary contributor to the HSM growth. I’d say with 70 field offices these are going to be much, much smaller offices. The primary contributor to our growth is continuing to execute the reverse integration that Jim described in quite a bit of detail and continue the trend to increase the percentage of recurring revenue i.e. the service piece of the business that comes along with the installation. Executing the of say the HSM model where its unlikely if not inconceivable, that we would do an installation without the monitoring and/or service contract that came with it. That’s what’s the driver of the organic growth.
Seth Weber: Okay. And any change to the pricing environment in that business and can you also just, going back to the Home Depot situation, should we expect another quarterly differential in this quarter and when will that kind of stop?
John F. Lundgren: Lets take them one at a time. The Home Depot situation which relates to the hardware business is in mechanical and that is roughly a $40 million impact in total and a $30 million impact in ’08 and it will anniversary after the third quarter is complete so the fourth quarter will have completely anniversaried that issue. And you can expect it to be, hardware is a vending machine business so in theory so, it’s pretty evenly spread throughout the first three quarters. And you want do the other part of the question Eric? And just repeat the other part of your question.
James M. Loree: The second part. Oh, Seth won't be able to.
Eric Bosshard: OK.
James M. Loree: I think, it was the pricing, I’m sorry, it was the pricing environment on the…
Eric Bosshard: On HSI?
John F. Lundgren: And quite frankly no is the simple answer. It’s a service business, it’s a very small part of an operator’s cost and the cost of failure is so high compared to the cost of doing it right. And I think by maintaining the current reputation we have as the premier service provider in the industry it’s obviously a competitive business but we do not see tremendous competitive pricing pressure particularly on the service side of that business.
Operator: You’re last question comes from Robert Wertheimer with Morgan Stanley.
Robert Wertheimer: I’ll try to be brief. On CDIY just wanted to ask about margins by geography stripping out Bostitch. Is there any material in other words are margins higher or lower overseas versus the US?
James M. Loree: No. In lots of businesses they are but in ours margins are quite similar and we anticipate seeing the same going forward. The team works hard to keep it that way. We manage it as a global business from a product development and a pricing prospective so that in itself is part of the reason but the simple answer to your question is no. They’re very consistent.
Robert Wertheimer: Thank you very much. And the second question, I’m just curious whether the economic uncertainty has an impact on your acquisition strategy? You have a lot of cash to deploy, especially I guess you’re taking a slightly more positive view on Europe. And does that uncertainty reduce or change your appetite for acquisitions? New ones.
John F. Lundgren: Go ahead Gerry.
Gerry Gould: Yes, well we look at this both tactically and strategically. And strategically there’s no difference whatsoever. Our strategy remains as we presented it on March 8, and supplemented it in discussions and various conference calls afterwards. From a tactical prospective there’s always a trade off that one has to make in our positions when looking at buying oneself versus spending the next $100 million to buy an acquisition. And as I said we’re trading at 7.6 times EBITDA and that’s a fairly compelling evaluation on a historical basis, on an intrinsic basis, on almost any basis you can derive. So, we’re not saying that we’re out of the acquisition hunt because we’re not, but yet when we look at the shares trading and the levels they have been trading it’s really difficult to get really excited about spending nine or ten times EBITDA doing all the work to take out the cost and everything to get it so that your buying it at basically seven to eight times EBITDA when you can buy yourself at really, with buying exactly, knowing exactly what your buying. So we’ll see. This year we could, we may not do any major acquisitions. We may focus purely on share buybacks, but, if a really compelling acquisition were to come around and we contracted the two, it looked like it was a smart move and it was strategically consistent then we would definitely go in that direction. So we’re keeping our options open, we’re staying flexible and we’ll see where we go.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to John for any closing remarks.
John F. Lundgren: Thanks Matthew. Two things. Just very briefly. We read over but we wanted to get virtually everybody in the queue. One point I just wanted to make. Numerous companies on calls earlier this, last weekend earlier this week, have had imposters calling in and I’ve abruptly dismissed the second caller which was not Richard Radbourne from Atlantic Securities. We know Richard well, he follows the company. And we simply removed his line because he signed on for someone he wasn’t. So, for anybody who thought that somebody was dismissed rather abruptly he was and in the future if they like to sign on as to who they are we’ll get then in the queue and if we don’t get to it during the Q&A Jerry is available always as he is. So, I just wanted to make that clarification. Second just a couple milestones before I close. Jim talked about the terrific performance of our industrial group. In general the Engineered Solutions in particular. We had our first shipments of our System 100 RFID enabled industrial storage unit. Really, really strategic, important product. And we're very exited about it in terms of our entrance into the healthcare segment. From the hydraulic side, good market strength, the business continues to grow. This business is almost twice as big as it was three or four years ago. And after a lot of joint development effort, our assembly technology’s business has received its first orders from Toyota Motors. And as you know a lot of those decisions are initially made in Japan before they cascade to the US. So we’re real pleased with some of those, I will say, small but strategically important milestones within our industrial storage business. Thanks for your interest on a call that we extended just so we could try to address everyone’s concerns. And we’ll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s Stanley Works conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2007 Q3  (2007-10-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Valerie and I will be yourconference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone tothe Stanley Works’ Third Quarter Conference Call. All lines have been placed onmute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will bea question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Mr. Gould you may begin your conference.
Gerry Gould: Okay. Thank you Valerie, and good morning everybody. On thecall with me this morning are John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO and JimLoree, our Executive VP and CFO. We've issued three press releases in the lastfew days; our fourth quarter dividend last Friday; the announcement of a newdirector on Monday; and this morning our third quarter results and our fourthquarter and full-year guidance. They are all on our website on www.stanleyworks.comin the Investor Relations segment. There is a presentation also, on our website and some PowerPointand PDF versions of charts that we’ll refer to during the call. They went up byabout 60 minutes ago, so please refer to those. John and Jim will review the quarter’s results and thenwe’ll have a question-and-answer period following that. The call should last aboutan hour. Beginning at 1.00 pm this afternoon, we’ll have replayavailable through next Wednesday, the end of Wednesday the 31st. Thereplay number is 800-642-1687, and this quarter the code that you need for thereplay is 201-99629. After that comes down next Wednesday, both the replay andthe presentation will remain on our website. Any questions, call me at 860-827-3833. And we just have twobrief announcements, and we are ready to start. First, in accordance with Reg G,we issued our earnings guidance at the beginning of the quarter as we did today,and we cannot comment on it thereafter. If it were to change materially, wewould issue a press release and conduct a conference call. And finally, certain statements contained in this discussionby the various Stanleyparticipants are forward-looking statements, as such, they involve risks. Actualresults may differ materially from those expected or implied, so we direct youto the cautionary statements in form 8-K, which we filed with today's pressrelease this morning. With that, I would like to turn the call over to JohnLundgren.
John Lundgren: Thank you Gerry,and I will provide an overview and then ask Jim Loree to look a little deeperinto some of the individual segment performances, as well as our fourth quarterguidance, which I will remind everybody, will be the last quarterly guidancethat we will issue. This is consistentwith our first quarter call 2007 we are beginning in January of '08. We willprovide an annual guidance and update that in the event of a material change. This quarter, in a large way validates the portfoliodiversification strategy that we initiated almost four year ago, and obviously wecontinue to pursue it today. Looking at the quarter, in summary, our CDIYbusiness and segment performed fairly well in a challenging domestic market,and the consequence of less dependence on some large US retailers didn't haveas large and adverse an impact that it might have, had our portfolio looked theway it looked four or five years ago. Strong CDIY performance in Europe, as well as our industrialtool group and our security segment, across the board, contributed to the goodresults in the quarter, which does enable us to re-affirm our full-year 2007sales EPS and free cash flow guidance that Jim can take you through in a lotmore detail. Quickly on the numbers, because you have them, it was arecord sales quarter for the Stanley Works, exceeding $1.1 billion. Pretaxincome was up 11%. Operating margins surpassed 15% and free cash-flow of $119million, was a 130% of net income. Strong performance in our industrial tool sector, across theboard, hydraulics Proto, Vidmar, Facom, all with very strong high-single orlow-double digit growth. Our mechanical security business had anextraordinarily strong quarter. Bostitch continues to recover, despite about50% of [DIY] markets being quite weak. Obviously the North American residentialsector is about 50% of what Bostitch does, it is industrial and is lessimpacted by market conditions. But that profit improvement program that we havediscussed in many occasions, remains on track. The HSM merger also is on track, and the legacy system integrationbusiness at Stanleyis still not performing at our expectations, but is clearly benefiting from thereverse integration into the HSM business model, which was one of primestrategic drivers behind that important acquisition. We grew across the board. All three regions of the worldshowed growth. And the combination of price and productivity more than offsetthe high inflation that we experienced during the quarter and this is the fifthconsecutive quarter, where that's taking place, which has an obvious positiveimpact on our margin achievement. Numbers in general, you see the $9, it was flat in line withour guidance of approximately $10. Operating margin, as I mentioned was up 100basis points, at 15.4% versus 14.4% a year ago. 700 basis points of increasedtax versus third quarter '06, which accounted for about $0.10 a share. The27.2% tax rate was only slightly or marginally above the midpoint of the rangewe provided in our guidance, but nonetheless 700 basis points up higher than ayear ago. Share count was not too different. It crept up 1.1 millionshares, as the performance of the stock over time has put more options in themoney, and the anticipated exercise of those options. So, EPS growth was constrainedby $0.10 in taxes, but all in all from an operating margin perspective, was agood quarter. Pre-tax income on operating margin both expanded. Pre-taxincome up 11%, operating margin up 20%, with a 15.4% operating margin, sodouble-digit growth in both of those key metrics were achieved. Looking at revenues in the next chart, and some of thevarious components, there was a 12% total increase in revenue, the biggestsingle contributor. About half of that was the HSM acquisition, but at $1.131 billion,these were record revenues for Stanley. Looking at the sources of growth, as most of you know, we donot include currency in our organic growth figures.  It did add 2% to the total topline, butgrowth across the board volumes contributing to 2% positive price, which is agood thing. 1% for 3% organic then 2% currency, so this is the split up betweenour core activities or activities that have been with Stanley for more than 12months,  and acquisitions was about equalleading to 12% growth in total. Looking at the segments, I won’t detract from what Jim isgoing to talk to you about in just a minute. But again, growth across the board:  Construction & DIY being flat organically,was 3% in total with that the positive impact of currency outside the U.S.Industrial segments were strong by all measures. Again, the difference betweenorganic, very strong at 8% and total, a large Facom business in Europe is benefiting from positive exchange rates. And security was way up, the combination of strong mechanical,great performance at HSM, slightly offset by a modest decline in the legacysystems integration business. So, record revenues were achieved for Stanley in the quarter despite the challenging NorthAmerican or U.S.retail market. Most of the numbers in the financial highlights, we'vediscussed either in the press release or I've touched on, but just veryquickly, in total, acquisitions added almost 70 million, clear theme whereextraordinary strength outside the U.S., market driven weakness in the U.S.,strong industrial across the board, and I've already touched on security.Margins grew nicely, again, up a 100 basis points, price productivity and ahigher margin HSM business included in the mix, all contributed to thatimprovement. Pre-tax income, as previously said, double-digit growth,good margins in security, higher tax rate and positive cash flow, and Jim isgoing to give you some more granularity on that in just a minute. So it's an important chart, it’s something that we look aton a regular basis in terms of the differentiation among, at least Stanley insome of its peers, and again, we go -- we look at this pretty regularly toensure that we are on the right task. But, it re-affirms again that the weakAmerican, certainly residential constructions markets, not necessarilyindustrial, continue to impact about 25% of our revenues, and specifically atthe top of the chart. The Construction & DIY segment in the Americas, ourTools and Storage business is down 11%, Stanley, Bostitch down 4%, the weightedaverage of those two are combined to about 25% of our sales, down about 9%, andthe other 75% of the portfolio up 7% organically with good performance,industrial across the board, security across the board and CDIY outside NorthAmerica. So, despite two large businesses in North America, we arehaving some very serious market headwinds that we won't dwell on, that we’rereading about everyday, and we anticipate, you know, will be no different orare not much different until midway through the second quarter of next year. Nonetheless, organic sales grew 7% in the remainder of theportfolio, contributing this in positive growth overall. Let me turn over to Jim who is going to take you throughsome of the segment detail and the outlook for '07.
Jim Loore: Thanks John. As we’ve said in the release, it really was astory of industrial insecurity. Really strong performances, but we had to holdon our own in CDIY segment to put it all together, and that's exactly what theydid. With revenues up 3% to $457 million, that included 3 points of currencybenefit, and we did that with a minus 8% organic growth in the Americas, whichwas very, very difficult market conditions, as John mentioned, and I think avery good performance and certainly some share gain going on there to achievethat in the US with a strong new product introductions that we have and thestrong execution. But the real story in CDIY, this quarter, was international,with double digit growth in Europe, Australia,Latin America, Asia, virtually everywhere, weare in markets around the world. We had strong growth and good growth in Canada,and it wasn't all currency, there was definitely some new product introductiongains in those major markets that we participated. That revenue performance allowed us to basically hold ourown with a modest decrease in segment profit down 5%, and a slight decline inthe segment profit rate, down to what I would consider a more normalized levelof about 16.8%. So all in all, an excellent performance for this segment in avery difficult market. Hand tools and storage was up 7%, and again the story wasthe strength internationally, and particular Europe, offsetting the weak Americas.The European folks in our Construction and DIY hand tools and storage business,were up 25% and that truly was an extraordinary performance driven by newproduct introductions and increased brand support. The margin decrease was alsoaffected by, and the overall segment was affected by some mixed stores,mechanic tools, and storage that we mentioned. Point of sale performance in the U.S. was down 5%, so sell-throughof the product down 5%. So actually inventories came down a little bit for thecustomers in the quarter and we note that in FatMax. And FatMax Xtreme point ofsell-through was up 7% at the North American retailers. That is a sample oflargest customers, the seven largest customers that we do business with, herein the Americas. The rest of the world, as I mentioned, the sales werestrong, up 23% and Bostitch sales were down slightly, nominally down 1% andagain the story was international with Europe up 12% and the U.S. was downabout 4% in Bostitch. And the profit and improvement initiatives in that businessremain on track. We said a couple of quarters ago, that we expected somesequential improvement, about a point a quarter, and they are holding to thatimprovement. So, the teams up there at East Greenwichare continuing to move that business in the right direction. So, moving on to industrial, it's truly a great story here.A strong, strong performance, revenue is 13% to $300 million, segment profit up46% to $42 million and 320 basis points of expansion in the segment profit rateto almost 14%. Industrial and automotive repair tools, which consist for thispurpose of Proto, MAC and Facom was up 8%, including 5% organic growthperformance. We had terrific strength in the Proto industrial business inthe America's up 11% and Facom was up 7% organically on strong new productintroductions and a solid integration continuing in that business. And as John mentioned, the engineered solutions businessesalso benefited from exchange, but had some really solid organic growth up 16%on total, and they were up almost 30%. And we had double-digit growth in thesmall business, the Vidmar high-end storage business, assembly technologies andthe hydraulics business. We had a good story on price realization, where favorablepricing more than offset our cost inflation in this segment and certainlyproductivity added to profits as well. And as I mentioned, the folks at Facomare doing a great job on the integration and not only are the revenues comingin as we expected, it got a little bit better. But the synergy realizationcontinues to be in line with expectations. Moving on now to security, another great story here, withrevenues up 24% to $374 million, segment profit up 34% to $69 million and otherexpansion in segment profit rate up a 130 basis points to 18.4%. The story here was twofold. First, an excellent performanceby the Mechanical Access business, which tends to be North American-centric. Wehad 7% sales growth in that business with strong orders and productivity in theautomatic doors business, but also good solid performances across the board inmechanical access solutions, including the old BEST Access, commercial locksand lock set business. Again, as the order book is strong in the business, theoperating margin is now north of 20%. The price realization and productivitygains are strong as well, and the non-ferrous metal inflation, is well though abatingsomewhat is still with us, but the price is more than offsetting there rightnow, and the productive is actually added to the margins. And then the other story in security is the ConvergentSecurity business where we had 62% sales growth, all of that driven by HSM, amodest decrease in the remaining part of the business, excluding HSM. Thatmodest decrease was driven by a sales decline in the United States SystemsIntegration business, which is, as we expected as we wean ourselves off theunprofitable types of business that we were working on previously there, andintegrating that business into the HSM business model. The team is in place to manage that integration, and it’sgoing well. And the good news there in the US Systems Integration business isthe operating margin was up $6 million on a sequential basis, which is movingin the right direction. And now turning to cash flow, another good story here. Asolid, solid quarter, $130 million in operating cash flow, $119 million in freecash flow, brings us to a year-to-date figure of $326 million for operating and$271 million for free cash flow, and that puts us solidly in position toachieve our forecast to $400 million to $450 million for the year.  And we will expect to see some workingcapital improvements in the fourth quarter that are built into our thoughtprocess there. And then turning to the full-year and fourth quarterguidance, really nothing different here. We expect the fourth quarter to be inline with previous expectations and that's the full-year, 2% organic sales inthe fourth quarter, which is in line with what we have accomplished eachquarter this year. Acquisitions contributing 6 points total, 8 points of salesgrowth, the earnings per share of a $1.10 to a $1.15 that will give us a 6% to11% earnings per share growth with some significant tax headwind which you cansee on the chart there. It looks like about $0.15 to $0.18 headwind is still todeliver this earnings growth. The free cash flow $130ish to $180 million, will get us tothe 400 to 450, and when you step back and look at the year in light of thevery difficult United States Construction & DIY market, we expect toregister 15% to 17% earnings growth, and that goes to the strength of the portfoliothat we started this conversation at the beginning talking about, how thatportfolio has shifted. And if we go to the next chart here, the portfolioshift, you can see, back in 2002 when we were $2.6 billion, we had $1.7 millionof Construction & DIY. So the majority of the portfolio revenue base coming fromthat Construction & DIY segment back in ’02 now; today a very similarnumber, $1.8 billion coming from Construction & DIY, but we have grown thesecurity business from $300 million to $1.4 billion during that timeframe, andthe industrial from $600 million to $1.3 billion and as a consequence we have amuch more balanced portfolio. And then the other point that I would make here is thatbecause the Construction and DIY segment are mostly geographically diversesegments. And you saw that in the results today that we only have $1.1 billionof exposure to the United State Construction and DIY market and [.700 million]in the rest of world. So that geographic diversification within the Constructionand DIY segment has helped us this quarter and we think it will continue tohelp us as we go forward here. So we have a larger and more diverse revenue base, and thatreally did help us drive performance throughout the year and we'll expect tocontinue to see that in the fourth quarter. Moving to the next chart, you can see a pretty good yearwhen we step back and look at some other key variables such as free cashflow.  It looks like about an 11% to 25%increase there, pretax income about a 25% increase. Operating cash flowconsistent increases as well there, and then EBITDA should grow about 25% thisyear. So on pretty much all fronts, including our earnings pershare with that 15% to 17% growth expectation, it looks like its going to be apretty good year and it looks like, despite the difficulties in the UnitedStates Construction and DIY housing related markets, that our portfolio iswithstanding them very well and we'll continue to do so as we go forward. With that we'll opening up for our questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Yourfirst question comes from Michael Rehaut.
Ray Huang: Hi guys, this is actually RayHuang on for Mike. How are you doing?
John Lundgren: Okay.
Ray Huang: Just had a couple of questions,first on the price realization. You got to expect that to continue goingforward to the fourth quarter and into the next year and by how much?
Jim Loree: Well, it will definitely goforward into the fourth quarter and it will help the fourth quarter. We arelooking at inflation in the total year of around $70 million now and we'llrecover about 80% of that in terms of our price realization. Price realizationhas grown to be a fairly good competency of the company over the past few yearsand certainly this year its been a pretty good year in that respect. Part of itthough, part of the higher percentage then will be typically, I mean typicallyhave been in the 60% to 65% realization range for the last couple of years. And I think the reason we aredoing a little bit better this year, is that the -- we are gaining somepositive effect from the non-ferrous inflation subsiding a bit as we go, tryingto go throughout the year and price increase, lag the inflation. So, we'rehaving a little bit of benefit from, of that lag effect, which we thought wouldcome soon or later, it looks likes it's coming. Nothing really significantthere, but I think in the fourth quarter we'll -- we should be, maybe the firstquarter where we are very close to a 100% price realization vis-à-vis our inflation. And when you look at it on asegment basis, its interesting, because we continue to -- that lag effect isclearly occurring in the Security business and in the Industrial business wherewe are recovering a little bit more than 100% of our inflation, but really justcatching up for inflation that we experienced in the past and in the CDIYsegment unfortunately due to the structural characteristics and difficulties inachieving price increases in that segment. The price realization percentage ismuch lower. We would be without that segmentkind of waiting the mix down, we would probably be right out around the 100maybe even slightly above 100% as we sit here today.
Ray Huang: Okay, so you guys are stilltracking that 70 million in raw material inflation that you guys had previouslygiven.
Jim Loree: Yes, no change from that and atleast based on the last 3 months worth of data.
Ray Huang: Okay and then onto the follow-upon Bostitch, simply you guys are on-track there, but where you guys versus whatyour initial expectations were in a couple of quarters ago and how did thatprogressing over the next 12 months or so?
John Lundgren: No, that’s fair. As Jim said weare at in fact slightly ahead and it's not going to be perfectly linear. Ithink we were pretty clear starting a year ago we said 100 basis points aquarter for 8 quarters, that gives you 800 basis points and takes margins fromvery low single-digits up to low double-digits. We are slightly ahead of it,it's not perfectly linear as mentioned. In terms of the key projects we cantalk about some things that weren't public at the time, but the key projectsare what’s driving a lot of the improvement, specifically our plant in Chihuahua, Mexicois closed, that’s been a very good thing. Fastening production is primarilybeen relocate, what’s been relocated at three different facilities as you know,and else don't travel very well, they are heavy. And we moved that productionprimarily to East Greenwich, Rhode Island. Secondarily thePoland and the Lung Fung, China, concurrent with that move we are making goodprogress on our tool transfer from East Greenwich Rhode Island to both Taiwanand China with recent Besco acquisition again a very important element in theprofit improvement program, with the transfer of some less proprietary tools tolower cost markets importantly we own the company, we own the facility, it isnot outsourced, it is a Stanley Works production facility primarily in Taiwan, secondarily in China. So, specific models, at thebeginning of that curve have been transferred and the products working and theproducts are moving back to the various domestic markets. So, simply said, on-track it'sthree quarter in a row, where we have achieved what we said we would and as Jimsuggested and we would suggest from our most recent review Bostitch business.We continue to track it very closely, and our plan and what's picked into thefourth quarter guidance at our plans for next year or it will continue withthat pace.
Ray Huang: Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from KenZener with Merrill Lynch
Ken Zener: Good morning.
Jim Loree: Good morning.
John Lundgren: Good morning, Zen.
Ken Zener: I am interested in the Industrialmargins, which while up year-over-year. I am just trying to understand the kindof sequential decline. I am just trying to see about the mix for industrialistquote which is 13.9 versus 15.2 in the second quarter of '07, is that just kindof normal seasonality or can you kind of explain that a little bit?
John Lundgren: Sure, it's primarily one driver,and Jim who has got business specific detail in front of them. And I am notsure how much detail we want to go. The biggest single element is, August isnever a very high productivity month in France. We know how important Facomis. It's a third of the revenue and more than the third of the profit from thatbusiness. Last August of course we had tremendous synergies going on and theearliest synergy is hitting the bottom line. So, while the business with Facomremains extraordinarily healthy and wouldn't want to suggest anything to the contrary.August with vacation period etcetera, Europe in general, France in particular, is arelatively low productivity month usually results in under recovery of somefixed costs. And simply said, it didn't show up last year because theimprovements due to the synergies at Facom overwhelmed the lack of efficiencyor reduced efficiency. And importantly we still have eight French plans andmajor merging porter that all we need to do is plan it a little better andforecast at a little better. It is always existed. It just didn't show up lastyear because synergies overwhelmed the historical lack of fixed cost recoveryand French plans in August.
Ken Zener: Okay, and then I guess on the SecurityIntegration. I believe last quarter you guys said it was the business was down8% the second quarter, and sounds like it's kind of down the low single digitsthis quarter. Is that correct?
John Lundgren: That's correct. That's on the [electrophic]convergent fees, Ken.
Ken Zener: Exactly.
John Lundgren: Mechanical continues to do nicelywith low single-digit organic growth at improved margins. We would love to withall three businesses on the Mechanical side heading on most, if not allcylinders, but what we are speaking to is yes --
Ken Zener: But there you also said thatprofit was up $6 million. Was that quarter-to-quarter?
John Lundgren: That was sequential that Jimreferred to, second to third, and that’s primarily, you’ll recall, within theLegacy SI business, we had a tremendous backlog of best and profitable installationprojects, particularly in some corrections facilities around the world, wherewe didn’t do as good a job as we should have, in both, estimating cost toinstall and secondarily, bringing it in at the cost we estimated once weprovided an estimate that arguably was not competitive to begin with. We are Stanley, we are in thisbusiness for the long haul, we are going to honor those commitments to ourcustomers, that backlog at the end of the second quarter was dramaticallyreduced. We still have a few more and what we said on our second quarter callis they would be reduced. We are finished with them until the end of this year,but that’s the primary sequential driver. Quite frankly, continued strongperformance at HSM and fewer bad projects in the backlog to work through atLegacy Systems Integration.
Operator: Your next question comes fromNigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.
Nigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. Nicequarter by the way, I think you do admit some good numbers here, and it’s a verychallenging environment. Just want to focus on Industrial, particularly with EngineeredSolutions, 16% organic growth. Can you just talk about some of the drivers ofthat performance, and lot of my Industrials are talking about 4Q and 2008 beinga bit more challenging, could you maybe address that question as well.
Jim Loree: Sure, engineered solutions is amixture of several small businesses, anywhere from $60 million to $150 millioneach; within those businesses each one participates in a niche market. So forinstance Vidmar is in the high end storage business for industrial customers,military customers and most recently hospitals in the healthcare industry withthe acquisition of InnerSpace. And assembly is in the Automotive OEM business.And hydraulics happens to be in the scrap recovery and demolishing segments ofthe market. So, to extrapolate anythingdramatic about the state of the overall industrial economy would be verydangerous and difficult. However, fortunately for us the markets that wehappened to in are vibrant right now, and the value propositions that we havewithin these businesses are very good and strong. And I think in all caseswe’re either maintaining or growing share within those businesses. So, it’s a combination ofindustrial strength within certain niches that we are in. And on top of thatsome good performance. Now the one notable exception to that in terms of marketstrength would be the assembly, you know the Automotive business. And there isa couple of things going on there. Number one, there Europeanperformance was very strong in the quarter. So despite, you know, again the US wasin the Automotive industry. They did it very well in that regard. They had arelatively easy comp on top of that because it’s been down for a while. Andbasically the combination of those two factors and some good new products havehelped propel into a positive performance as well. So, no one story there, buthaving said that, we don’t see any significant weakness at all on theindustrial economy across the board. I am talking more in a general sense now.And I think the exports in the USare certainly robust that’s helping drive the industrial economy and theinternational aspects of the Industrial business are very strong as well.
John Lundgren: Nigel, let me just add one thingto Jim’s point because the segmentation is relatively new to the investmentcommunity. We have only been reporting this way, this is our third quarter andwithin Industrial. The largest distinction between what we call Industrial onAutomotive Repairs versus Engineered Solutions. Engineered Solutions representsabout 20% of our Industrial portfolio. That is they made to order versus a madeto stock business model. But all the businesses that Jimdiscussed, they tend to be larger ticket items, longer lead times and theinterest to simplification. More often than not it's going to come from the customer'scapital budget as opposed to his expense budget. Thus, we have a little longerlook into the future, in terms of open orders and things of that nature in thatbusiness. So, fundamental business modeldifference, made to order versus made to stock and beyond that obviously theyall compete in the same general environment. It's more an internal than anexternal thing, is why the Engineered Solutions segment showed more robustgrowth than Industrial in total.
Nigel Coe: Got it, thanks for the colorthere and just a quick follow-on HSM, I know it's not part of organic growth,but can you just talk about the organic growth there for the quarter?
Jim Loree: It's very consistent with what ithas been, the trend is in the right direction. It's in the 8% to 10% kind of arange and the good news about that business it has so much recurring revenuethat forecasting the revenue is a lot easier than say the CDIY segment nextweek. So in any event, business continues to be strong and trending in theright direction in HSM.
Operator: Your next question comes fromEric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.
Eric Bosshard: Good morning.
Jim Loree: Hi Eric.
Eric Bosshard: Two questions, first of all onthe Facom business, the 7% organic growth SFX seems like a heck of a number.What's going on in those markets and within market shares what’s driving thatand is that sustainable over what period of time?
Jim Loree: Well, the market itself Eric isnot on fire, certainly stronger than usual, so its probably you get probably2.5% economic growth going on in Europe right now, and these markets tend totrack the economy fairly closely, but compared to how Europe has beencontinentally or been particularly has been performing over the past few yearsthat's a slightly stronger pulse than before. The real story at Facom islargely one of new product introductions and Facom prior to Stanley's ownership was owned by a financial,in effect the financial portfolio company, company they don't fetch in and thenItalian commercial furniture company. So they are now part of a global toolcompany and a global industrial in Automotive tools platform and we didn'treally bank on any revenue synergies or anything else when we put the dealtogether, nor do we really count on those, but we are definitely getting someand in addition to that we are getting some geographic expansion into Centraland Eastern Europe. So combination of factors, thequestion about sustainability who knows certainly new product introductiondoesn’t turn on one quarter in the Industrial business and turn off the next,so I think we should have some sustained performance for a period of time,whether it will be at the levels that we have this quarter will be anotherquestion, but certainly we see no reason to become pessimistic about organicgrowth at Facom at this time.
John Lundgren: Yeah, Eric before you ask mesecond question because we now it works to get cut off in the queue. Just toexpand historically Facom's been outstanding at new product introduction. Ithink the internal improvements at Facom are simply our robust new productpipeline replaced all of the attrition from the core business thus the businesswas able to stay flat. What's happened with the Facom team that I think justimprovements that Jim talked about in their rhythm, in their metrics and howthey are managing the business is simply said, the new product introduction isnot 100% cannibalization or replacing lot business. So, they are maintaining alarger percentage of the core business and as a consequence, some of the newproduct introductions becomes net incremental and that’s really helping. Can wekeep doing that forever. It’s a long plan, but we like the way the business isgoing, we like the way it's managed and EQUIP AUTO which is largest Automotiveand Industrial show in Europe just took place.We were very pleased with the interest, the results with our position at EQUIPAUTO in Parisin late October. So, for the short-term future things look good at Facom.
Eric Bosshard: And then lastly, it seems thatthis is your last quarterly guidance. Within the 4Q guidance, my number suggestthat you probably need to have some profit growth out of the CDIY which isdifferent than what you showed in the 3Q. Can you just give a little sense ofwhat you expect the profit comparison to be in that segment and 4Qyear-over-year and why?
Jim Loree: Well, I will tell you, Eric. Wedon’t, we are not in the business of giving guidance by segment anyway eventhough we still give quarterly guidance. But what I will say is that, we expectthe fourth quarter to look and also lot like the third quarter in the sensethat CDIY will most likely be a kind of a strong base and not particularlystrong in terms of growth but solid in terms of not eroding. And thenIndustrial and Security we are expecting very strong quarters out of them aswell in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes fromPeter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird.
Peter Lisnic: Good morning gentlemen.
John Lundgren: Hi, Peter.
Peter Lisnic: I guess first question would beon Security. If you look at the legacy Convergent portfolio, you mention thesequential profitability improvement. But can you give us a sense as to whatthat would mean on a year-over-year basis or where we were at in terms of justthe underlying margin in that business right now?
John Lundgren: Yeah. I guess as Jim just said,Pete in all fairness, not only are we’re going to forecast or talk revenue andmargin by segment. We’re certainly not going to talk to it by sub-segment. Wehave no intention on an open conference call of talking Legacy Convergent,Security margins versus HSM versus anything else. What we’ve said we’ve been very-- about HSM is obviously mixing up Security in a meaningful way. A businessthat was certainly a drag on profitability, you know, round numbers it's 350million of the $600 million segment. So, you can do the math on what 6 millionin one quarter did. Going forward we see the reversed integration of the LegacySI business into the HSM model continuing to affect performance and that’swhat's build into our guidance. Importantly, the change wassimply we have a better with the help and one of the strategic justificationsof HSM a far better cost estimating tool, far better project managementcapabilities and the elimination of the backlog, you know, all of those aswe’ve said in the second quarter impacted the third quarter positively we’llcontinue to impact the fourth quarter. That’s why we bought HSM and right nowwe got 15% plus operating margin business and we continue to believe it's thereand can go up from there, but we just aren't in a position and it's not in ourbest interest to provide any more granularity than that.
Peter Lisnic: No I understand that, I just wastrying to get a ballpark of whether or not you are seeing improvement and howmuch but second question. So thanks for that answer. Second question, in termsof the Mechanical Access business, I think I had the same question what Ericjust asked on Facom and that is it looks like 7% plus in the first half orfirst three quarters of the year. And Jim you mentioned strength on all threeof the businesses. Just can give us a bit more coloron how that's happening and do you expect that to continue and how?
Jim Loree: We don't expect to continue at 7%for the intermediate term that's for sure because it's a 3% to 4% market growthstory. If we can get Mechanical to grow 3% or 4% the real growth in the futurefor this segment above line average will come from the Convergent business andMechanicals job is to grow 3% to 4% and generate a lot of profit and lot ofcash and help us fund the expansion, of the platform into other geographies andso forth. That said, there is lot of, a lotof good things going on in the organic growth area in Mechanical. We are verystrong in the Education and Healthcare markets. They both happen to be goodmarkets to be in right now. Where gaining some shares in the CommercialConstruction market because all of the fact, that we have more specifiers thanwe use to and that's gradually starting to have a positive impact and we alsohave a full product line and you recall that in the last few year we purchaseda few companies that have enabled us to round out our product line in Mechanicalaccess. And some of the competition prior to the fact that we have this, now wehave this full product line, but prior to that some of the competition wastaking advantage in their pricing strategies by looking at low (volume), wherewe were competing with them and then making their moneys on areas where we didn'thave products and they are winning bids that way. That is not happening to theextent that it did before and that certainly is helping. The other factor there is theautomatic door business which has just been a tremendous growth story over thepast five to seven years, started out five to seven years ago it was $100million business, today it's between $200 million and $300 million and most ofthat has been organic growth and they have had enormous share gain. That has todo, we believe, with the superior products that they have and they continue todevelop new products in that particular business and also has to do with ourdistribution strategy, which is go-direct strategy and that enables us to servethe national accounts extremely well and we have gained share as a result. So, all of those factors I think arecombing to give us strong performance. And the other thing, it's an intangiblebut I believe it has something to do with this, is that we split these businessesfrom management perspective about a year ago and as it turns out the Mechanicalfolks now are able to focus much more on the nuts and bolts of organic sharegain and productivity and other things in their business and they don't have toworry about estimating cost in the Electronic business and project management,the Electronic business. I am trying to figure out how to grow the recurringrevenue base in the Electronic business in all thing and the technology changesin the Electronic business, and everything else there was potentially a bit ofdistraction before. So, I think increased focus has also contributed to thestrong performance in Mechanical access
John Lundgren: Pete, let me just add because youdidn't get everything you were looking for, I know in convergent, but infairness. Just, the third leg of course of our Mechanical Security Solutionsbusiness is builder's hardware. We talked about in February, talked about againin May, we lost a meaningful piece of business there and it is what clouds theoutlook and makes Jim or me hesitant to say yes of course, it will continuewith the rate. The good news is we lost thebusiness, we started to plan for it, that business has in fact wind down alittle slower than we thought and we've done a better job replacing the lostbusiness, and we gave ranges of what we thought that might mean in terms ofrevenue and income, and quite frankly we've lost the revenue a little bit andincome a little bit slower than we had anticipated in our outlook and we’rereplacing it with business that we know we can count on in the future a littlebit faster, still a lot of open books there. With the speed at which linereviews work and as Jim already talked about the architectural bidding process,and it's a little less than straight forward, but that too has contributed togreat performance of late, and it’s a little more difficult to predict theshort intermediate term future of that piece of the business. But all in, we'repleased with our decision to have split those businesses, fundamentallydifferent business models despite the great synergies between the two in termof install base.
Operator: Your next question comes fromSteven Kim with Citigroup.
Mark Montanan: Hi, this is Mark Montanan onbehalf of Steven. Regarding your recent acquisition, seems like you’re line upproduct offering on the Mechanical access is fairly complete, wondering isyou’re expecting to further add to your portfolio on the Mechanical side, orshould we expect more acquisitions coming on the convergent side going forward?And in particular are you still expecting to expand these future convergentacquisitions internationally. Thanks.
John Lundgren: Yeah. Well, I guess it was March8 when we talked specifically about some of the different strategies in thegrowth platforms so we have in Security and Industrial and Automotive tools.But, we have three growth platforms of which two are security and each ofthose, one is Mechanical and one is Convergent. And the growth strategies aresomewhat different, especially as it relates to the M&A growth. And you’re right; I mean we havea relatively complete now product line in Mechanical in North America,certainly there is no, there is no burning platform need to buy anything elseas product related doesn’t mean that there won’t be possible nicheopportunities that come up from time to time within Mechanical in NorthAmerica. But the real opportunity in themanagement team is well aware and strongly pursuing it for growth for mergerand acquisition growth in Mechanical is outside the borders of the United States,and that’s where they are focused on. And I suspect you probably will see somedeals there and all likelihood over the coming years. And when you think aboutthe strength of this business and profitability and the growth profileetcetera, it’s a nice business and it’s equally as nice in Europe as it is inthe US.But the products in the USdon’t just translate like the tool business translates into Europe.You have to, they are subject to different standards and you have to have localproducts. So, it makes it more challengingand it really does require sort of M&A approach to the non-US growthstrategy. So that’s Mechanical. In convergent, convergent has the opportunityto grow through acquisition as well. But I would say their growth strategy willlikely be more focused on organic. Not to say that we won’t acquire there’scertainly a lot of commercial monitoring companies that we could consolidateinto our business in a very successful and cost effective manner and it'slikely that we will do that, and it's also possible that overtime, there maybesome businesses outside the borders, of the United States that are attractiveto us, that will to a large extent depend on how well, the team is executing inNorth America making sure that the US Systems Integration business isstabilized and so forth. So before we go venturing toofar, beyond our borders we are going to make that we totally certain, that wehave the equation right, in the United States and the only way you can betotally certain is to get some quarters under your belt and make sure that theperformance is there. Clearly, we are moving in the right direction, and wewould expect to continue to do that.
Mark Montanan: Okay, great. And then a follow-upto previous question on the implications to the fourth quarter guidance andmargins holding up pretty fairy well. Is this, I am just wondering if this isparticularly due to the strong pricing that you mentioned earlier on theindustrial on Security segments? I know you said that CDIY is going to continueto be anchor there, are you expecting margins to really hold in place mainlydue to the pricing or is it something in particular of the time in anotheryear?
John Lundgren: No, it's kind of what we arelooking at about 2% organic growth where we are looking at strong productivity.We are looking at price and inflation roughly off setting each other. That meancombination of factors, such as that are really driving the outlook forcontinued in a positive performance. Certainly the market conditionswere not betting on any improvement in any market conditions, I can assure youof that.
Operator: Your next question comes fromSeth Weber with Banc of America.
Seth Weber: Hi good morning, my questionshave all been asked and answered thank you.
Jim Loree: Thanks Seth.
John Lundgren: Thanks Seth.
Operator: Your next question comes fromDavid McGregor with Longbow Research.
David McGregor: Yes, good morning. Just on thetopics for organic growth at HSM. Can you talk about your plans for 2008 withrespect to opening new offices and how that could contribute to organic growth?
John Lundgren: Yeah, there are David, three tosix regions where we feel we are not top cities, quite frankly, where we feelwe are not perfectly suited to compete. The best way to not make money or losemoney in this business, as I am sure you understand, is to how folks drive in threeor four hundred miles to service a commercial account. So I won’t name thecities, but three to six are on the radar screen for having enough critical mathbetween the Legacy Stanley Systems Integration business in HSM, to open anoffice there and as there is consequence to staff with two to four field techs,and that is quite frankly to eliminate the cut drive time from four hours toone hour to allow us to grow organically in that market. It probably overall would come,but we still have some redundancy in our field operations, as you might expectcombining the HSM locations with the Stanleylocations. We have done a really good job so far Brett Vontrager, Tim Wall andthe team. They have done a very good job in terms of choosing the rightlocation and the tough decisions, the best of the best in terms of the peoplewhere if you got two-ten person offices in a city that becomes a 15 personoffice. So, long answer to a simple question, look for three to six new citiesnext year, which we think will help contribute to the organic growth. We thinkit's necessary. We continue, the biggest help to organic growth of course iskeeping attrition at or below industry standard levels, where we are with HSM.That’s what Tim Wall and the team wake up every morning, not just looking fornew business, but working real hard to ensure that they retain every existingcustomer, that’s a profitable customer. And if there is any chance of losing itfor whatever reason, we work extra hard to keep that from happening, which iswhy attrition is well below our industry standards in that business and areworking hard to drive it even lower.
David McGregor: And it's impressive as 8% to 10%growth is, is it possible that with these 3 to 6 openings that might be on thescreen of '08 that we could see organic growth moving higher from 8% to 10%next year.
John Lundgren: David, anything is possible, isthat built into our guidance? The answer is no, as much as we would like to, wedon’t operate in a vacuum, there are people out there actually after those samecommercial accounts as we are. Some of whom are a lot bigger than we are, sothe simple answer is, that’s just part of our on-going practice. We think weneed to do that to keep up with the kind of growth we’ve experienced in thepast. It will naïve for us, you or anyone else to think that for whateverreason, consolidations of the customer base, that their wont be some attrition.And remember, when there is, whether it’s three or five or 8%, even if you areon the low end of that, 3% to 5% attrition means you need some new business inexciting markets or you need some new cities to back fill that before youbreakeven. The best part of the HSM model asJim suggested earlier, is the high base and increasingly high percentage of therevenue that’s recurring. When you get more than 50% of your revenue baserecurring, that is an annuity, and at least a year in advance that businesswill be with you, and that’s where our focus is, on HSM. But we will take anyupside that that team can deliver, they’ve done nothing but pleases with theconnectivity and their performance so far, but it would not be prudent for usto expect any more from and making a lot of things going on, and they’reoperating in an intensely competitive market.
Operator: There are no further questions.I’ll turn it over to John Lundgren for final comments.
John Lundgren: I want to thank, just nothingelse to say in terms of the numbers, they are out as always as Gerry isavailable for a follow-up if somebody didn’t get it. There is a lot going on inthe market this morning and a lot of calls coming out. So, thanks to all of you who tookthe time to listen in and for those who didn’t get to you know it’s a availablethis starting 1 o'clock this afternoon. Thanks a lot.
Operator: This concludes today’s conferencecall. You may now disconnect.
