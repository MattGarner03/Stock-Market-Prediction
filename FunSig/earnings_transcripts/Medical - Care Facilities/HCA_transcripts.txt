===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Mike Marks. Sam and Mike will provide some prepared remarks, and then we'll take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. The solid fundamentals we have seen in our business over the past several quarters continued into the first quarter of 2025. This momentum generated strong financial results that were driven by broad-based volume growth, improved payer mix, and better operating margin. As we look to the rest of the year, we remain encouraged by our performance, the overall backdrop of growing demand for healthcare services, and the increased investments we have made across the company to serve our communities better. The people of HCA Healthcare also continued to deliver for our patients in key non-financial metrics, including improved quality outcomes, more efficient emergency room services, which have accelerated time to discharge, and increased satisfaction and finally, better inpatient capacity managed with reduced length of stay. I want to thank my colleagues for their professionalism, their dedication to our mission, and the great outcomes they produce for our company to start the year. As compared to the prior year, diluted earnings per share as adjusted increased more than 20% in the first quarter to $6.45. Same facility volumes, even with the leap year effect, were favorable and in line with our expectations. Inpatient admissions grew 2.6% year over year, equivalent admissions grew 2.8%, and emergency room visits increased 4%. Most of our other volume categories, including cardiac procedures and rehab admissions, also had solid growth in the quarter. Surgical volumes across the company were mixed. Inpatient surgeries were slightly up, and outpatient cases were down. Same facilities revenue grew almost 6%. The volume increases I just mentioned, coupled with approximately 3% higher revenue per equivalent admission, drove this growth. We continue to make progress on our cost agenda. Operating costs across most categories were in line with our expectations, and operating margin improved on a year-over-year basis. As part of our network development plan, we used our capital spending to increase the number of facilities or sites of care by about 3.3% to around 2,750, and we added approximately 2% to our inpatient bed capacity. Inpatient occupancy in the quarter was 77% as compared to 75% last year. As we move through the remainder of the year, we will focus on maintaining our operational discipline while continuing to invest appropriately in our strategic agenda. We believe this balanced approach should position the company favorably to meet our objectives. Before I finish my comments, let me address the current federal policy environment, which I know is top of mind. We are in a very fluid situation. While we have a general sense for the new administration's stated priorities, we do not have any specifics. It is unclear how these efforts might be carried out and what effects they may have on our business. We are very engaged in advocacy as it relates to health policy. Our general approach is to support reasonable reforms. However, we do not support reforms that harm coverage for families or individuals, nor do we support policies that compromise the ability for hospitals across the country to care for people in their times of utmost need. I know you would like us to size the potential impact of health policy risks and now tariff risks, but we are not comfortable with providing estimates at this time. We just do not have enough insight into what might happen. When we gain a better understanding, we will share more information as part of our quarterly earnings process. As you would expect, we are developing plans in the event we face adverse impacts. Our planning draws from the experiences we had during the COVID-19 pandemic and considers both adjustments to operations and how we may utilize the flexibility our cash flow and balance sheet provide us. As part of this planning process, we will maintain a long-term horizon and move forward with a sense of calm, steadiness, and confidence. We believe we can use our financial strength, mission-oriented culture, and can-do attitude of our people to navigate through this uncertain period and deliver the results our stakeholders deserve. With that, I will turn the call to Mike for more detail on the quarter.
Mike Marks: Well, thank you, Sam, and good morning everyone. We are pleased with the results of the quarter, which highlighted continued momentum and the strength of our operating performance. Sam covered our volume and revenue performance, so let me add a few notes on payroll. Payer mix remains strong with same facility managed care equivalent admission up 5.4% compared to the prior year quarter. As expected, Medicaid volumes began to flatten as the redetermination process ensues, with a same facility equivalent admission decline of only 1.4% in the prior year quarter. And given the strong enrollment growth in the exchanges, our same facility equivalent exchange admissions increased 22.4% over the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 110 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by operating leverage from our volume growth and strong cost management performance in the quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue improved 80 basis points, supplies improved 30 basis points, and other operating expenses were based core. Contract labor improved 9.3% from the prior year quarter and represented 4.4% of total labor costs in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 5.1% in the first quarter of 2024. Same facility professional fee cost increased 11% from the prior year quarter and were approximately flat sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.3% over the prior year quarter. You will recall that our guidance assumes the impacts of the 2024 hurricanes would offset each other in 2025 and not produce a tailwind for us. This is what played out in the first quarter. Earnings were flat year over year in our hurricane-impacted market in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the prior year quarter. I want to remind everyone that after considering Medicaid state supplemental payments and related provider tax, total Medicaid reimbursement does not cover our cost of caring for Medicaid patients. Considering Medicaid state supplemental payments and related provider taxes, in isolation, we saw an $80 million increase in net benefits in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to a reconciliation payment and a program accrual. Moving to capital allocation, we continue to deploy a balanced strategy of allocating capital for long-term value creation. Cash flow from operations was $1.65 billion in the quarter. There are a few factors that drove our cash flow from operations down year over year, all of which relate to working capital changes that are timing in nature. Capital allocation in the first quarter of 2025 included $991 million in capital expenditures, $2.5 billion in share repurchases, and $180 million in dividends. We also paid $227 million for acquisition with the close of the transactions for Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, New Hampshire, and Lehigh Medical Center in the Fort Myers, Florida area. Lastly, we received $161 million in proceeds from the sale of assets, primarily driven by the sale of Regional Medical Center of San Jose. This divestiture was an important component of our portfolio optimization. It was good for the community, and it will be accretive to HCA Healthcare. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage remains at the lower half of our stated target range, and we believe our balance sheet is strong and well-positioned for the future. As noted in our release, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for the full year 2025. I will now hand the call back to Frank Morgan for questions.
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Mike. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so we might give as many as possible in the queue an opportunity to ask a question. Abby, you may now give instruction to those who would like to ask a question.
Operator: Thank you. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star one a second time. If you are called upon to ask your question and are listening via speakerphone on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. Again, it is star one if you would like to join the queue. And your first question comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Ann Hynes: Hi. Good morning. I know you reiterated guidance, but are there any major changes in assumptions embedded in that reiteration of guidance? And within that, I know you talked about, Sam, in your prepared remarks that surgeries were mixed. Did you expect them kind of flat to down because of the tough compare due to leap year, or were they actually worse than your expectations? Thanks.
Mike Marks: Let's see. We've got this person. We'll talk about outpatient surgery, and so if I think about, you know, as Sam noted in his commentary, we're really pleased with the first quarter performance of the company. We continue to see solid volume growth. Revenue was in line with our expectations. And as I noted, we had strong expense. So as noted in our release, we did reaffirm guidance for 2025. You know, it's the first quarter, and really at this point in the year, we believe our guidance range continues to be appropriate for where we are. Certainly, as we progress through the year, we will, you know, continue to update you on our subsequent earnings calls. Specifically, the outpatient surgery, you know, we're really pleased in the first quarter with our outpatient revenue growth, which, you know, you take it in total, grew at a rate a bit higher than our inpatient revenue. Just as a reminder, we really categorized our outpatient revenue into four key categories: emergency services, outpatient surgery, which includes both hospital-based and our ambulatory surgery center platform, ambulatory, things like our physician clinics and our urgent care clinics, and other hospital-based services like cardiology, diagnostics, and observation. All four of our outpatient categories had revenue growth over the prior year quarter. On outpatient surgery specifically, we continue to see a slight decline in case volumes driven by lower acuity cases and by Medicaid itself. However, we had good growth in net revenue and earnings in our outpatient surgery business overall, inclusive of both hospital and the ambulatory surgery center category. I'll finish and just note that the leap year effect did impact the stated volume declines. If you think about outpatient surgery at a 2.1% same facility decline, on a per business day basis, that's about a 1% decline.
Sam Hazen: An inpatient, Mike, would be up about 1% per business day. So maybe a little softer, Ann, than we had expected, but the first quarter is always difficult to predict. Surgical period because typically the fourth quarter is active, and so you're dealing with respiratory implication and new deductibles and co-pays and so forth. But overall, we had solid volume activity across the company, and it was broad-based across our service categories. As we mentioned, our cardiac activity, on both surgeries and procedures, were strong inpatient and outpatient. Our rehabilitation, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, were strong, up over 4%, I think, on a same-store basis. Behavioral health was down, but behavioral health was down because we had repurposed quite a bit of the supply beds over the years and repurposed those for med surg in many instances. And so that was intentional in some facilities. Obstetrics volumes were up slightly even with the business day decline, and one wouldn't think that has an influence, but it does. So overall, we're pleased with our volumes. And we're encouraged by the market share gains that we're seeing across our company, and we believe we are doing the right things within each of our networks to develop them to meet the needs of the patients in the community.
Ann Hynes: Great. Thanks for the detail.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Pito Chickering: Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. And nice job in the quarter. Guess going to, you know, get to be leveraged this quarter, you know, pretty extraordinary. You know, the, you know, the growth you saw year over year, I guess. You know, how do you guys sort of get that much levered this quarter, you know, and, you know, going forward, you know, like, how do you get that productivity? Are you seeing turnover increase as you're sort of getting that level of productivity? Are you sort of behind the hiring curve? I mean, how should we think about that level of productivity looking forward, you know, after such a huge growth? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Okay. Pito, this is Sam. I'm not sure I understood that question completely. Let me speak to the operating leverage. And I think that's what you're referring to. I mean, fundamentally, our business is a fixed-cost business. We've said that over time, and the more volume we can push through the organization, the more operating leverage we create, the more contribution margin that generates, and it helps our overall profitability and margins. And we have regained, as we mentioned last year, our ability to create operating leverage. That shows up in labor costs. It shows up in some of our other operating expense categories. And we're able to do that again with a very mindful approach to our expenses and then at the same time, you know, using more of our asset base to absorb the volumes. With respect to our human resource agenda, we've continued to progress across the company. Our turnover on both nursing and non-nursing is less than it was year over year. Our contract labor utilization is down year over year. Overall engagement with our most recent engagement surveys with our employees was at a high watermark for us. And so we're very encouraged about what our human resource and operating teams are doing to create an environment where our people can succeed and deliver the outcomes that our patients deserve. We believe we can continue that, that the labor market in general is stable, and we have initiatives inside the organization and then outside, if you will, with our Galen School of Nursing and other workforce development initiatives to deliver the people that we need to serve the demand. The facility side, as I mentioned in my comments, is being satisfied by our capital spending that we're adding to our networks very deliberately on that front. And then we're using our workforce development, our engagement, and other HR initiatives to deal with the people side of that. So we're pretty encouraged by all aspects of our operations. Our teams are doing a wonderful job in dealing with the volume and translating that, as I mentioned, to quality outcomes, efficiency, and a great place to work for employees.
Pito Chickering: So, you know, with, you know, the SBA at level, you know, I guess, you know, like, 43.6. I guess since you've IPO, we have seen that just low. As your occupancy keeps on increasing, is it fair to think that a number can keep getting better to your point on the fixed cost leverage?
Sam Hazen: Well, I think generally speaking, yes. It can improve as we deliver more volumes on the asset base that we have. And we will continue to use technology. We use our benchmarking and other tools to find ways to create efficiencies, and we feel, you know, that we're in a pretty good spot and that we can leverage again the fixed cost that we have in our system to drive efficiency. Thanks so much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of AJ Rice with UBS. Your line is open.
AJ Rice: Hi, everybody. The revenue per adjusted admission up 2.9%, I think. It was strong, especially with surgeries off. Can you parse out a little bit more whether that was year-to-year improvement in DPP programs, rate updates generally, commercial mix, or anything? And then maybe just broadly commenting on what you're seeing in contracting with managed care. Is the debate in Washington having any impact on the discussions with managed care?
Mike Marks: Hey, AJ. Thanks for the question. This is Mike. I think about our net revenue per equivalent admissions, you know, the first thing I would call out is space. We continue to have the they would prepare trends, you know, as I noted in my opening comments. You know, Twodie continues to be good. In that regard as well. I think as I mentioned on the outpatient surgery comment, we actually had a little more outpatient revenue growth than we did on the inpatient side. And even on outpatient surgery, you know, the case decline that we saw was really driven by lower acuity cases. And from a payer mix perspective on the outpatient surgery side, continues to be driven almost entirely by Medicaid itself. So that payer mix influences on both the inpatient and the outpatient side. So generally speaking, I think we're in, you know, in good shape on network per equivalent emission in the quarter, and we were pleased with the performance in that way. On the payer side, I'll start, Sam, you please include, but, you know, we're over 90% contracted for 2025 as you would expect. We're over 75% contract for 2026, and call it 25% contracted for 2027. At rates that are really similar to the last couple of years and, you know, in context of our targets. We're also pleased with our contracting cycle. And our access to lives with payers are really higher than they've almost ever been. Both on the commercial side and on the exchange side. So, you know, our work with our payer partners continues. Our contract training, cycles continue to be productive, and I think we're off to a good start this year in terms of our net revenue per equivalent.
Sam Hazen: Yeah. And Mike, this is Sam, AJ. I think a couple of points are relevant here. You know, our inpatient surgeries as a percent of overall admissions was down 50 basis points. That's not meaningful in the overall revenue equation. I mean, obviously, we'd rather it be higher than lower, but only down 50 basis points. Our clinical care admissions were, yeah, at a really good position as it relates to total. So I think there are other aspects to acuity and their overall case mix, I think, was, you know, modestly up or you know? So all of that suggests that we still have the acuity within the larger population of our patients. With respect to the managed care contracting, our overall managed care positioning with respect to the contracts that we participate in has improved on a year-over-year basis. This year, we have two markets where we have added a very important contract to our overall portfolio or participation. In Denver, we are now a participating provider broadly with Kaiser Health Plan in the Denver, Colorado market. That's a very encouraging development. And then in Chattanooga, Tennessee, with Blue Cross of Tennessee, we have advanced our position with one of their products. So we've improved globally our overall positioning for access to lives, and that's played out in our HICS and exchange relationships as well. And then obviously with Medicare Advantage, we continue to build capabilities there to support the Medicare Advantage payers as appropriate. So those are two important points AJ, that I want to bring up in addition to what Mike said.
AJ Rice: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
Whit Mayo: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just was wondering if you guys have detected any changes with MA plan behavior or denials, any dispute resolution changes, and any changes on length of stay. Thanks.
Mike Marks: Hey, Whit. Let me first talk about the Medicare Advantage in context kind of the two midnight rule. And as we noted really on the fourth quarter call, we really did not see, you know, any additional movement from observation to inpatient status related to the adoption of the two midnight rule as we move through the first quarter of 2025. That was our expectation, and that's really what we saw. Medicare Advantage is now about 57% of our total Medicare admissions. You know, a couple of notes on the Medicare Advantage compared to traditional to your question. One would be that, you know, our Medicare Advantage observation mix is still about 15% higher than our traditional Medicare observation mix. And that's pretty steady at this point. And, yes, Medicare Advantage continues to run a bit hotter, a little higher on Wednesday than traditional Medicare as well. On dispute resolution, and I'll go broadly here and not just, you know, Medicare Advantage. But, you know, there continues to be activity, as you would expect in denials, and underpayments broadly with our payer partners. Our efforts that we have invested in over the last couple of years to strengthen our response to that are paying off. And I would tell you that that is in the first quarter that activities like denials underpayments did not have a material impact on our financials.
Whit Mayo: Okay. My second question is I know Mike you said you're not prepared to share any views on tariffs at this point, but is there any way to perhaps frame the percentage of supplies that you or HPG are sourcing from overseas? Just anything would be helpful. Thanks.
Mike Marks: Sure. You know, as Sam said at the beginning, we're in a really dynamic and fluid environment right now with tariffs. So, you know, until we really have better clarity about the final status by country, which goods are included or excluded, what the final tariff rates will be, you know, it's really difficult to size the impact on HCA. You know, as you know and as we talked about on previous calls, our HealthTrust organization has been working on this diligently, and I'm really proud of our HealthTrust team. And part of that work and I'll talk about 2025 and then give you a couple of other numbers for context. You know, for 2025, part of their work was the ability to secure significant fixed pricing. When you think about finished goods, so the purchases of supplies of finished goods, you know, about 70% of our supply expense is contracted with firm pricing for 2025. And just to give you a sense, that's upwards of 60% for some of all of 2026. Another point of context that I think is helpful, 75% of our supply expense comes from either the United States, Canada, or Mexico. Or from products that currently have broad exemption from tariffs, such as pharmaceuticals. As I've noted, HealthTrust continues to work on this. They're working on this to continue to secure fixed price contracting. They're continuing their work around supply chain mapping and risk assessments. And they are also deep in the middle of rationalizing suppliers' products as needed to deal with this tariff risk environment. Lastly, I would say that we're working hand in hand with our partners in our supply chain, our key suppliers, as they continue to work on derisking and diversifying their supply chain and specifically away from China. So I do believe that our tariff risk for 2025 is manageable. But I'll reiterate with Sam's opening comment that the environment is extremely fluid, and we are continuing to closely monitor as each day goes forward.
Whit Mayo: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Ben Hendrix: Hey. Thank you very much. I just have a broader labor-related question. We've heard from providers in the past that, you know, recessionary environments generally loosen the nursing labor market. Still seems like there's a lot of competition. Just based on your observations from the past, how reactive is the labor market to recession expectations? And is there any change to your wage inflation forecast in this current environment? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Well, our experiences are different through different recessions. I think, in general, your comment Ben, it's right, and that is that the labor market tends to ease somewhat during a recessionary cycle, and that can put some downward pressure on wages. Now we went through the most intense labor market environment from 2021, 2022, and early part of 2023. So our wage trends have come down from that quite significantly. Will it come down further? Possibly, but it's way too early to provide any kind of forecast with respect to what potential recession could do to the labor market. I think as we sit at this particular point in the year, we believe our guidance around our wages for 2025 will hold and be somewhere close to what we have indicated already.
Ben Hendrix: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Sarah James: You guys had strong growth in both inpatient and outpatient cardiac surgeries. How are you using your CapEx to support forward growth of that? Can you give us some insight into how you're thinking about providing your spend into high acuity versus low acuity or outpatient?
Sam Hazen: Well, this is Sam. You know, our capital allocation within our capital spending hasn't really changed, and I don't anticipate it's going to change materially as we push forward here. We have a very significant facility and ambulatory development strategy. Fortunately, the capital requirements for most of those facilities are small by comparison to what it takes to build out inpatient capacity. Today, we have about $6.2 billion of capital that has been approved and is in a and in 2025, 2026, or the first part of 2027. Those capital dollars go toward inpatient capacity. I think our inpatient capacity with respect to that pipeline is roughly 2.5% plus greater than what we have today. So a significant portion of that goes toward the inpatient capacity. We have outpatient capacity that includes outpatient facilities, emergency room capacity, cap lab capacity as you spoke to, ambulatory capacity, from a surgery standpoint, those are smaller dollars than the overall scheme of what it takes to build out those types of facilities. And then, obviously, we have a lot of clinical technology that we invest in so that our physicians and patients have the latest access to clinical technologies that can provide a more efficient or a better environment for patient care. I don't have the exact equipment spend within all of our totals there, but that is a component as well. So that's largely unchanged. It's growing because we are running the company at high levels of occupancy. We continue to have a nice pipeline of new projects that we think will make sense beyond the ones that we've approved, and it won't be any material change in sort of the allocation of the dollars within those categories.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe Sam will follow-up just to that comment that you made in a different light. So as we think about CapEx spend for the quarter, it was a little lower than typical range, like, 5.4% revenue. So just curious if there's anything there we need to be thinking about and maybe broader capital allocation, you know, good buyback during the quarter. How should we be thinking about the pace of repurchase for the year? Thanks.
Mike Marks: Hey, Brian. This is Mike. Let me cover the share repurchase first and we'll talk about CapEx a bit. So as you will note or you noted in our first quarter release, we completed $2.5 billion of share repurchased in the first quarter. We anticipate completing a significant portion of the $10 billion authorization in 2025, obviously, subject to market conditions and other factors. On CapEx, you're right. I mean, we spent $991 million in the quarter, which seemed a little light is to your question. We still believe we're on track of getting to our targeted level of capital spend and anticipate a bit of step up here as we go through the remaining part of the year. So we still think we're in this $5 billion maybe as high as $5.2 billion of CapEx spend in the year. As Sam indicated, you know, we continue to see a robust pipeline of really good projects from our markets. And so believe that that level of capital stands appropriate.
Brian Tanquilut: Awesome. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok with Barclays. Your line is open.
Andrew Mok: Hi. Good morning. Hoping you can clarify your hurricane commentary. I think, first, you noted that hurricane earnings were flat year over year in your impacted markets, but I'm not 100% I understand that because you have two markets that were hurricane impaired in Q1 this year. That were not impaired at this time last year. And if that's true, wouldn't that point to a year-over-year tailwind for the full year as those markets continue to improve against a more negative impact in the back half of last year? Thanks.
Mike Marks: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. This is how we think about it. And you'll recall when we did our 2025 guidance that our guidance assumed that the impacts of the hurricanes would offset each other. During the course of 2025 and would not produce a full-year tailwind for us. As it relates to the first quarter, this is largely what played out. If you take the earnings growth year over year, from our two main impacted markets in North Carolina division and West Florida are specifically the Largo Medical Center. Our earnings were flat year over year. In other words, the year-over-year earnings change was about negative, about neutral in those NOC markets. Year over year. And then I would just point you back to our original guidance for the year as it relates to the full-year impact of the hurricanes.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Matthew Gillmor: Hey. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the competitive environment in your markets. So with the ongoing policy and macro and uncertainty, do you see how system competitors behaving any differently in terms of their CapEx priorities or investments? Maybe that creates an opportunity for HCA. Or is the competitive dynamic not really impacted by the macro at this point?
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. I would say at this particular point in time, we haven't seen any substantial changes in competitors and how they interact in the markets. Now obviously, if NIH funding continues to be challenging for certain academic medical centers, that may influence their behaviors and spending. If there are other policy adjustments that take place, that could play out. We do think, you know, with our scale, with our diversification across the portfolio of markets, you know, that provides a different level of capability than a lot of our local competitors who tend to only be in one particular market. But, you know, our competitors in many instances have solid balance sheets, and we have to be able to anticipate their behaviors and their spending. And as I mentioned in my comments, we have in fact regained growing market share in a large portion of our market. So we're very encouraged by the progress we're making in light of the past spending and practices of our competitors. So if they're compromised in any fashion going forward, then maybe that presents an opportunity for us to pick up even more market share.
Matthew Gillmor: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to talk about the exchanges. First, can you give us the percentage of volumes and revenue in the quarter that came from the exchanges? I apologize if I missed them. And then bigger picture question just, you know, some of the academic work out there, guys, indicates that if the subsidies do go away, there's the real potential that a lot of these folks will go back to commercial-based insurance. I've seen numbers as high as, you know, almost half the people that lose coverage via the subsidies would go back to the commercial pool. Just curious if you have any view on that in terms of what could happen there. Thanks.
Mike Marks: Yeah. Good morning. This is Mike. Specifically on exchanges, let me give you a quick update here. I think you know this, but 2025 was another year of strong enrollment growth. In our states, the growth is about 12% over the prior year. We're up, you know, across the United States, down up to 24 million lives covered. For HCA in the quarter, the exchange volume represented about 8% of equivalent admissions and about 10% of our revenues. So that's the update for the quarter. You know, I think there's still a lot of unknowns here about what could happen. If the EPTC, the enhanced premium tax credits do sunset and it's for are not extending their current form or to some revised form. So we're gonna have to wait and see exactly how that plays out, and we're really not in a position to comment on related to, you know, how many go back to employee-sponsored insurance. Although, you know, I think we generally agree that there will be some that would go back to employee-sponsored insurance. I think there'll be some that would stay on the exchanges and maybe drop metal tier, and then others that get these enhanced premium tax credits do sunset that would lose coverage and become uninsured. So, you know, we're not in a position yet until we have a little more clarity around what's gonna happen in the legislative environment, Justin, to specifically size it or comment on others' research in this space.
Justin Lake: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joanna Gajuk with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Joanna Gajuk: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. I guess, maybe first on just clarifying the comment around your DPP benefits. You said it increased year over year by $80 million. Can you confirm whether there was anything unusual under? Is it as it's expected, you know, what you had expected in the quarter? And do you still expect the full year, if it used to be flat to down? $150 million.
Mike Marks: Hey, Joanna. This is Mike. So, yes, during the quarter, we recognized approximately $80 million increase in our net benefit year over year. The largest driver of this is really the increase in one state where we received a record payment and began accruing for that program in Q4 of last year. So that was what drove it. You know, as we've talked about on past calls, the projecting or the guidance related to state supplemental payment programs are really the most difficult thing that we predict. And so we keep those updated for you when we meet quarterly, obviously, of the calls. I would say now, based on what we know now after our first quarter activity, that we would be thinking about for a full year 2025 versus 2024 or something like $50 million better to a $200 million decline now. So that would be the general update that we would give you on range. As it relates to just kind of a general update on state supplemental payment programs, you know, we continue to generally get a flow of funds on our legacy programs. I would say that we were encouraged over the last couple of weeks that we have seen a couple of approvals by CMS, one in Arizona and one in Nevada, that were hopeful. And so, you know, largely that would be kind of where we are right now on state supplemental payment purposes.
Joanna Gajuk: I'm sorry. So you said that Arizona and Nevada approved. So is that the reason why you're thinking DPP payment for the year higher? There was just something that happened in Q1 that this $80 million that makes you feel better about the year?
Mike Marks: Yeah. I think the Q1 outcome was a bit better than we expected. You know, our expectation was really that the first half of the year be flat. With, you know, potential declines primarily coming in the back half of the year. So, you know, based on this first quarter net benefit, we're comfortable now kind of sizing or estimating that supplemental payments would be something like $50 million for the full year to a $200 million decline. You know, really, that range is largely associated with Tennessee, Joanna. And we first of all, let me just say we did not record anything related to Tennessee in the quarter. And that we have not received approval for Tennessee at this point.
Joanna Gajuk: Because that was my question. So just to clarify, you still assume Tennessee benefits in that full-year number. Correct?
Mike Marks: So let's say the quarter first, we recorded nothing in HSA in the quarter in the first quarter. So the back half of 2024 interim payment was not received. We did not record it. And we have not received approval for the 2025 calendar year program from CMS. The guidance, if you think about this range of guidance from a $50 million improvement to the prior year for the full year to a $200 million decline. Largely, that range is associated with whether or not Tennessee gets approved. And so that's how I would context that for you, Joanna.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Ryan Langston: Hi. Thanks. I'm wondering just how the surgical schedules and block time utilization kind of looking and progressing. I'm not trying to get quarterly guidance, but just wondering if we can glean anything, you know, just given potential for tariffs, recession, and just, you know, consumer confidence declining. Wondering if there's, you know, having any impact on the elective procedural side and patient behavior. Thank you.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. I don't have that information in front of us as far as, you know, forward scheduling. We have systems within each of our facilities where that information is available. We don't roll that up at the corporate level. So I'm not able to give you that answer at this point. I think, again, in general, we think demand for healthcare is going to be there. Our inpatient surgeries were up on a per business day. So as we normalize calendar effects, and we have, you know, sort of comparable calendar dynamics. We expect our surgical volumes to recover to, you know, levels that we think are in line with market share trends or market share gains that we have expected. So that's how we're thinking about it. And we continue to build our medical staff, which are critically important. As I mentioned, we're adding facilities where we need to, adding technology. We've got a robust workforce development agenda to support our surgical services. And we continue to make inroads into better operations, which are beneficial to our physicians and surgeons and beneficial to our patients. So all that sort of converging on our viewpoints that surgical demand is reasonable and we can execute underneath that.
Ryan Langston: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Joshua Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I was looking if you could speak to your technology agenda, maybe specifically some investments that you think differentiate HCA on the clinical care side, and I'm gonna assume that AI is a part of that conversation.
Sam Hazen: We are investing heavily in our tech agenda. One of the key initiatives that we have within our strategic plan is advancing technology and applying it broadly to the organization. We set up a new function department in our company called the Digital Transformation and Innovation Group, and they are leading the charge for us as we push forward on this particular initiative. We have three areas that we think we can benefit our business using better digital tools, using automation, and using AI. The first categories are administrative functioning. When you think about our parallel on services, our supply chain services, human resource functioning, and so forth. We have early tools that are being developed and implemented in those areas, which are incrementally adding value. The second category for us is operational. And by that, I mean, what goes on in our facilities, primarily our hospitals, where we can improve staffing and scheduling and create better tools for our management teams, better tools and insights for our employees, as they schedule to meet their needs. Another area in our operational categories is with case management functions as it relates to length of stay management, as it relates to prior authorizations, all of these things that go into the operations at a facility level, we are deploying tools in those areas. And then the holy grail for us is clinical, as you mentioned. We do have some opportunities there. We're slowly moving into that space where we can use, again, some digital tools. We can use our data to source best practices, and we're working to create value for our physicians and our caregivers in a way that they have the advantages that come from those insights. We're early in that space because it's very important that we be accurate. It's very important that we be compliant and that the tools that we provide truly add value. And we've got some areas in Obstetrics, where we're working with one of our partners, where we think we can improve the labor and delivery process with these tools, and we've got early signs of success there. But it's really early in that particular category. So I'm encouraged about where we are. We continue to find ways to advance the use of digital tools and technology across the different spectrum of our business, and that I believe is going to be something that we build upon in the years to come.
Joshua Raskin: Great. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Stephen Baxter: Hi. Thanks. Just another question. You know, kind of the managed care mix. The 5.4% you gave on the managed care volumes. Just to make sure that that's inclusive of the exchanges or excluding it? And if it's included, it needs to be able to give us a standalone, you know, managed care ex exchange server. The quarter? Thank you.
Mike Marks: Yes. Hey. This is Mike. So the 5.4% is equivalent addition, same facility growth in total managed care does include exchanges. If you would parse those apart, the exchanges were up 22% and the, kind of core, you know, and a big thing of it is employee-sponsored insurance, you know, was up about let's just call it just short of half a point over property.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. Your line is open.
John Ransom: Hey. Good morning. I'm gonna be the slow child in class, so forgive me. But if we're just to look at Asheville and Largo, is your new guidance assume that the EBITDA is now flat in 2025 versus 2024?
Mike Marks: So the guidance if you think about the full-year guidance, we gave on our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call, what we indicated is that we thought with the lingering effects of the hurricane, that the year-over-year earnings impact of the hurricane effect markets would kind of be flat, would be neutral, and would not produce a tailwind for the company. As what is our report out here in our first quarter call is that's largely what played out. So if you think about the year-over-year earnings change, in West Florida, in the Largo area, compared to the year-over-year earnings change in North Carolina this year. Flat we're flat. You know, we're able to offset each other to a large degree. And that's our update for the first quarter.
John Ransom: Oh, okay. I see. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Lance Wilkes: Great. Thanks. Can you talk a little bit about how you're seeing the downstream impacts from the pressure on the managed care organizations both in the quarter and the outlook, going forward for the year? And what I'm thinking about is increased use or not increased use of value-based care. Are you seeing any of the changes in deductibles or out of pocket for consumers and some of the products having impacts on bad debt or utilization? And then just a point of clarification, what do you see as far as flu impacts both to the positive and negative in the quarter? Thanks.
Mike Marks: So let me cover respiratory first, and then we'll get to your payer questions. On respiratory volumes, you know, I'll refer you back to the fourth quarter where, you know, clearly in the fourth quarter of 2024, our respiratory-related volumes were behind the prior year, and we indicated that the respiratory season had a bit of a late start. In compared to the previous year. So what we saw in the first quarter of 2025 was, you know, they were pretty significantly up over the fourth quarter of 2024. But when I look at the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024, our respiratory volumes in total were pretty much in line. They were just a tick to the prior year, our first quarter of 2024, pretty much in line with prior year levels. And, you know, you may recall, but if you go back to that prior year flu season, it started early. So it started kind of beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023 and it persisted. Pretty much through the end of the first quarter of 2024. So that's the year-over-year comp on the respiratory season. When I think about the impact on, you know, patient receivables, you know, and you'll remember from past conversations on this over the years, but we monitor this closely and what we're looking at is kind of what happens over time to the patient portion or the patient balance. As, you know, the employer benefit plan changes or design changes are made every year. Historically, for our commercial payers, we experienced increases in average patient balances in the mid-single-digit range on an annual basis. In our recent quarters, we have seen increases a little higher than that but not material. The increases certainly have been influenced by growth in health and exchange volumes, which tend to have a slightly higher patient responsibility compared to traditional commercial. On collectability, we generally maintain our historical level of collections, no patient balances, across either kind of our population as it relates to the exchanges, the rate of collections on patient balances is a bit more than the traditional employee-sponsored insurance population. But while lower, the exchanges have not had a material impact on the collectability of our patient receivables in the aggregate. So that's a bit of an update there on patient receipt.
Sam Hazen: But I think it's safe to say, Mike, that value-based care co-pays and deductibles aren't in any fashion disrupting the demand curve. And that's sort of our over our demand trends suggest. We don't see those items influencing in any material way our thinking around overall demand.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Ben Rossi with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Ben Rossi: Hey. Good morning. So for the executive order from the other week, there was a call out on acquisition costs for covered outpatient drugs at HOPBs. It sounds like this would be more geared towards drug administration, and appreciate the uncertainty here with the broader discussion on Medicare site neutral. Your opening comments. But just curious how you're thinking about the initial impact here. Would this encompass more of a lower acuity set of procedures relative to your broader set of outpatient services?
Mike Marks: Yeah. So, you know, we're certainly aware of the executive order from the administration on what potentially are directing agencies to lower drug prices. We're gonna have to see, you know, the draft rules that come out of this as we believe they'll be part of a public comment and notice period. And we're gonna need that additional specificity to be able to kind of comment on what potential impact it could have on HCA.
Ben Rossi: Got it. Completely understand. Thanks.
Operator: And your final question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Craig Hettenbach: Great. Thank you. Just Sam, going back to the demand backdrop, can you just talk about the durability of demand in particular in light of the equivalent emissions growth target of 3 to 4% this year, kind of how you see that playing out?
Sam Hazen: Well, as I've just mentioned, I don't think we are seeing anything currently that suggests that the demand assumptions that we have are wrong. We looked at the first quarter. If you take the leap year effect in, our adjusted admissions were almost 3.8% up. So that's a really good metric for us. And we're encouraged by that year-over-year growth as we mentioned. So from a competitive standpoint, we don't feel like there's anything happening that's compromising our ability to gain share from sort of a model standpoint. I just mentioned that value-based care and other efforts aren't necessarily negatively influencing demand. And so as we push through the rest of this year, we continue to believe that our range of assumptions around volumes hold and should materialize unless something dramatic happens. And at this point, we don't know what that would be.
Craig Hettenbach: Understood. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Frank Morgan for closing remarks.
Frank Morgan: Andy, thank you for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Hope you have a good weekend. I'm around this afternoon if you have any additional questions, to answer any additional questions you might have. Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Janine, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the HCA Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All lines have been muted to prevent any background noise. After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Frank Morgan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Frank Morgan: Good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen and CFO, Mike Marks. Sam and Mike will provide some prepared remarks and then we'll take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: All right. Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everybody. The company finished the year with strong business fundamentals that were consistent with the previous quarters this year. Demand for health care services remains strong, operations were in good order and stable, and the company continued to see favorable investment opportunities. These fundamentals represent a good starting point as we enter 2025. Our teams have done a fantastic job in remediating a number of facilities in North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida that were impacted by the two major hurricanes we experienced a few months ago. All of these facilities including Mission Hospital in Nashville, where the community's recovery efforts continue, and Largo Hospital in our West Florida division resumed normal operations in the quarter. As we end 2024, the first half of this decade has been another period of long-term growth for the company. We have seen operational improvements across key performance indicators, and we have delivered increased value for our shareholders. These accomplishments position us well for the future. I'm grateful to our colleagues who made this happen. We believe the HCA way of combining our high-quality local health networks with the capability of a national system consistently produces better patient outcomes, drives greater innovation and efficiency and yields stronger financial results. While gratified with these accomplishments, we will maintain our pursuit to improve outcomes further for our stakeholders. We believe the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet position, position us well for investing further in our networks to increase access, expand capacity and enhance clinical capabilities. They also allow significant investments in our people to improve training while also creating career growth in our company. And finally, this financial strength creates opportunities to deliver value to our shareholders by effectively allocating capital to generate favorable returns. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, increased 5.4% in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year. These results included the effects of two major hurricanes. In the quarter, we estimate the financial impact from increased costs and lost revenue equated to approximately $0.60 per share. This was in line with the estimation we provided on our previous earnings call. Revenue growth was approximately 6%. Demand, payer mix and acuity continued to be strong across most service categories and markets. On a same-facilities basis, inpatient admissions and equivalent admissions grew 3%. Emergency room visits increased 2.4%. Inpatient surgeries were up 2.8%. Outpatient surgery cases, while down 1.3%, again, due to the strong payer mix and service mix, we had solid revenue growth in this service line. And lastly, rehab, obstetrics, and cardiac procedure volumes continued to be strong. Operating costs were well managed by our teams and remained in line with our expectations. Before I close, you will see that our earnings guidance for 2025 aligns with the preliminary outlook we provided on our prior call. And with that, I'll turn the call to Mike for details.
Mike Marks: Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide additional comments on the quarter and year and then discuss our 2025 guidance. Regarding the fourth quarter, we are pleased with the results of the quarter, which demonstrates the excellence of our teams and responding to challenges and still producing solid results. As Sam noted, we estimate that the adverse hurricane impact in fourth quarter 2024 was approximately $200 million or $0.60 per diluted share, in line with our expectations. These estimates do not include any insurance recoveries the company may receive in the future. Considering the hurricane impact, we had good top line growth. Sam reviewed the volume information for quarter. Our volume in the quarter was adversely impacted by both the hurricane impact and a depressed respiratory season compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Same-facility net revenue per equivalent admissions increased 2.9% over prior year, in line with our expectations. Consistent with our trends all year, payer mix remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2024, with same-facility managed care admissions, up 9.2% compared to the prior year quarter. While our operations performed well in the quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin declined 60 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. This decline is primarily related to the impact of the hurricanes on our Largo Hospital in Tampa and the North Carolina division, which had a 100 basis point unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter. Additional expenses related to these hurricanes, including repair costs for our Largo Hospital, drove the increase in other operating expenses as a percent of revenue and half of the supply increase. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter grew 2.6% compared to the prior year quarter, which reflects the impact of the hurricanes. Diluted earnings per share as adjusted in the fourth quarter grew 5.4% over the prior year quarter, also reflecting the impact of hurricanes. Let me briefly highlight our full year results for 2024. We had strong pipeline growth of 8.7%, with revenue per equivalent admission of 3.2% and equivalent admissions growing 4.5%. We posted a 10 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin for the year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% over prior year, and diluted earnings per share increased 15.5% over the prior year. We estimate that lost revenue and additional expenses from the hurricanes adversely impacted full year 2024 by $250 million or $0.73 per diluted share. Our full year incremental net benefit from supplemental payment programs was approximately $400 million, with fourth quarter being the lowest incremental net benefit of the year. This is an increase from the $100 million to $200 million incremental net benefit we expected, largely due to one-time payments and higher-than-expected program payments in a few states. When we consider the $250 million unfavorable hurricane impact, the prior year $145 million payer settlement, and the incremental net Medicaid supplemental program benefit in the year, we are very pleased with the core operating performance of the company in 2024. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to deploy a balanced strategy of allocating capital for long-term value creation. Cash flow from operations was $2.6 billion in the quarter and $10.5 billion for the year. This represents an 11% increase in operating cash flow in 2024 over prior year, indicative of great work by our operating and administrative teams. Capital expenditures totaled $1.29 billion in the quarter and $4.9 billion in the year and we paid $1.7 billion for repurchases of our outstanding shares during the quarter and $6 billion in the year. We paid $165 million in dividends for the quarter and $690 million for the year. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage remains at the low end of our stated guidance range, and we believe we are well-positioned from a balance sheet perspective. As a result, we are lowering our targeted leverage ratio from our current 3 times to 4 times to 2.75 times to 3.75 times. We believe this new range fits our profile and our anticipated use of leverage as a company, assuming no significant transactions or extraordinary events. So, with that, let me speak to our 2025 guidance for a moment. As noted in our guidance this morning, we are providing full year 2025 guidance as follows; we expect revenues to range between $72.8 billion and $75.8 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $5.85 billion and $6.29 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $14.3 billion and $15.1 billion. We expect diluted earnings per share to range between $24.05 and $25.85. We expect capital spending to be approximately $5 billion to $5.2 billion. Our guidance assumes a growth in equivalent admissions between 3% and 4% and net revenue per equivalent admission between 2% and 3%. Regarding the effects of the 2024 hurricanes on our earnings guidance for 2025, we expect a year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA from the reopening of Largo and a year-over-year decline in the North Carolina division as our current assumptions in this market will have lingering effects of Hurricane Helene throughout much of 2025. The increase at Largo and the decline in North Carolina are expected to are expected to offset and not produce a tailwind for us in 2025. Regarding Medicaid supplemental payment programs. As we've said in these past, these programs are complex, variable in timing and do not fully cover our cost to treat Medicaid patients. Based on current assumptions, when we aggregate the impact of all of our supplemental payment programs, our guidance contemplate the net effect of Medicaid supplemental payment programs to range from being flat to 2024 to a $250 million headwind, driven by one-time payments received in a few states in 2024. The new Tennessee program is considered in this range. We expect full year margins to be consistent with 2024 and cash flow from operations to range from $10.75 billion to $11.25 billion. As noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $10 billion share repurchase program, and we anticipate completing a significant portion in 2025, subject to market conditions and other factors. In addition, our Board declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.66 to $0.72 per share. And with that, I will turn the call over to Frank for questions.
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Mike. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question, so that we may have as many as possible in the queue an opportunity to ask a question. Janine, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Pito Chickering : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess this question will be on Medicaid supplemental, and I just want to understand a little bit on where we were in -- for 2024, it has been bouncing around a little bit. From third quarter to sort of fourth quarter, did that number change? Was that $400 million that you came in on the year? I guess, you sort of bridge where were on the last time you guided us into where it is now. And then for 2005 [ph], can you just sort of make sure that we bridge sort of where we are in 2004 [ph], 2005 [ph] on what's in the low end and high end of guidance for Medicaid payments? Thank you.
Mike Marks: Pito, this is Mike. Yes. So if you think about the net incremental benefit from our supplemental payment programs for the full year 2024, it's about $400 million. As I noted in my comments, fourth quarter was the lowest incremental net benefit of the four quarters in the year. You may recall from our second quarter that the second quarter of 2024 was the highest benefit at $125 million. And so that's kind of how it's spread out. The driver was really largely related to one-time payments that came in, in a few states and a couple of our state programs that came in a little more favorably than we expected. So that's where we landed. And then as you start thinking about 2025, as I noted in my guidance, when we consider all the various programs, noting the complexity and the variability and the moving parts, we are projecting and estimating that our net effect of supplemental payment programs will range between flat to 2024 to upwards of a $250 million headwind. That is inclusive of a pretty wide range of estimation related to the new Tennessee program. So that's how it kind of went through the year and that's the basis of our projections for 2025.
Pito Chickering: So Mike, actually, just all, I guess, for 2024, are you saying it's $400 million? The highest in 2Q is $125 million and lowest in 4Q. I guess, can you just actually give us just a quarterly benefit because $400 million with 2Q $125 million, that seems it's not that high versus the rest of the quarter. So any color on sort of how that flows through the whole year? Thank you.
Mike Marks: Well, I mean, I think you can take Q2, Pito, at $125 million as the high watermark. And then obviously, first and third quarter would be a little bit higher and fourth quarter will be the lowest. I mean, that's the best I can give you in terms of the flow through the year.
Pito Chickering: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. It sounds like the MA or Managed Care, rather, same-store admissions were strong. I wonder because there was so much publicity in the quarter around MCOs. Did you -- where are you at in your pricing for 2025, 2026? Anything new or different you're seeing in terms of utilization review, denial rates, anything along those lines?
Mike Marks: So, hi, A.J., this is Mike. In terms of our contracting, we are 80% contracted for 2025, 60% contracted for 2026, and I think it's 20% contracted for 2027. We're still in -- on top of our range estimates, our targets in terms of pricing. As I think about denials and underpayments, clearly a lot of activity, but we put a lot of effort over the last couple of two or three years in really beefing up our capabilities, managing through the denial and underpayment process. I would say, when we think about not only fourth quarter but the full year of 2024, we are not seeing growth in denials being a material impact for the company at this point.
A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Whit Mayo: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to hear maybe some of the internal initiatives that may be moving to the forefront this year. I feel like you guys have been talking a lot about throughput, ER optimization for a while, case mix, length of stay, all that. Anything on the back end with discharge management? Anything around length of stay and bottlenecks that you might be seeing around post-acute? Thanks.
Mike Marks: So yeah, case management, inpatient throughput has been a really strong initiative for us over the last couple of years with. We even mentioned it in the Investor Day conference last year. And our work continues and continues to strengthen. Specifically, when I think about the going forward into 2025, we have a number of initiatives within our case management infrastructure focused on improving the post-acute care placement and discharge process. And I might say even especially with our Medicare Advantage payers. And that work continues and it's important. But if I kind of take stock of where we are today, our length of stay performance in the year has been solid, and we're forecasting another good year for length of stay management as we head into 2025.
Sam Hazen: Yes, and let me add to that, Mike. So I mean, we have a number of initiatives that are progressing across the company. And when you think about our network development initiatives, we continue to add facilities. You'll see that we've got more facilities at the end of this year than we did last year. So our capital as well as some incremental acquisitions and some key markets is allowing us to expand the reach of our networks. That's showcasing itself in growing market share. What we're seeing in our market share data is really encouraging and lends itself to continued opportunities in that particular initiative. In addition to the case management operational initiative that Mike was talking about, we've had tremendous success with our emergency room, operational improvement plan as well. And that's yielded throughput improvements, patient satisfaction improvements and growth, allowing us again to extend the reach of that channel and meet the needs of the community in an effective way. And again, as we push into 2025, we'll see more emergency room bed supply inside of our networks as a result of the investments that we're making, and then the ability to use those beds productively with our ER revitalization program. We're carrying the elements of success from that program to our operating rooms. We have an operating room optimization initiative that we think is going to be very beneficial to our surgeons and also our patients. And it mirrors a lot of the efforts and the progress we've seen with our emergency room. And this involves turnaround time, staffing, other elements of OR efficiency that's important to our physician partners as well as our patients. And then finally, I will say that our labor agenda continues to improve. This past year, I'm really proud of our accomplishments as a company. Our employee engagement broadly across all colleagues and especially inside of nursing is at an all-time high for the company. That has allowed us to reduce turnover and really improve the capabilities of our facilities with having continuity and staffing, a more competent workforce and the necessary capacity to really meet the demand. So we have a number of what I call winning plays that are beneficial to the organization, responsive to the communities and really position our company for success. As we push forward, we've talked about our longer term initiatives. Our longer term initiatives are geared toward technology and using technology. We're on journey. We're already seeing early signs of success with how AI can improve aspects of our organization, administratively, operationally inside of our facilities, and we think clinically as well. So that's a very exciting agenda. And I know others speak of AI but within the processes that exists for us as a health care provider, we see a lot of potential to drive better quality, greater efficiencies, and even better management of our business. And so those things continue. I think our capital allocation is another important initiative for the company. We're investing heavily back in the business. We'll invest somewhere between $5 billion and $5.2 billion this year. And then we've got the ability to use the cash flow and our balance sheet to deliver even more value through shareholder programs that Mike alluded to earlier. So all of these combined, we believe, to create value, value for our patients, value for our employees, and value for our shareholders.
Whit Mayo: Thank you
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ben Hendrix: Great. Thank you very much. After another strong year of state exchange enrollment growth, just wanted to get your thoughts on how you see commercial mix progressing and how enrollment fared for you guys. In your opinion, how it's going to impact Florida and Texas? And then any thoughts broadly on the fate of the enhanced subsidies under the new administration and any efforts you've made with lobbyists or whatever in that regard? Thank you.
Sam Hazen: All right. Thanks, Ben. Clearly, the enrollments inside the exchanges continue to strengthen. We think it's somewhere around 25 million at this particular juncture, so it's up 12% to 15%, I think, over 2024. And we're seeing consistent growth across a number of HCA states. So that's a positive, we believe. It's a positive outcome for families. It creates greater access to care. It improves outcomes. So all of that as a backdrop, we think politically, is a positive and presents an opportunity for the Trump administration, we believe, to sustain and ensure that families have coverage, they have affordability, and they have the opportunity to achieve positive outcomes for their -- for themselves and really for their family. So we don't have any current insights into where this is going. All we know at this particular juncture is that they are due to expire at the end of next year. We think the backdrop of growth, the backdrop of satisfaction within the enrollment is a positive. And we see opportunities to work with the Trump administration to find a pathway forward to continue what's been a very positive community benefit, we believe, with the exchanges. We have a very robust agenda to partner with other organizations, to work within our coalition to support advocacy here to achieve the outcome that we think makes sense for the different communities that we serve. So it's too early for us to call anything on that, but we are active in the process as you would expect.
Mike Marks: And Ben, in terms of your question about payer mix and where it landed, healthcare exchanges now represents 7.5% of our equivalent admissions in 2024 and about 9% of our revenues.
Ben Hendrix: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Ann Hynes: Great. Thank you. I just want to ask about the Medicare Two-Midnight Rule. How much impact do you think that had on inpatient admissions in 2024? And do you think it will continue to be a benefit? I think in the last earnings call, you gave a stat that detailed the difference between Medicare Advantage observation versus traditional Medicare fee for service. Can you remind us of what that stat is? And do you think over time, you can close that gap? That would be great. Thank you.
Mike Marks: Yes. Hey, this is Mike. So in terms of the impact, if I look at kind of the movement from observation to inpatient status, consistent with the Medicare Advantage Two-Midnight Rule, for full year 2024, we estimate that it was equivalent to approximately 50 basis points of our overall admission growth. I would say that, that's remained pretty consistent over the four quarters. So, I don't think that it's going to be -- you'll see much more movement as you go into 2025. As to the comparison of Medicare Advantage observation mix to traditional, I would note that the Medicare Advantage observation as a percentage of total to opt-in is approximately 20% higher than traditional Medicare. But I don't suspect at this right that we're going to see material changes. At this point, we're really focused on collecting on that revenue and working through the denial and appeal processes associated with the Medicare Advantage program. I don't think you'll see a material change in kind of the volume trends that we've seen so far this year as we head to 2025.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Andrew Mok: Hi, good morning. Hoping you could spike out the performance of Mission Hospital in the quarter and help us understand what impacts that had on same-store volumes in the quarter and the pace of recovery throughout 2025, including any explicit EBITDA functions around hurricane in the guidance? Thanks.
Mike Marks: Let me just talk about volumes overall, Andrew, as we think about fourth quarter. With 3% same-facility admission and equivalent admission growth to prior year in the quarter, first thing I might mention is it was a little bit of a tougher comparison to fourth quarter of 2023, which had strong growth. We did experience, I mentioned this overall, and again I'm speaking overall, not just related to North Carolina division, but overall, we did experience a depressed respiratory season in fourth quarter of 2024 compared to fourth quarter of 2023. Our estimate is that this depressed respiratory season had about a 1-point drag on same-facility admission growth to prior year and about a 2-point drag on same-facility emergency room visits growth to prior year. Overall, as a company, the hurricanes as well had an impact on volume growth primarily in October, but for the whole quarter. Our estimates are somewhere between 20 and 40 basis points of drag on volume in the quarter related to hurricanes and that's directly attributable. I'd also mentioned that in the month of October, if you look at the rest of the State of Florida, there was clearly some lingering effects as they kind of recovered. And then we saw a good recovery in November and December. So, that's kind of a tale of the tape on volume in the quarter.
Andrew Mok: And was there any explicit EBITDA assumption for hurricanes in the guidance?
Mike Marks: Yes. So, if you go back to my comments, Andrew, the way that we are guiding for hurricane impact into 2025 is this, that if you think about -- let's start with Largo, if you think about Largo Hospital, we do expect a year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA from the reopening of Largo and a year-over-year decline in the North Carolina division as our current assumption is this market will have lingering effects of the hurricane throughout much of 2025. The guidance really contemplates that the increase at Largo and the decline in North Carolina are expected to offset and are not expected to produce a tailwind for us in 2025. So that's the way to think about the hurricanes and their impact into 2025.
Andrew Mok: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanna Gajuk from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joanna Gajuk: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. So I guess on the somewhat related question, I guess, on the cost side of things, so thanks for the color on the impact from the hurricane in the quarter in Q4 to the other OpEx line. So I want to ask about professional fees. You've been talking about this for quite some time, but most recently, you highlighted the higher-than-expected professional fees to continue into 2025. So can you talk about what you're seeing there? What do you assume in your guidance? We heard maybe radiologists or the next group of doctors that are asking for higher fees. So is that what you're seeing? And also, can you help us maybe also size that line in your other OpEx line? Thank you.
Mike Marks : So professional fees are about 24% of other operating expenses so that's how you would size it. As we've mentioned in the last several calls, our operating teams have continued to work diligently to address the subsidy pressure from the hospital-based physician group component of our business. And as we've noted, as we've gone through the year, we have bent the cost curve. On professional fees, as we've moved through 2024, really due to these efforts. So as I think about the guidance into 2025, I would say it like this. We expect the cost pressures related to physician costs to moderate a bit further in 2025. But it's still going to be higher than just normal inflationary cost trends. And that's how you would think about that flow into the next year. Maybe a double-click on radiology. When you're looking at our hospital-based physician categories, clearly, the emergency room and the hospital medicine segments have moved more fully through the business challenges that we see in this segment, really especially given the significant work HCA has done with the acquisition and integration of Valesco. As it relates to radiology, we did see pressure as we've gone through 2024, and we expect that to continue into 2025. But keep in mind that radiology is a much lower portion of our hospital-based physician subsidies. I'll just finish with this, is that our teams have focused efforts between both our operating teams and our physician management teams focused on addressing radiology, and we do not expect it to be a material impact in 2025.
Joanna Gajuk: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Matthew Gillmor: Hi. Thanks for the question. I want to see if there's any commentary on the California wildfires. And I know you've got a couple of facilities in the L.A. area, but any impact there to call out or is it just not big enough at the consolidated level to make a real difference?
Sam Hazen : This is Sam. We had no impact at our Southern California hospitals as a result of the fires. We did have one of our facilities in Ventura County on notice, so to speak, in the sense that there was the Kenneth Fire, I think it was, that was in Ventura County. The Palisades Fire did not reach through the valley into Ventura County. But we're on high alert, and we have fire mitigation tactics in that particular hospital due to its location and so forth. And we continue to evolve that just like we do with hurricanes and making sure that we can protect our patients and protect our colleagues and protect the asset. And we're iterating, if you will, on our plan there to advance it even further. In Riverside, California, there's been some fires in the proximity that have produced some smoke issues in the community, but no issue whatsoever on our facility there. So we're fortunate. That's a horrible event, as everybody knows, but we were on the other side of the canyon with our facility in Thousand Oaks.
Matthew Gillmor: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Meghan Holtz: Good morning, everyone. This is Meghan Holtz on for Brian. As we think about Q1 EBITDA, are there any moving pieces, including some seasonality or non-recurring items that we should be considering? And then just a quick clarifying question on the supplemental payments. You referred to the new Tennessee program. Does that mean it was approved recently?
Mike Marks: Let me handle the second one first. So in the Tennessee program, we have been notified of approval of a partial year. And so we have -- we see an approval that would, in effect, cover July 1 of 2024 through December 31 of 2024. And then they are transitioning that to a calendar year program beginning in 2025. The 2025 calendar year program, which is new, has not been approved. And so the new administration will be addressing that. So that's the status of the new Tennessee program. We don't give quarter-by-quarter guidance so our normal advice is just to follow our historical seasonal trends, and we would stick with that. So the 2025 guidance is for the full year of 2025.
Meghan Holtz: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks. It's Anna on for Justin. Have you guys attempted to size the potential impact of site neutral payments? And if so, does that sort of alter your strategy at all surrounding your outpatient ASC footprint? And can you tell us where also the same-store ASC revenue growth was in the quarter? Thanks.
Mike Marks: So, on site neutral, let's start with just stating the obvious. We're against program implementations that would cut Medicare hospital outpatient reimbursement, nor do we think that programmatically that it makes sense to pay the same rate for a hospital. And I'll use surgery, but you could use all of our service that operates on a 24/7 basis with full capabilities of physicians, of staff and equipment. If you'll compare that, for example, to our surgery centers, who generally operate eight to four Monday through Friday and do much less complex work, the idea of paying the same rate for those does not seem to make a lot of sense to us. As it relates to sizing the potential impact, we have not seen a bill yet that would give us enough information to estimate a potential impact. In the past, as you've seen various proposals and discussions around this, there's been a range of procedures being considered for Medicare site neutral. On one end of the range would be proposals around hospital based physician clinic visits and outpatient infusion facilities. At that end of the range, HCA would not be materially impacted, given how we structure our physician clinics. In other draft proposals, we've seen certain outpatient surgical procedures being considered for cuts to hospital outpatient reimbursement. We would expect that those would have a bit more notable impact to HCA. But like a lot of these health care policy debates that are going through the government right now, we continue to monitor them closely, as I'm sure you do, and we'll be tracking.
Sam Hazen: And Mike, I don't see that any site neutral policy per se will force us or cause us to rethink our strategy around building out our outpatient networks. We believe, we are finding opportunities to extend the reach of our networks into new communities, again, make it more convenient and more efficient for the patient, and then fully integrate that particular facility into the larger hospital-centric health system is part and parcel to our network development strategy. So I don't see any changes to that as a result of a Medicare site neutral provision if one were to be implemented.
Mike Marks: And to your question around the growth in ASC revenues, it's about right at 5% to 6% growth over prior year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to stick on the policy side. And was curious just, and understanding it's clearly still very early, but if you've done any type of preliminary analysis around Trump's tariff proposals and if you think there could be any net effect or economic impact from that. And then also from some of the recent executive orders that he's already been tossing out at a brisk rate as it relates to foreign workers and immigrants, et cetera. Just curious if you think any of those may have an effect on either the labor or demand environment. Thanks a lot.
Mike Marks: On tariffs, our HealthTrust great purchasing organization has been working on tariff mitigation strategies for many years; including actions like fixed price contracting, supply chain mapping and risk assessments and a lot of work on sourcing. Many of our team suppliers have been working on derisking and diversifying their supply chains over the last many years, really kind of especially away from China. Like you, we are closely monitoring the announcements on tariffs from the new administration, including, which countries are targeted, the rate of tariffs being implemented, and potential tariff exclusions for health care-related items. I would note that for 2025, we have about 70% of our supplies being contracted with firm pricing. As it relates to sizing it, we need more specific information on the details of these tariff policies as noted, and we're going to need that before we can produce additional estimates of impact. On the other related items, we're tracking those carefully as all of you are. We don't hire undocumented workers. And so the impact would be more on supply demand for labor in those skill mixes and we're tracking it like you are, but no special insight or note that we can give you at this point.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. I just want to clarify again the bridge on equivalent admissions going from the 4.5% to the 3% to 4%. So it sounds like you're implying Mission and Largo offset each other explicitly on EBITDA but sort of implied on volumes. And then we're calculating 27 bps from a non-repeated leap year. And I'm not sure, if you're assuming any pull forward of procedures from consumers that may be concerned about expanded subsidies going away. So I'd love to know that. And then just the rest of it, is that just conservatism going back to the mean? Or is there anything specific exiting 4Q that you saw that led you to be conservative?
Mike Marks: So when I think about our 2025 guidance on volume, and so we're projecting a 3% to 4% growth in equivalent admissions for 2025. And as you noted, we ran higher than that through September year-to-date, call it, 5% growth. And then fourth quarter was a little bit more in line with that at a 3% growth. Although, as I noted on an earlier question, we did see in fourth quarter a bit of impact with depressed flu season -- sorry, respiratory season, and a little bit of drag in fourth quarter related to hurricanes. As I bridge our volume into 2025, I mean, I might note a couple of things. One would be -- and probably the big one is just the healthcare exchanges. We had big enrollment growth in 2024, call it, 30%. And we had big volume growth in 2024, 44%, 45% growth in exchange volume in 2024. As we look at enrollment into 2025 on the healthcare exchanges, we're seeing, call it, 13%, 14%, 15% growth in enrollment in our states for 2025. And so we do expect that there will be less volume growth in 2025 related to healthcare exchanges than we saw in 2024. That's one of the big drivers of the pullback there. I mentioned earlier that we had an admission benefit related to the Medicare Advantage Two-Midnight Rule in 2024 that I don't think repeats in 2025. And so -- and then the other thing would be the Medicaid redetermination process that was down this year. I think it flattens out next year. So all in, we're still forecasting what we think to be strong demand for healthcare services in 2025, 3% to 4% growth is still above our long-term guide of 2% to 3% and feels rational as we think about the balance of 2025 compared to where we landed in 2024.
Sarah James: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jamie Perse: Hey. Thank you, good morning. Just on M&A, you guys have had a couple of smaller transactions recently. I wanted to see what you're seeing just in terms of market activity, how you're thinking about the portfolio overall, including adding scale in existing markets or going to new markets. And just the aggressiveness you guys could show on the deal front in 2025?
Sam Hazen: So, our primary growth in capacity is going to be through capital spending and, I'll call it, organic measures where we add bed supply, we add outpatient facilities, as we mentioned. Those are central elements to our network development strategies and have proven to be very successful and have proven to be very productive from a capital return standpoint. We have, as you've mentioned, added, when we can, to our existing networks. We bought outpatient businesses. We've complemented our hospital networks with rural facilities and surgical facilities and so forth. And that will continue, I think, into 2025. We don't necessarily have any significant items to point to at this particular juncture. However, we do have a new hospital acquisition that we are expecting to close in the first quarter in Manchester, New Hampshire. That will add to and round out our New Hampshire network and give us a fairly broader and more productive, we think, overall Southern New Hampshire network. We're excited about that. But most of our investments are going to go towards, I'll call it, just organic system development. We'll have to wait and see if the market starts to shift and more inorganic growth opportunities develop, but at this particular point, we're not anticipating anything material.
Jamie Perse: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Langston from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Ryan Langston: Hi, thanks. Same-store inpatient surgical growth looked pretty strong in the quarter. Can you maybe just give us a sense on the types of procedures that was driving that? And outpatient surgical again, was down, I think the last couple of quarters. You've said that was mostly in the Medicaid and uninsured categories. Maybe I missed it in your commentary, but I'm just wondering if that's still the case? Thank you.
Sam Hazen: So, this is Sam. On the inpatient side, we did see a very solid growth in the quarter, fairly broad-based. Again, I think our diversified array of service offerings allows us to move through cycles and then also have less risk with the programs that we have. But we saw strong neurosciences. We saw strong orthopedics. We saw solid general surgery and vascular. So, it's really broad-based on the inpatient side. On the outpatient side, again, it's driven largely by Medicaid declines, which were down 10%. Our commercial and exchange volumes were up a little over 1%. Self-pay was down. So, that's why we indicated that our revenue growth and our profitability growth within our outpatient surgery category was up again in the quarter and for the year, because of the mix and the payer mix, and that's added to more capacity for those types of cases. So, we're not concerned about the outpatient surgery activity in the company when we look underneath the hood.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Steve Baxter: Hi. Thanks for the question. Just trying to understand some of the moving parts in the quarter a little bit better. I mean, it looks like broadly, you met expectations in the quarter, but the Medicaid supplemental benefit on a full year basis is now, I think, $200 million larger than what you discussed on the third quarter call. And hurricanes, I think, came in at maybe the end of guidance range that you previously provided. I think what people are trying to square those moving parts and whether that's the right way to think about it, or that's a misinterpretation of how to look at the quarter? Thank you.
Mike Marks : Sure. Hi, this is Mike. The way I would frame fourth quarter, as you kind of think through the moving parts here, the first, as we've mentioned, would be the hurricane impact as noted. In terms of the supplemental payment benefits, I think our description of the fourth quarter having the lowest portion of the net benefit in supplement payments for the year is kind of a good way to think about that component. And then a couple of other things I might mention when you're thinking about our fourth quarter 2024 earnings growth or adjusted EBITDA growth would be one, that fourth quarter of 2023 was very strong. So it was a little bit of tougher comparison in fourth quarter of this year to last year. And then the second thing just to keep in mind, and this is somewhat related to the depressed respiratory season, is that our admission growth in the quarter was at 3% versus if you think about more akin to 5% September year-to-date of 2024. So those are some thoughts. I might mention that if you look at that kind of growth rate, we do believe it's consistent from a launching point as we think about the midpoint of our 2025 guidance range as well. So we're pleased with the quarter and felt like given everything the company was dealing with in the fourth quarter of 2024, it was a good quarter.
Steve Baxter: Thanks. And just to clarify, the Tennessee portion of the 2024 payment recognized in the fourth quarter or is that in the 2025 guidance now? Thank you.
Mike Marks : Yes, it was not recognized in fourth quarter of 2024. It will be a 2025 event.
Operator: [Technical Difficulty] line of Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Could you speak a little bit more to the ASC performance in the quarter? Maybe more specifics on rate versus volume underneath that 5% to 6% revenue growth that you talked about? And then more broadly, how you think about the opportunity. And I'm specifically interested, are there any markets where you've got significant inpatient acute care share, but maybe not there on the ASC side yet?
Mike Marks : So let's kind of start with the numbers. We're at 124 surgery centers now. In my previous comment, I mentioned that the net revenue was up 5% to 6% in the quarter. The case volumes were down 1% in the quarter. We feel good about our ambulatory surgery center network. They're an important part of our overall network in the markets we serve. And it will be -- it will continue to be a part of our network development and optimization work as we go through into 2025 and beyond as part of that work. Sam, I don't know if you have a
Sam Hazen: Well, I'm sitting here just sort of canvassing across the company and thinking about the number of surgery centers vis-à-vis the number of hospitals that we have. And we do have a few markets for a variety of reasons that don't have sort an average number of facilities per hospital. We've talked about, on average, we have roughly 14 outpatient facilities, including ASCs, clinics, urgent care and so forth per hospital. That's an average. We have in some markets because there's no certificate of need in some markets where we can move much more quickly and aggressively to build out our outpatient network in some markets like in Georgia, where they have restrictive CON, it limits our ability to execute a strategy, the same in Virginia and in North Carolina. So you have some differences because of those dynamics. Where we have sort of control over our own destiny, if you will, we're fairly consistent with a large outpatient network, including ASCs per hospital. So I'm really struggling to point to a particular market where we feel like we're out of physician, if you will, in this space. Mike talked about 125 ambulatory surgery centers. We probably have another 20 or 25 GI centers that we don't even include in our number, and that's part of larger outpatient network. Those continue to grow incrementally also. So I think the limitation for us is mostly regulatory, and we have to work our way through that, as you would expect, through that administrative process.
Joshua Raskin: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Lance Wilkes of Bernstein.
Lance Wilkes: Great. Thanks a lot. Could you talk a little bit about the progress on labor and labor you've been making? In particular, talking to the pace of hirings in like nurse and support staff 2024 and what the guidance is and what's implied in 2025. Maybe a little commentary on wage inflation? And then if you could just give a little background on what's the total exposure in the supplemental programs these days? And what would be the margin on Medicaid without those programs? Obviously, those are essential that kind of get to an appropriate margin level there. Thanks.
Mike Marks: Yeah. Let's cover labor first. I think a good way to measure the progress we've been making is kind of looking at our use of premium labor or contract labor, and contract labor continues to improve. It moved down 8% or so for the quarter to prior year. Our contract labor as a percentage of SWD was down to 4.6%, 4.5% in the quarter. And it really represents, I think, a lot of really good work that our teams have done, both in terms of improving the retention and reducing the turnover rates we've seen over last couple of years coming out of the pandemic and a lot of good work on workforce development, including targeted hiring. Our workforce development plan is robust. We've talked in the past about -- that we're continuing to add Galen College nurses in our key markets. We're continuing to see increases in enrollment in Galen, and we have a robust academic medicine plan where we go out and work with other nursing schools really across our markets. And we're a really large hirer of graduate nurses. So I think overall, the labor agenda has gone and progressed really well. In terms of wages in fourth quarter, the wages were stable, wage inflation was stable. And our guidance really contemplates, if you think about our margin guidance, really contemplate a steady operating environment as we head into 2025, including overall wage inflation being what I think is stable and rational. So we're in a good spot on labor. On Medicaid, I'll just mention this. When you take total Medicaid reimbursement, including the effects of supplemental payment programs on Medicaid, we're still short of covering the cost of care around Medicaid. These programs are important, and they're important to the industry and not just HCA, but the wide range of not for profit and public hospitals across America. So that's where I'll leave on margins for Medicaid.
Lance Wilkes: Great. Thanks.
Frank Morgan: Janine, maybe time for one more. We're right at the top of the hour.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Ben Rossi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Ben Rossi: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here for one last one. So your 2025 CapEx guide at about $5.1 billion. I think historically, you've weighted this to 50/50 growth between CapEx maintenance and growth CapEx. Just with the hurricane recovery, is there any shift in this prioritization in the near-term or is 50/50 still a fair consideration for 2025?
Sam Hazen: I think that's a fair number. The hurricane is not changing our capital spending. The dynamics in North Carolina really weren't around physical plant destruction. It was community destruction. Our hospitals mostly were on higher levels than the community as a whole, so we didn't experience it. In Largo, where we dealt with that, that was mostly repair costs, as Mike mentioned in his commentary. So our capital spending is really consistent and it's geared toward our network development. It's geared toward making sure we have the clinical capabilities and the environment necessary to deliver high quality care. So that will continue.
Ben Rossi: Got it. Thank you.
Sam Hazen: Thank you.
Frank Morgan: Okay, Janine.
Operator: That concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Frank Morgan for closing remarks.
Frank Morgan: Janine, thanks for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining the call. We hope you have a good weekend. We're around this afternoon if we can answer any additional questions. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes our conference call for today. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, welcome to the HCA Healthcare Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.
Frank Morgan: Good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen and CFO, Mike Marks. Sam and Mike will provide some prepared remarks and then we'll take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA shareholder Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Hi, good morning to everybody. Before we get to the financial results for the quarter, I want to share the heroic efforts of our people as they recently responded to, in less than two weeks, two major hurricanes that impacted some of our communities and facilities. Over the years, HCA Healthcare has developed industry-leading enterprise capabilities to support our hospitals during disasters. We have used learnings from past experiences, conducted extensive training, and built strong partnerships with key vendors to create a systematic approach to preparing for and responding to major events like hurricanes. These resources were put to use by our teams with outstanding results over these past few weeks as enough hospitals were in the path of these storms. But what's even more impressive is the unwavering dedication, remarkable bravery, and outstanding leadership demonstrated by the people in our company who worked throughout these storms and, in many instances, multiple days without rest to ensure our patients and colleagues were safe. Leveraging corporate capabilities effectively to support committed people in our facilities is fundamentally our formula for success. We call it the HCA way. It works well in normal times, it worked well in the pandemic, and now it has proven itself again in these hurricanes. A few of our communities were significantly impacted by these storms. This is especially evident in the Asheville area and parts of Tampa-St. Pete. Given the basic infrastructure role we play in our communities and the duty we have to be there for them in each situations, we have not veered from doing the right thing. I'm humbled by the determination and teamwork of HCA people. I'm honored to be associated with them and I'm proud of how they continually show up in difficult circumstances and deliver tremendously positive outcomes for our patients, each other, and their communities. They truly demonstrate that they are, above all else, committed to the care and improvement of human life, and I want to thank them for what they do to make this company great. Now to the quarter's results. Like the first half of the year, the results for the third quarter were strong and reflected solid revenue growth and margin improvement. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, increased 25% to $4.90. These results include an estimated impact of $0.15 per share from lost revenue and additional expenses caused by Hurricane Helene. While the rest of our hospitals and outpatient facilities in the path of the storms are fully operational, we have two hospitals that continue to deal with the aftereffects of the storms. First, HCA Mission Hospital, which is the only hospital in the Asheville area, was affected by Hurricane Helene and it has continued to operate and provide high quality patient care, even with significant city infrastructure in disrepair, and that's primarily water. As a consequence of this storm, we anticipate incurring significant expenses and lost revenue related to these issues throughout the remainder of the year. We also expect some continued, but we think manageable, impact into 2025. As it pertains to Hurricane Milton, which hit Florida in October, our HCA Florida Largo Hospital was flooded. It is currently closed because of damage to the building's infrastructure. We anticipate significant repair expenses will be incurred at this hospital during the fourth quarter, in addition to losing revenue. Our teams, however, are working around the clock to reopen it in late December. HCA Healthcare has numerous examples from past hurricanes where our hospitals have recovered from major storms and become more productive than pre-storm performance. I believe we can produce similar results with these two hospitals in time as we move beyond the aftereffects of these most recent storms. During the quarter, volume growth across our markets and service lines, while modestly affected by Hurricane Helene, was strong and broad based. On a same facilities basis, inpatient admissions grew 4.5% as compared to the prior year. Adjusted admissions also grew 4.5%. Emergency room visits increased 4.6%. Inpatient surgeries were up 1.6%. Other volume categories, including cardiac procedures, inpatient rehab admissions, and obstetric volumes had solid growth. Outpatient surgery was the only major service category that declined. It was down 2%. However, the revenue in this service line increased 5% because of acuity and payer mix. Payer mix across other service lines and acuity within inpatient services improved in the quarter. These factors helped generate same facilities revenue growth of 7.1%. We continue to believe the investments we are making in our network development agenda drive value for our patients and the organization. By the end of this year, we expect to have added approximately 600 inpatient beds and 100 new outpatient facilities, bringing our total sites of care to over 2,600. Currently, the company has around $6 billion of projects under development. These investments, which should come online over the next few years will add more capacity and create greater access across our networks, allowing us to meet the growing demand for healthcare services we anticipate in our markets. Before I turn the call to Mike, I want to close with a few early thoughts on 2025. Our planning process, which includes continuing assessments of the hurricane-related impact, has not been completed. So I will caveat my comments with the fact that it is always difficult to predict with certainty the various components of our business, and these preliminary views may change. With respect to volume, we went into this year believing that growth would exceed our long-term demand assumptions of 2% to 3%, and throughout the year it has. As we look to 2025, we assume volume growth will continue at elevated levels in the range of 3% to 4% for the year. With respect to our earnings outlook for next year, we believe that the strong volume growth assumption, coupled with an anticipated mostly stable operating environment, should generate earnings growth near or slightly above the upper end of our long-term target ranges for both diluted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA. As usual, in January, we will provide you with our guidance for 2025. And with that, I'll turn the call to Mike.
Mike Marks: Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with the third quarter. We produced good volume growth and margins, especially when considering the impact of the hurricanes. I'll start with a few details of the two storms that impacted us recently. Hurricane Helene made landfall in the Big Bend area of Florida on September 26th and impacted our communities and operations in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. We had 29 hospitals in the path of the storm which had to prepare and respond. And financially, we have seen a loss of revenue and incurred additional expenses during the preparation, during storm, and the response phases. As an example, we are expecting to spend at least $13 million on water supply to Mission Hospital and our other health care facilities related to Hurricane Helene through the month of October. And city potable water supply is not projected to be re-established at Mission Hospital for several more weeks. As Sam noted, we estimate that Hurricane Helene impacted the third quarter by $50 million or $0.15 per diluted share. Hurricane Milton hit the west coast of Florida just south of Sarasota on October 9 and impacted a large portion of the Florida peninsula. We had over 34 hospitals in the path of this storm that had to prepare and respond, including HCA Florida Largo Hospital, which is still under repair. As we think about the ongoing impacts of both major hurricanes, we anticipate additional expenses and loss of revenue will be approximately $200 million to $300 million or $0.60 to $0.90 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2024. This impact relates primarily to our hospitals in North Carolina and our Largo Hospital in Florida. These estimates do not include any insurance recoveries the company may receive in the future. I would like to add my appreciation to our care teams and all the HCA colleagues who provided support during these storms and my concern and prayers for the communities and the people impacted as we collectively recover and respond. It is a true honor to work with our colleagues and our physicians and to serve these communities. Now let me transition to our 2024 guidance. As noted in our release, we reaffirmed our 2024 estimated guidance ranges. Given the ongoing impact of the two major hurricanes on the remainder of the year, we estimate that the results are likely to be in the lower half of the ranges provided. Now to the results for the quarter. Sam reviewed our strong volumes, which resulted in revenue growth of 7.9% in the quarter over prior year. So I will focus on operating costs in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter improved 90 basis points over prior year. Labor cost as a percent of revenue improved 160 basis points from the prior year. We continued to see good results on contract labor, which improved 18% from the prior year and represented 4.6% of total labor cost. Supply cost as a percent of revenue increased 30 basis points over the prior year but were relatively consistent sequentially. Other operating cost as a percent of revenue increased 40 basis points over the prior year. Professional fee cost growth over prior year moderated to 10% and was flat sequentially to the second quarter. We had expense growth associated with Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs and we had increased repair maintenance costs related to Hurricane Helene. Medicaid Supplemental Payment Programs provided a modest benefit to our third quarter '24 overall results. So a lot of movement parts in the quarter, but this was a solid quarter with over 13% growth in adjusted EBITDA driven by strong core operating performance across our portfolio of markets. Moving to capital allocation, we continued to deploy a balanced strategy of allocating capital for long-term value creation. Cash flow from operations was $3.5 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures totaled 1.19 billion and we repurchased 1.79 billion of our outstanding shares during the quarter. We also paid 169 million in dividends. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage remains at the low end of our stated guidance range and we believe we are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective. Finally, as noted in our release, we now estimate capital expenditures for 2024 to be approximately $5 billion. This lower estimate is due primarily to the timing of capital projects and we continue to see good opportunities for investing in our business. With that, Frank, I will turn over the call to you for questions.
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Mike. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so we have as many as possible in the queue an opportunity to ask a question. Jeremy, you may now give instructions to those who'd like to ask a question.
Operator: Perfect, thank you so much. [Operator Instructions]. All right, the first question comes from the line of AJ Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
AJ Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Just maybe one point of clarification and then a question. So on the outlook comments for 2025, if we take the mid-2024 guidance, 14 billion, and take 250 to 350 million of hurricane impact off of that and then grow at the high end of your 4% to 6% range, we'd come up with something like 14.6 billion for 2025 and then we'd layer in hurricane recovery on top of that. I just want to make sure we're all walking away with the right framework. Is that what you're saying? And then my broader question, just to throw that out, would be on your volume strength. You now have anniversaries to pick up in volume post-pandemic we saw last year. Are there particular areas of service lines that are remaining strong that are worth calling out even as you anniversary what was strong trends last year?
Mike Marks: Thanks, AJ. This is Mike. As it relates to our 2025 commentary, let me say this. We generally believe that the ongoing effects of the hurricanes in 2025, which we, as Sam said, we think are manageable, will be primarily in North Carolina as we expect our Tampa facility to be operational by the end of 2024. And we took these storms and the potential lingering effects into 2025 into account when we set this being near or slightly above the upper end of our long-term growth range. As Sam noted as well, we will give much more context and details on our 2025 formal guidance in January. As it relates to volume, the only thing I might point in addition to the point that you made relative to, you know, strong volume pickups in the last part of last year, is that sequentially from Q2 to Q3 of 2024, we increased same facility admissions by 1.4%. And that sequential increase is in line with our past sequential trend. So, that's our sense of volume.
Sam Hazen: Yes, and let me add to that, AJ. I think, broadly, most of our service categories are growing really well. And we think the emergency room continues to be a very important solution for people in our communities. And it continues to grow and we continue to invest in it. And we continue to improve our patient outcomes with our ER optimization agenda. We continue to see good strength in our cardiac business broadly across the organization. And as I said, in terms of the geography of the company, we've had broad-based growth as well with very few challenges, if you will across the important markets of our company.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
Ben Hendrix: A lot of discussion this earnings season around claim denial activity. I was wondering if you could touch on denial trends broadly. And then related to 2 midnight claims specifically, back in July, you noted that you were just beginning to see adjudication of 2 midnight related claims from early in the year. As we approach year end, can you offer any observations on the adjudication activity you're seeing around 2 midnight? And is there anything informing your view of when we may see behavioral changes among payers and how they process those short-stay admissions? Thank you.
Mike Marks: Good morning, Ben. Thank you. Let me talk about denials generally first and then we'll pivot to midnight impact in the quarter. Ben, as we noted in our Investor Day, we have been working diligently on denial mitigation strategies through our integrated revenue cycle over the past several years. We certainly have seen payers ramp up the intensity level of their denial activities over the past several years. But given our focus and investment in these areas, we've been able to moderate the rate of growth in denial write-offs this year from prior year. So, denials were not a material impact to HCA in third quarter of 2024. A quick update on the Medicare to Medicare Advantage 2 midnight rule adoption. Our same facility total Medicare admissions increased 5.3% in the quarter. Traditional Medicare admits were basically flat. Medicare Advantage admissions were up 11% and we attribute approximately 2% of that 11% growth in Medicare Advantage admissions coming from the 2 midnight rule impact. This is equivalent to approximately 50 basis points of our overall admission growth and has remained consistent over the year. As we continue, as I think about the denial impact to your question on the 2 midnight rule, we do continue to see a modest reduction in the prior authorization denial trends for accounts with 2 midnights or greater compared to prior year so far in 2024. But we still have way too many denials. And we have a few large Medicare Advantage payers that are significant outliers driving these denials. For context, let me highlight a couple of comparisons of Medicare Advantage to traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage now represents 58% of total Medicare volume. The mix of observation to inpatients with Medicare Advantage is still significantly higher than traditional Medicare. Even now, nine months past the implementation of the 2 midnight rule. Lastly, the Medicare Advantage CMI adjusted length of stay ratio is approximately 10% higher than traditional Medicare, driven by payer-driven discharge delays. These drive cost burdens to providers. So as we're working with our Medicare Advantage payers, we're really trying to address two things. We're trying to address this denial burden and the cost burden. And so as you think about the adjudication process, we are starting to get, through the first quarters, denials all the way through the adjudication process. And now we are pursuing those through dispute resolution. As we've talked about before, dispute resolution can take a year to two years to fully complete. And so we are going to have to continue to pursue that strategy as we move forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Hynes from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Ann Hynes: Hi, this is Ann. Thank you. I guess part of my question you just addressed, when I think about pricing assumptions for 2025, when I think ahead, I'm assuming it might be a tough compare because you have this 2 midnight rule this year. You also had a nice shift from Medicaid to commercial next year and had some incremental DPP. So when we think of pricing next year, maybe in your initial guide, what do you have for maybe a benefit for a continued shift to this observation to inpatient status on the Medicare Advantage side? And maybe any incremental DPPs that you have included in your initial guide? Because I know some states are working behind the scenes to get more programs approved. Thank you.
Mike Marks: Hi, Ann. Let me say this. It's a little early to give a lot of details around 2025. And as we finish our planning process in January call, we'll give you all of those details. I would say this, though. Largely, I think our cash net revenue per adjusted admission, we're planning on somewhere between 2% to 3% growth in 2025. And that's our early look at that metric. In terms of payer contracting, I don't know if this is exactly where you're going, but I'll go ahead and give you the update that we're now 80% complete in 2025, 54% complete for 2026, and just short of 20% complete for 2027. And we're still tracking in that mid-single-digit update. So that's a quick update on the commercial side.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Pito Chickering: So tagging on there, sort of two questions here on pricing next year. Do you assume any GDPs in that guidance range that you gave us for next year? And as you think about labor and OpEx, I guess, what do you guys assume for labor and OpEx within that guide for next year? Thanks so much.
Mike Marks: So, yes, I would repeat that really we'll be getting into the details of our margin profile assumptions for 2025 when we have our January call, still in the middle of our planning process, a little early to be getting into those details now for third quarter. And so let me just stay there related to that. I'm happy to give you a quick waiver update, though, for third quarter. And so I'll do that here. As we've noted before, Medicaid has historically been our most challenging payer, other than patients without insurance. The growth in the Medicaid supplemental payment programs across our states over the past several years have helped. But these programs are complex and variable from quarter-to-quarter, and when taken together with historical Medicare reimbursement, are still short of covering the cost to treat Medicaid patients. This quarter really illustrates the complexity and variability of these programs. As noted in my comments, Medicaid supplemental payment programs produced a modest benefit in the quarter versus prior year. This modest benefit was generally the net effect of a reduction from the Florida program, given our change to accruing, as offset by receiving the North Carolina benefit in third quarter of '24 versus fourth quarter of last year, and then the new Nevada program that kicked in this year. We still project that we will have $100 million to $200 million tailwind from Medicaid supplemental payment programs in 2024 to prior year but would now lean to the higher end of that range.
Sam Hazen: Mike, let me just add something, Pito. I think, as I mentioned in my comments, that we anticipate a stable operating environment for 2025. That suggests demand sort of in the zone, as we talked about, which is better than our long-term assumptions around demand. Mike just spoke to our pricing and reimbursement environment being generally consistent and sort of programmed for 2025. And then with respect to our costs, we do think inflationary trends are generally consistent with what we've seen on the labor side for 2024, and we have reasonable assumptions around the rest of our costs to be somewhat stable and in line with sort of 2024. Now, we're putting a finer point on that as we finish the year and land on a few things. So, that's how we're characterizing a stable operating environment.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Mock from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Andrew Mok: Looks like there was a deceleration in inpatient revenue per admission from 6.5% in the first half of the year, which was very strong, to about half of that in the third quarter. I just want to understand the underlying drivers there between acuity, mix, and rate. Thanks.
Mike Marks: So, when I think about the NRA growth rate in third quarter versus kind of year-to-date or the first half of the year, as you know, really all of the decline in the growth rate is driven by state supplemental programs. We had growth in Medicaid supplemental program revenues in third quarter of 2024 to prior year, but well below the growth rate in the first half of 2024 to prior year. Consistent with the first two quarters of 2024, we had good growth in acuity and strong payer mix in the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joanna Gajuk from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joanna Gajuk: So, maybe I guess on the payer mix a little bit additional question here in terms of the exchange volumes and the Medicaid volumes in the quarter. I guess you gave us Medicare, so also commercial volume growth in the quarter. So, maybe I can kind of give us additional, I guess, data points on the payer mix and the volume growth in the quarter by payer. Thank you.
Mike Marks: Sure. Good morning. So, I'm going to use equivalent admission growth in third quarter of 24 to prior year, same facility. And so, let's run down. Medicare up 5% on equivalent admissions. Medicaid down 8.5% on equivalent admissions. Managed care volume excluding exchanges up just short of 4%. The exchange volume was at 43% growth, same facility to prior year. And then uninsured volumes were up 7.2%. So, that equates to that total of 4.5% growth in equivalent admissions in the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Gerlach from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Wow! That's a name from the past. It's Justin Lake from Wolfe. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the long-term debt and your leverage and how you're thinking about that going into next year. It looks like you're kind of ending the year around 3x. And then I apologize. I know I missed a little bit of the beginning of the fall, but I know you got asked about the hurricane impact in there. But anything that I might have missed in terms of how you're thinking about the hurricane and the potential it reoccurs next year within your guidance or the year 6%? How are you thinking about that $300 million? Thanks.
Mike Marks: Great, Justin. So, as it relates to cash flow, we had a really strong quarter in third quarter '24. We did end right at the lower end of the range on our leverage target. We've talked about this before, but every year at this time as part of our planning and budgeting process, we're working with our Finance Investment Committee and doing an evaluation of financial policies and we'll announce any changes to those if there are any on our first quarter call. So, we're still in the middle of that planning process related to those kinds of financial policies, but we are at the bottom of that leverage ratio. And what we articulated related to the 2025 in hurricanes is just that we generally believe that the ongoing effects of the hurricanes in 2025, which we think are going to be manageable, are primarily in our North Carolina market as our Tampa facility will be operational by the end of the year. We did take that into account, Justin, when we crafted our early look comments at being near or slightly above the upper end of long-term growth ranges. And as always, we'll give you a lot more details and context around our 2025 look when we do formal guidance update in January.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brian Tanquilut: Mike and Sam, as I think about the work that you're doing with the communities and disruption, how are you thinking about insurance claims or insurance reimbursement? And then maybe, Mike, just any color you can share on the change to the CapEx guidance.
Mike Marks: Sure. Let me write that down. So, on insurance, and we noted this in our release, the impacts that we've noted related to fourth quarter and third quarter did not include any estimate related to insurance recoveries at this point. It's still early. We're working through that now. We do anticipate having insured losses related to these hurricanes. It's a little early yet, and we're really not in a position to provide an estimate either to the timing of a potential recovery or the amount, but we do believe that there will be a claim for sure given the size of these storms. Related to the change in CapEx, it's really just the timing of capital projects. These are especially the bigger projects, as you know, take a long time, and the timing can flow a little bit up and down, but there's no implication there. We're still seeing a lot of really good opportunities to invest in our business, and so I would just articulate the slight decrease in what we think we're going to spend this year on CapEx being related more to timing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from SAP Securities (sic) [Leerink Partners]. Please go ahead.
Whit Mayo: Sam, you've had a big focus on the AI and technology investment. Just wondering if there's any new learnings, any efficiencies that you guys are seeing from those investments, maybe around labor management or other areas that you can share that you find encouraging that would be helpful. Thanks.
Sam Hazen: So, we yesterday actually presented our full plan on our digital agenda and how we are approaching advancing technology, and in particular AI, into the company's business over the next five to seven years, and we see many opportunities to improve our administrative functioning, our operational management of our business, and then ultimately the clinical outcomes for our patients, and so we're early. In that journey, we do have some areas where we're seeing promising results as it relates to using technology, and in particular artificial intelligence, more effectively. Some of that is in our scheduling capabilities where we've been able to improve the tools that our managers can use with more precise demand forecasting, better allocation of our workforce to meet the patient demands and such. So, that's encouraging and giving us a little bit of confidence. We have aspects of artificial intelligence embedded into our revenue cycle, as Mike mentioned, to manage the receivables performance and the revenue performance of the company more effectively and mitigate some of the denial pressures and so forth. So, those are early stage initiatives that are yielding positive results for us. They're not material yet, but we do see a growing set of initiatives. We're organizing around the agenda. We're going to be resourcing it even more as we push into the next few years, and we expect to get incremental improvements in '25 and '26 and on into the rest of this decade as we mature our efforts on this particular front. I mean, it's our view that we're at an inflection point. HEA Healthcare historically has performed at high levels across all elements of our business, I believe. Obviously, our growth has been good. Our margin performance has been good. Our clinical outcomes and quality performance to date is better than it was in 2019, so pre-pandemic to now we've improved our overall quality. And then with respect to our constituency engagements, employees, physicians, and even community, we've advanced that. So, we're at this incredible inflection point because of these tools, and in our business we see a lot of application, and so we're very excited about the potential that this particular agenda presents for our company.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: I just wanted to ask about the volume growth assumption for next year. Is it 3% or 4%? If I was looking back at last quarter, I think you suggested the exchange is potentially worth as much as maybe 200 or 250 basis points of your growth this year. I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about some of these unusual coverage dynamics in the exchanges. And I guess for Medicaid, it's a headwind this year. Does it keep declining as you think about next year? Is that stabilized? Just trying to understand some of these more macro-driven dynamics inside your volume assumption. Thanks.
Mike Marks: Yeah, great question. Largely, I think exchange enrollment will moderate next year. Maybe in the 8% to 10% growth in enrollment is the best estimates we have versus in our states this year, enrollment growth was over 30%. So, that's one factor, certainly. I do think that Medicaid volumes will flatten out a bit in 2025 versus 2024 as we kind of sunset through the Medicaid redetermination process. So largely, I would say those are the two biggest dynamics. I think the net effect of that will be generally stable payer mix as we move from 2024 to 2025.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: I'm interested if you can update us on the contracting environment with Medicare Advantage plans, just separate from the two midnight rule dynamic and sort of how those trends have been playing out as some of the MA plans, or a lot of them, have been experiencing a lot of pressure on their rates and margins as well. And then just a quick follow-up, just around the '25 preliminary outlook, understanding it's only early, would there be any view on the impact on the cadence of EBITDA just around the impact from the hurricanes and the timing of recovering from that? Thanks.
Mike Marks: Let me cover the contracting piece, and then we'll jump to your second question. Generally speaking, we're largely contracted across the major Medicare Advantage payers. And as we've done our normal kind of set of renewals in 2024, we've been able to come to agreement with our payer partners in the Medicare Advantage space. That is our intention to continue to do that. We continue to work with our Medicare Advantage payer partners to work through the challenges that they have and that we have as a provider in their contracted network. But in terms of contracting, I would say that we are fairly consistent with where we've been in the past, which is largely contracted. And we've been able to secure renewals as we've gone through our 2024 renewal cycle. In terms of cadence of EBITDA, again, I think it's a little early to get into trying to think about earnings by quarter in 2025 at this point. So I'll push that answer to when we come together in January.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Langston. Please go ahead.
Ryan Langston: I mean, hurricanes are just kind of a fact of life in the southern states, typically not as severe, of course, as this year, but you did see some effects a couple years ago. I don't think you'd be overly reactive to this, but does this maybe cycle of hurricane activity do anything to affect sort of long-term strategy on capital allocation, M&A in terms of building, buying facilities, and maybe look outside of those geographies, even if only maybe somewhat incrementally? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. I think the short answer to that is no. We have seen our facilities, as I mentioned in my comments, recover. I'll just give you an example. Hurricane Ian, which affected our hospital in Port Charlotte, HCA Fawcett Hospital, a couple of years ago, that hospital was actually repaired, hardened, if you will, to hurricanes, and we're actually performing at a higher level than we were pre-Hurricane Ian. Hurricane Michael, which hit Panama City, Florida, also has been repaired significantly and hardened some as well. Obviously, a hurricane could hit it again and damage it, but that hospital is performing at a higher level than it was pre-storm. Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston a number of years ago and was a significant flood event, as a result, our Houston system has recovered and is also exceeding pre-Harvey performance as well. We still believe that the state of Florida, the Gulf Coast of Texas, and so forth, are very significant opportunities for our company. We believe wisely in those communities. We harden our facilities as much as we possibly can, but they are, in fact, a way of life. I will tell you, this year and I had personal experience with Katrina, it's very similar to the effects of Katrina. I mean, Hurricane Helene was a Category 4 storm, and if you would have asked me what two communities were most impacted, I would have never said, in 100 years, Augusta, Georgia, and Asheville, North Carolina. And so we dealt with an unprecedented storm, and again, HCA, we showed the power of the company, I think, but more importantly, the power of its people to respond to that, and I think we're going to be stronger as a result of it in those markets. We believe that our portfolio of communities that we serve are very well positioned for long-term growth, as we've indicated. We understand the risk associated with hurricanes and such. That's why we built the capabilities that we've got, and we think we're diversified enough across those communities to deal with that particular risk.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. Outpatient surgical trend remained negative despite a lower comp. In your 4Q and '25 guide, do you assume that stabilizes or turns positive? What's driving that pressure? And then just a quick clarification on the business interruption insurance comment that you made, what level of insurance do you carry? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: So, on outpatient surgery, as we indicated, nothing's changed from the trends we've seen this year. The declines have been focused almost entirely in Medicaid and uninsured. That's why our revenue per surgical case has been up 7%. We've seen acuity growth, and we've also seen a payer mix improvement in our outpatient surgery. The profitability of our outpatient surgery service is better as a result. So, on the headline, volume is down. On the bottom line, profits are up with respect to outpatient surgery. So, we're comfortable with that outcome. As it relates to next year, we don't anticipate any significant changes at this particular juncture. We believe our overall volume guidance includes the different categories that we've got. Our efforts on outpatient surgery continue to advance. We're advancing the number of surgery centers that we have in our company through greenfield development, as well as some targeted acquisitions. And we continue to improve the operations of our hospital-based outpatient surgery centers, providing better environments for our physicians and better care environments for our patients.
Mike Marks: And on your insurance question, we certainly have business interruption coverage as part of our property insurance program. But at this time, we're really not in position to provide estimates related to either the timing or the potential recovery under those insurance policies or the limits thereof. So, that's where we are now.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom. Please go ahead.
John Ransom: Just kind of backing up, I'm trying to think about things that we worried about five years ago that we don't talk about anymore. And one thing that comes to mind is value-based care and all that stuff. And I'm just curious, your commercial contracts in particular, I know they're fee-for-service, but what kind of kickers do you get in 2024 for things like hospital-acquired infections, readmissions, other quality metrics? What kind of kickers are you getting now versus then? Have they grown? And what are some examples of that? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: John, this is Sam. Those are very incremental inside of our overall revenue contracts with payers. And I won't say they're de minimis, but they're not material to the overall escalators that we have or the overall revenue equation inside of those contracts. We have some contracts that have modest provisions around those, but when you aggregate it for the company as a whole, it's a very small component of the escalators that we get. I mean, we are committed at our core to providing better care to our patients. And that's part and parcel to why our quality outcomes, as I mentioned, are better than they were in 2019. And we have a robust agenda across the organization to improve the outcomes for our patients, including some of the service metrics that you referenced there. So that's sort of core to how we approach it. And it's embedded, I think, in the offering of HCA facilities to payers and their members. And that's allowed us, we believe, to get to a point where we contract on a pretty consistent cycle. We've actually advanced the number of commercial contracts this year that we participate in with two major contract signings, Kaiser in Denver and then Blue Cross of Tennessee in Chattanooga. So we have very few commercial contracts across the country now where we don't participate. It's less than a handful. And we think that's a result of our access capabilities with our outpatient platform, as well as our quality and comprehensive service offerings that we provided back in our facilities.
John Ransom: If I could just tag on, when you define quality, I know that's an amorphous concept to some people, but what's the data set that you use and how has that changed? Thanks. I'll ring off now. Thank you.
Sam Hazen: I mean, I don't know that we have enough time on this call, John, to talk about the data set that we have around quality. I mean, we have an increasing data set around quality. We have better insights into it as an organization. It includes everything from complications to mortality to hospital-acquired infections to length of stay to specific service line metrics for cardiovascular care, for bone marrow transplant, for ER processing, as I mentioned before. I mean, I can go on and on about it. We have a very integrated quality agenda with our leadership corporately and with our hospital teams. And all of that comes together in an advanced state for us as an organization. As we think about AI and the question that Whit asked earlier, we see that as the next frontier, allowing us to get even better at it, more efficient, and more transparent. So, it's really a fairly comprehensive program that we've continued to grow simply because our service offerings are more complex. Our ability to use our quality to attract physicians and patients and be more responsive to our communities is just sort of core to what we do day in and day out.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Lance Wilkes: Can you talk a little bit about some of the improvements you've been seeing in your wage and compensation expense ratio? In particular, what sort of wage inflation you're seeing currently in your contracting with nurses, et cetera? What your growth rates are looking like there? And then maybe just a quick cleanup, if you could just talk a little of the bad debt impacts you're seeing as a result of Medicaid redetermination, that'd be great too. Thanks.
Mike Marks: So, generally speaking, as we've come through this year, the wage rates that we're seeing across our markets are generally pretty stable. I think we've remarked before somewhere between the 2.5%, 3.5% range is about kind of what we're seeing. And if I think about for next year, as Sam mentioned, that we're anticipating and planning for a fairly stable operating environment, including wage inflation. So, that would be the wage part of that. On bad debt impacts, as we noted, I would use just the volume as an example. But if you think about the uninsured volume growth for equivalent admissions in the quarter at about 7%, we give you a sense of that. But in terms of bad debt or uninsured costs, it's pretty stable. And we don't anticipate significant changes to the stability as we go into next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Craig Hettenbach: Mike, can you touch on just the resiliency program of $600 million to $800 million savings? Just how are you thinking about that in 2025 and beyond from a timing perspective?
Mike Marks: Yes, good question. As I think about resiliency, we continue to see good output from the results of our work around our resiliency program. A few points of that would be, one, the length of stay agenda or case management agenda, where this year we've seen about a 1.5% reduction in our length of stay this year, which has been very helpful as we've managed both our labor and our capacity as we've gone through this year and accommodated additional volume growth. Labor management, which we've just talked about as we've gone here through the third quarter, our resiliency actions have allowed us to show margin improvement in labor and really contributes to, as we think about 2025 and beyond, using this resiliency program to help fund and support the investments that we're making in our tech and innovation programs and still allow us to produce good returns to our global set of stakeholders. So generally speaking, I'd say we're on track. And as we noted in Investor Day, the next two or three years here are going to be largely using our resiliency program to pay for tech and innovation investments. And then as we kind of move deeper into the decade to support our margins and deal with the challenges that may come. But I'm pleased with the current status and the trajectory of our overall resiliency program, and that would be a status update that I would give for now.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. And then just a quick follow up on professional fees leveling off on a sequential basis. Do you expect that to be stable in 2025 as well?
Mike Marks: Well, it's again a little early to be given that level of detail for '25. Clearly, we are pleased and encouraged with the work that our operating and our physician services teams have been doing to deal with the pressures and really specifically in the hospital based physician world. As you kind of walk through the quarters this year, our first quarter grew 20% to prior year. Our second quarter grew 13% to prior year. And now in third quarter, we're down to 10%. And we were able to keep that growth fairly sequential from second to third quarter. I do think given what we're seeing and the results of our work that that's part of Sam's comment for next year of a stable operating environment. And so I think that I would for now until we get to January, I would largely articulate the [indiscernible] environment in that same concept.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jamie Perse: I was just looking for a Valesco update. What's the status of losses in the third quarter? Where are you in turning around that enterprise and getting improved pricing there? And just what are your latest thoughts on timing of when you can get that to break even or potentially profitable? Thank you.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. On Valesco, we're pleased with the integration that's happened this year. We were able to assimilate, as we've mentioned before, 5,500 physicians from that particular group into HCA management systems and so forth. Our objectives with Valesco are to get it to an appropriate level of financial performance. This year we are, in fact, on our plan, maybe slightly ahead of it, but it's not material to the company as a whole. Our long-term objectives with Valesco are to create an internal capability with this particular physician group that basically turns this into a strategic asset. And by that, I mean we have the ability to improve our clinical outcomes and quality results for our patients because we have a physician group that is fully integrated as an employed base inside of HCA. We can build more rigor, more routines, more standards in how we do clinical processing. The second thing we think we can accomplish in our journey to make it a strategic asset is to improve efficiency, embed these physicians more into how we manage our emergency rooms, how we execute on our case management agenda, and so forth. And then, thirdly, we think we can leverage this group to help us with our tech agenda, to help us with our growth agenda by building relationships with referring physicians and help us with outreach. So, those aspects of value creation that we see with Valesco far exceed sort of the financial performance inside the group. We continue to improve our reimbursement with the payers as it relates to hospital-based physicians, but these other elements provide more value, we think, globally to the organization and will be part and parcel to our core initiatives.
Frank Morgan: Okay, Jeremy, we'll take one more question.
Operator: All right, perfect. Our last question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin from Nephron. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin: So, I heard Medicaid adjusted admissions were down 8.5% in the quarter. It's actually not as big as the decline in total Medicaid lives in the market. So, I'm curious if these additional state sub-payments and sort of broad increases to Medicaid funding has impacted strategy around serving Medicaid patients. Are you thinking differently about capacity or service lines to Medicaid specifically?
Sam Hazen: Josh, this is Sam. Actually, no, the contrary. We are finding opportunities to improve offerings for Medicaid beneficiaries through some of our outpatient development in certain markets. The supplemental payment programs that Mike has alluded to over the past have created reimbursement in some situations where it makes it easier for us to invest in services and capabilities that help the Medicaid beneficiaries and produce better environments for them to get care. So, I don't see that anything has changed our core thinking around how we provide available services to that particular beneficiary, and we'll continue to evaluate that. I think for HCA as a whole, 17%, 18% of our adjusted admissions are Medicaid. So, it's a large piece of our organization. The decline this year is really centered around redetermination mostly, not funding from one state to the other. It was through that process of redetermination that some of the business moved amongst the payer classes as we've indicated over the year. That will slow down because we don't have a redetermination process next year, and we will continue to evaluate how to use our investments to properly allocate to meet the needs of our communities broadly and in some cases specifically for Medicaid.
Operator: All right. That is all the questions in the queue, so I'll turn it back over to Mr. Frank Morgan for closing remarks.
Frank Morgan: Jeremy, thank you for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. I hope you have a great weekend. I'm around this afternoon if I can answer additional questions you might have. Good day.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Have a pleasant day, everyone.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-23 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.
Frank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and our CFO, Mike Marks. Sam and Mike will provide some prepared remarks, and then we'll take some questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: All right. Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everyone. The Company's results for the second quarter were positive across the board and reflected strong demand for our services. In addition, our teams continue to execute our strategic plan effectively and produced positive outcomes for our patients, while also enhancing in our facilities, including better throughput and case management. I want to thank our HCA colleagues for their outstanding work and their continued pursuits to innovate and deliver on our mission. As compared to the prior year, diluted earnings per share as adjusted increased 28% to $5.50. Consistent with the first quarter, we saw broad-based volume growth across our markets and service lines. On a same facilities basis in the second quarter, inpatient admissions grew 5.8%, equivalent admissions grew 5.2%, emergency room visits increased 5.5%, inpatient surgeries were up 2.6%, outpatient surgery cases were down 2% and like the first quarter, the declines were mostly explained by lower volumes in Medicaid and self-pay categories. Similar to the past few quarters, other volume categories, including cardiac procedures and inpatient rehab services experienced strong growth. Payer mix improved year-over-year with commercial volumes representing 36.2% of equivalent admissions. And lastly, the acuity of our inpatient services as reflected in our case mix index increased slightly as compared to last year. These factors helped generate same-facility revenue growth of 10%. Also in the quarter, we progressed further on our cost agenda and produced solid operating margins. As we transition to the last half of 2024, we are encouraged by the Company's results. We believe the increased investments we are making in our people and facilities along with our disciplined approach to operations will continue to produce positive outcomes for our stakeholders. In closing, given our year-to-date performance and the backdrop of strong demand that we forecast for the remainder of the year, we have updated our guidance for the year, as indicated in our press release. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for more details.
Mike Marks: Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter showed continued solid performance with strong demand, improved margins and a balanced allocation of capital. Sam reviewed our top line results, so I will cover operating costs in the quarter. Operating costs were well managed, resulting in a margin improvement of 100 basis points to prior year and sequentially through the first quarter. Labor cost has improved 200 basis points from the prior year. And we continue to see good results in contract labor, which declined 25.7% from the prior year and represented 4.8% of total labor costs. Supply costs as a percent of revenues improved 50 basis points from the prior year. On other operating costs as a percent of revenue, they did grow compared to the prior year, but it remained relatively consistent for the past four quarters. We were encouraged that year-over-year same-facility professional fee costs growth moderated to approximately 13% in the second quarter, which compares favorably to the 20% increase we experienced in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.55 billion in the quarter, which represents a 16% increase over the prior year and included a modest benefit from Medicaid supplemental payments. As a management team, we are very pleased with the operational performance of the Company. Now moving to capital allocation. We continue to deploy a balanced strategy of allocating capital for long-term value creation. Cash flow from operations was just under $2 billion in the quarter, which is a decline of $500 million in the prior year, driven by income tax payments and timing of Medicaid supplemental program accruals and cash receipts. Capital expenditures totaled $1.28 billion, and we repurchased $1.37 billion of our outstanding share in the quarter. We also paid about $170 million in dividends. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage remains near the low end of our stated guidance range, and we believe we are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective. Finally, in our release this morning, we are updating estimated guidance for 2024. For revenues, our new guidance range is $69.75 billion to $71.75 billion; net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, $5.675 billion to $5.975 billion; adjusted EBITDA, $13.75 billion to $14.25 billion; and diluted earnings per share, $21.60 to $22.80 per share. Based on the strength of our year-to-date results and our revised outlook, we estimate that share repurchases will be around $6 billion in 2024, subject to market conditions. With that, I'll turn the call over to you, Frank, for questions and answers.
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Mike. [Operator Instructions] Ellie, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is now open.
A.J. Rice: Maybe just two areas that people are very focused on, supplemental payments. How is that running relative to your expectations? And in your back half comments, are you including anything for Tennessee? And then the other area being the public exchanges, what is the trend there year-to-year? And how much is growth in that helping for these strong results?
Mike Marks: Thank you, A.J., this is Mike. I'll take the supplemental question. I think as you're aware, Medicaid has historically been our most challenging payer, really other than patients without insurances, typically paying us significantly below the cost of carrying for Medicaid patients. Over the last several years, most states in which we operate have implemented or enhanced Medicaid reimbursement through supplemental payment programs. And while these supplemental programs are growing, it is important to put them in context. They can be complex, variable in their impact from quarter-to-quarter and when taken together with historical Medicaid reimbursement are still well short of covering the cost to treat Medicaid patients. We believe it is important to understand this backdrop when discussing these programs. But now to the quarter. In the second quarter, we recognized a year-over-year earnings increase of approximately $125 million related to our Medicaid supplemental payment programs driven primarily by the new program in Nevada and the accrual of the Florida program, which began in the fourth quarter of 2023. To your specific question about the new program in Tennessee, we -- that is with CMS for review, and we do not anticipate financial impact from that program in 2024. If you want to go to the public exchanges. For the quarter, and let me just kind of give commercial volumes in general first and then we'll kind of break out it. But our equivalent admissions for managed care, including our health care exchange volumes were up 12.5% in this quarter versus the prior year quarter. If you take our managed care volumes without health care exchanges, they were up just short of 5% on equivalent admissions. And for health care exchanges, we were up 46% over prior year for the quarter.
A.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Sam Hazen: So, on the volume, I think as I mentioned and Mike alluded to there, I mean our Medicare volumes were up, I think by 6.5%. So, the volume was supported really across all payer categories. Clearly, the exchange and the enrollment over the last three years or so has become a bigger component of the business but still relatively small in comparison to the other payer classes. But nonetheless, we did see good volume across all payer classes with the Medicaid, I think being the only category that was down.
Mike Marks: And Medicaid were down 10% on equivalent admissions, mostly related to Medicaid redeterminations.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.
Ann Hynes: We talk about SWB, it was down quarter sequentially, and it's usually flat. Is that just driven by contract labor improvements? And if you can give us just any details on temporary labor percentage total contract labor, things like that, that would be great.
Mike Marks: Sure. Thanks, Ann. Contract labor was down 25.7% this quarter versus prior year quarter. As I noted in my opening comments, contract labor as a percentage of revenue -- I'm sorry, percentage of SWB was at 4.8% in the quarter. This compares to 6.8% in the second quarter of last year and almost 10% at the height of COVID in early 2022. So, we're continuing to see the improvements from all the work we're doing around recruiting and around retention, and that's paying the dividends in contract labor. If you think about kind of wage inflation, wage inflation was stable and kind of continues to run where we expected it to run. So also, we are pleased with our later results for the quarter.
Sam Hazen: And seasonally, we do tend to drop from the first quarter to the second quarter because some of the payroll taxes that we have to absorb in the first quarter are consumed by the end of the quarter or the early part of the second quarter, and that tends to improve a little bit of our metrics simply because of the timing of those tax payments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Pito Chickering: Can you bridge us to the back half EBITDA raise for this year? What percent of the upside you're changing is coming from better volumes? What percent is coming from changes to pricing mix or acuity? And then, how is just coming from just better margin improvement coming from labor? And then finally, are there any changes to supplemental assumptions for the back half of the year versus original guidance?
Mike Marks: So, we're obviously really pleased with our year-to-date due performance. It kind of sets our thinking about the back half of the year. On the top line, our volume and payer mix for the first six months of this year were better than our original expectations. Solid labor management, as we just talked about, including the contract labor declines also contributed to our thinking around the kind of our results. As we move into the back half of the year, we believe most of these trends should continue. We anticipate volume growth to be in the 4% to 6% range for the year. We expect salary wages and benefits supplies and other operating expenses as a percent of revenue to run mostly where we did June year-to-date. Contract labor as a percentage of salary wage and benefits is projected to be in roughly in the mid-4% range in the back half of 2024. And we do expect professional fee expense growth to the prior year to moderate a bit more in the back half of 2024 as well. Specifically, on Medicaid supplemental payments, as you recall in our original guidance, we anticipate a headwind of $100 million to $200 million from the Medicaid supplemental programs. As we've noted previously, these programs are complex and have a lot of variability quarter-to-quarter. But given that we are now deeper into 2024 and have better visibility into the programs across our states, we now anticipate an approximate $100 million to $200 million tailwind in 2024 from Medicaid supplemental payment programs, most of which occurred in the first half of 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brian Tanquilut: Congrats on solid quarter. Maybe, Sam, just as we think about -- you called out Medicaid with the redetermination kind of dragging in volumes a little bit here. But still very, very good performance. So just curious where you stand now as you think about the sustainability of this elevated utilization trend.
Sam Hazen: Well, as Mike just mentioned, Brian, we do expect that these volume trends will continue throughout 2024. And we have had for -- including 2023, really solid volume growth. I think when we pull up and we look at volume for the Company and overall demand for our services, it starts with the markets that we serve. We are in markets, as we indicated at our Investor Day, that we think have solid characteristics that are going to support organic growth. That's the first thing. The second thing is the HCA network way. And that is how we build our network, how we execute inside of that. Our inpatient bed capacity is up 2% year-over-year. When you look at across all of our facilities, we've added a few hospitals in that as well, really small ones that are complementary. Our outpatient facilities overall are up 5%. So, our network development is a key part of our growth. And we think it's part and parcel to our ability to grow our market share, which we have grown, and we continue to see metrics that suggest our market share continues to be positive. The third thing for us is capital. We are investing heavily in who we are. We're investing in our network. We're investing in our people. We're investing in clinical technology for our physicians. And we're finding ways to use our capital to make our services better and produce better outcomes for our patients. So, this year, we'll invest somewhere around $5.2 billion, which is significantly up over the last couple of years, and we continue to see opportunities inside of our organization to invest capital. The next area, it's hard for us to know this, but we do believe that coverage -- when people are covered whether it's through the exchanges mostly, through their employers, through Medicare, they tend to purchase services. And so, coverage is up. So that helps elevate demand. And we are in really unchartered territories for growth in demand in a normal environment. And it's hard to know if there's a hangover from COVID, as we've mentioned in past calls and so forth, but we do believe the fundamental attributes of coverage help support demand growth. And then when you start looking across like we said earlier, the different payer classes, it's broad-based. It's broad-based across the different payers. It's broad-based across our services. I mean even obstetrics was up slightly in the quarter. So, we have seen just sort of a lift across all aspects of our business. And again, the diversification of HCA from market to market as well as the diversification from service allows us to participate in this demand growth, and we're pretty encouraged by what we see year-to-date and what we expect over the balance of this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Ben Hendrix: I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more on the sources of acuity strength that you continue to see when parse that out between maybe the two midnight rule investments and higher acuity capabilities, or if there's like we heard some MCOs talk about higher acuity and continuing Medicaid book and then maybe even some pull-through -- pull-forward of acuity ahead of members being redetermined off. So, I just wanted to get any indication of kind of where you're seeing that acuity growth.
Sam Hazen: Well, this is Sam. Let me speak to our core strategy. And our core strategy is to create sort of a one stock capability within our systems. And by that, I mean, the ability to take care of a patient's need regardless of what their condition happens to be. So we, over time, have built complexity in the services that we've offered. So we've enhanced trauma programs. We've enhanced transplant programs. We've enhanced neonatal services. We've opened up our infrastructure with our transfer centers with helicopters, with ground transportation. We've interacted with the rural community in a way that support health care needs there, which typically tends to be more acute care service requirements than not. And so, all of that has been part and parcel toward our network strategy over the years. I will tell you, again, we had broad-based service growth in trauma in the number of ambulance deliveries that occurred at our hospitals, our cardiac care. Our cardiac surgery was up. So, we had -- neonatal admissions were up. All of these components that I mentioned that are essential to our network strategy saw growth. And so that has naturally lifted the case mix and the acuity of the patients that we serve. The two mid-night rule is actually dilutive when it comes to our case mix on the inpatient side. So, we jumped over the implications of the two midnight rules because those are lower acute patients deserve -- deserving to be in an inpatient status, but none the less than average equity by comparison. So, our quarter suggests that the acuity and the complexity of the services that we offer is even more than what it reports out simply because of the dilutive effect of the two mid-night rule.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Justin Lake: Sam, wanted to get your view on one of the bigger questions we're all getting from investors heading into the election, which is the potential for exchange disruption should the enhanced subsidies be allowed to expire at the end of 2025. Has the Company run a scenario analysis of what happens to these volumes and hospital economics should those subsidies expire? And if not, maybe you could just share with us what you think happens to those patients in terms of coverage, who might drop from the exchanges? Do they become uninsured? Do you think they move to other payer types? And then if I could just squeeze in a numbers question. Can you tell us what same-store ASC revenue growth was in the quarter?
Sam Hazen: On the exchanges, Justin obviously, there's a lot to play out here politically between now and the end of the year. So, it's a little premature for us to forecast what's going to happen politically with respect to the exchanges. It's no secret that they are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025. And many of the participants are in states that we serve, obviously, you've all seen that in the data that's available. We don't have a great line of sight on which participants in the exchange at what level of subsidies and how that will play out. It's really difficult for us to know precisely what that is. We are starting to try to study as much -- study. And we're hopeful that in 2025, we'll have some sense of the policies that might be put forth a better sense of the economics around the exposure if the subsidies go away. But at this point in time, it's way too early for us make any judgments on that. But we will be as transparent as we possibly can be with you all around it once we have information that we feel we can support and share appropriately.
Mike Marks: On same-store ASC revenue growth is about 8%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.
Whit Mayo: Sam, you've talked a lot in recent quarters around the efficiencies and the throughput initiatives that you've had in the ER. Any numbers that you can share around any of those productivity gains that puts this in perspective, maybe we see it on the back end with length of stay? And just if you could comment on the commercial growth in the ER this quarter.
Sam Hazen: Okay. Let me start with the commercial ER growth. Our commercial volumes in the emergency grew almost 18%. So really strong growth in that category. Again, we are focused on throughput, patient satisfaction and high clinical performance with what we call our ER revitalization program. And our ER revitalization program has produced positive results for us. Our throughput, let's start with time to see a patient, is down two minutes. That didn't sound like that much. Well, we're moving from 11 to 9 minutes. That's the starting point. Our length of stay for patients who have been discharged is down, I think, about 15% to 20% to around 160 minutes or something in that zone. Again, throughput, getting the patient through the systems, communicating with them effectively and then getting them out when they're ready to be out. Then we have patients who are admitted. For those patients, we've also improved the hold time in the emergency room, so we can get them up to a floor and in a proper setting for care. And that also has improved markedly on a year-over-year basis. We have room to go. And we're continuing to invest in our leadership development. We're continuing to invest in technology. We put our care transformation and innovation team inside of our ER processes to help them think about different approaches. Our patient satisfaction has improved in our emergency room. And I want to say over 8 out of 10 patients would highly recommend or recommend an HCA emergency room. In addition to that, we're adding capacity. We've added capacity on our hospital campuses, but we've also added capacity off campus to really meet the needs of different communities and that's been part of our growth as well. We continue to invest in both aspects from a supply standpoint. And then we're investing heavily in our process standpoint to make sure that we're delivering the searches that our communities need and that our patients deserve. And I'm really proud of the effort that our teams have put forth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Mok from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Andrew Mok: One clarification and a question. First, can you just give us the exchange admissions as a percentage of total in the quarter? And then on the question, outpatient surgeries were down about 2%. Can you elaborate on some of the trends you're seeing there? Maybe break that out between hospital outpatient and ASC volumes?
Mike Marks: Yes. So, on the exchange volumes, they're just right at 7% of admissions and ER visits as well for exchange as a percent of total. What was the second question?
Sam Hazen: It was on outpatient surgery. Yes, I got it, right. So we were down in the quarter, 2% in the hospital on the same -- we back up, that's not same store here, sorry. Yes, we're a little over 2% on same stores and a little over 1% on ASCs. And that weighted out to about the 2% that we mentioned. Again, it's exclusively in Medicaid and uninsured. So, our overall revenue growth in our ASC and hospital outpatient surgery platform was up. Our profitability on that segment was up. And yes, we have a volume metric that's down, but the implications to our business really aren't there as a result of it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Stephen Baxter: Just a couple more on the guidance. I was hoping to hear if you've updated your thinking on core wage inflation as part of this guidance revision. I'm wondering if that contributor potentially not due to the higher volumes you're staffing to. And then if there's any impact of M&A and the guidance [indiscernible] revenue and EBITDA that would be great to now too.
Mike Marks: If you look at wage inflation, as we kind of came in this year, we were thinking that 2.5% to 3% range, and that stays consistent as we think about where we are here and how we're going to kind of close to the back half of the year. So as -- thinking wage inflation will be fairly steady.
Sam Hazen: And then there's one on M&A.
Mike Marks: So, there were some questions on M&A. Let me just kind of run through that. So, you have $400 million of revenue in new stores. About $250 million of that is from Valesco. The rest are from the acquisitions in Texas, you heard us talk about the Wise Healthcare System acquisition couple of others. And that's the revenue side of that. It was dilutive to earnings, though and about 1% negative impact to EBITDA for the quarter. So, the M&A trends don't really impact or did not really impact our year-over-year EBITDA growth in any material way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Your line is now open.
Scott Fidel: I was hoping to just circle back on the Medicaid supplemental payments. And maybe if you can just sort of talk about how your Medicaid margins have evolved from maybe where they were a couple of years ago to where they are currently inclusive of the Medicaid supplemental payments. I know that you had mentioned how this is really just trying to get the business still on Medicaid back closer to breakeven or maybe not even there yet. So helpful if you could sort of walk us through that? And then just looking out to the elections, there is a level of investor uncertainty around the sustainability of Medicaid supplemental payments, if there was a switch in the White House, although I do think it's notable that we do see many of the states that are sponsoring these payments are from red states. So, it feels like these payments slightly would be quite sustainable. But there is a lot of investor uncertainty around this topic. So, we certainly appreciate your thinking on that.
Mike Marks: Yes, thank you. I'll take the second one first. We do see good sustainability around the Medicaid supplemental payment programs. As you noted, they're well supported historically, both in red states and blue states. And frankly, two of our biggest programs are in Texas, Florida. So that will give you a sense of those things. The new rule that came out earlier this year on sustainable programs, Medicaid supplemental programs, we found to be positive and supportive and actually good for the provider industry. If you think about kind of margins over time, if you go historically back in time, the Medicaid margins -- and you're right, I mean, supplemental payments are really just core to Medicaid, they were pretty significantly below the cost of caring for Medicaid patients in the past. Over the last several years, they have grown some and more states have added programs or enhanced programs. But even now, if you look at where we are in 2024, and you think about the historical base Medicaid reimbursement plus the supplemental payment reimbursement, it's still pretty well short of the cost of caring for those patients. So that's the context that we would provide on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Cassorla from Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Jason Cassorla: Just wanted to ask on CapEx. It sounds like you're maintaining your outlook there, but just in context of the higher 2024 revenue and EBITDA outlook. I just I guess curious if there's anything to call out on the CapEx side. And apologies if I missed this, but it sounds like maybe perhaps you're expecting to use the excess free cash flow from the guide raise just for share repurchase, or how should we think about that?
Mike Marks: We are not really revising our CapEx. As we started the year, we talked about $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. We think it's still going to generally be in that same range. As noted in our comments, we do expect based on the improved outlook and the updated guidance that we're going to spend about $6 billion in 2024 on share repurchase. So, the bulk of the increase from the improved results would be going towards share repurchase.
Sam Hazen: Let me add, Mike, if I may, it's Sam, to the capital. I think it's important to understand that we operate on an inpatient occupancy level in the mid -- low to mid-70s even in the second quarter, which is in addition to the fact that we added 2% inpatient bed as I mentioned. So our inpatient occupancy continues to grow, reflecting the acuity of our patients, reflecting the overall demand and reflecting the market share gains that we believe we're experiencing. The second piece is our ambulatory network development. Again, we have about 2,600 outpatient facilities and clinics across the Company, up 5% from where it was last year. Those are a component of our capital spending as well. And we will continue to look for opportunities from one market to the other to build out a network that serves our patients as we need to serve them. And the third piece is infrastructure. I mean we are in an infrastructure business. It requires us to have facilities that have the appropriate environment for our patients. We have to upgrade basic elements of those facilities and so forth. And so, a lot of that is maintenance. So, half of our capital goes towards maintenance to keep our facilities where they need to be. And then the last thing for us is technology. We are investing more in our technology agenda because we see opportunities for it to support the Company's next-generation growth and allow us to serve our patients even better. So, our technology component of our CapEx continues to grow. All of this is in the backdrop of our long-term view on demand. As we indicated in November at our Investor Day, we expect long-term demand to be in that 2% to 3% zone as well. And so, we have to build the necessary capabilities in our networks in our facilities to be able to serve that demand, and that's where our capital expenditure plan is intended to accomplish.
Mike Marks: Sam, let me clarify real quick. I said $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. It's actually $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion in capital spending for 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Kevin Fischbeck: It sounds like you believe that the volume and the demand support this volume as a kind of a base for the future. I wanted to see if you could give a little color on the margin side of things. Is this the right way to be thinking about the base when we think about ex year? Is there anything puts or takes that you would point to? I know sometimes when volume comes in stronger than you plan for, maybe there's a little bit more margin leverage than you would expect, and maybe that might moderate or whether you mentioned the timing in the past about some of -- payments. Is there any obvious headwind from timing from this year into next year we should be thinking about as we think about margins and EBITDA sustainability? Is this a good base for thinking about next year's growth?
Sam Hazen: We aren't going, Kevin, this is Sam, speak to 2025. I will tell you that we do not have any unusual event thus far through the first six months this year. This is core operations. And as Mike said, slightly by the Medicaid supplemental programs. So as sort of a core operational level of performance, it's really quite plain by comparison to some of the choppiness that naturally occurs with COVID, with the supplemental payment timings and so forth, with some of the challenges we experienced last year with just the inheritance of Valesco and so forth. But when we look at the first six months, and we think about the balance of the year, this is really a solid operational performance, supported by strong volume and not really unusual items benefiting or dragging the business in any material right. That's how I'd answer that question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Langston from TD Cowen. Your line is now open.
Ryan Langston: Just want to go back to labor for a second. Obviously, impressive results. Is there anything particular in recent achievements driving these results, maybe pass throughput and length of stay reduction and maybe how to think about that carrying forward over the next few quarters? And then just there is some potential M&A larger deals in the market, both on the hospital and the ambulatory side. Understand end market tends to be where you focus. But can you maybe just remind us of the parameters that you would need to entertain maybe a more larger market or national expansion?
Mike Marks: Yes. So labor, as we've already said, the biggest driver, if you think about our performance in the first half of the year compared to prior year was this reduction in contract labor. And that kind of comes through all the work we've been doing over the last several years, improving our recruitment activities and really working on retention. On the recruitment side, you've heard us talk about our academic affiliation work, our work around the Galen School of Nursing. And all of that has kind of produced improved supply of nursing into our markets, which has been super beneficial. I do think from a contract labor perspective, we're -- as I noted in my comments, we're down to 4.8% of contract labor as a percentage of salary wages and benefits. And I do think that the go-forward improvement, we'll still have some. We've guided, as you've noted from my comment on guidance that we think we'll run probably in the mid-4 range in the back half of the year. So, there's some improvement in the future. But I think the big move on contract labor from the highs of COVID really have been reflected now and what's to come is more incremental improvement as we continue to work on recruiting and retention. So that would be my -- I don't see anything other than that. It's material related to driving our labor trends. I mean productivity remains good. Wage inflation has been stable especially kind of coming off COVID and into 2024. So, those are the major things that we think about when we think about from now to the back half of the year.
Sam Hazen: And Mike, let me just put a wraparound that. I mean our focus now is finding ways to help our employees succeed even more at what they do. So, we are investing in education of our existing workforce just as much as we're investing in education and new nurses and so forth. We are improving our processes around supporting our caregivers so they can deliver better care. So, we have a number of initiatives that are connected to our nursing operations and so forth that really make sure that we have resources and support for our caregivers on a day in and day out basis. And we're investing heavily in our leadership because good leaders produce good outcomes for our patients and good outcomes for the organization. So those things are wraparounds to what Mike just alluded to. With respect to M&A, we have added to our platform this year with some tuck-in acquisitions from one market to the other. And Texas, as Mike alluded to, we added a number of hospitals to our North Texas market, small but very complementary. And we're starting to see good results out of them. In Houston, as an example, we added an outpatient business to our network there. That has produced a very good outcome. We are built to be bigger. We know that, and we have the balance sheet to support that. But we're very selective around making sure that an acquisition fits the model and can produce the returns that we expect from acquisitions. Will we enter new markets? Hopefully, yes, but those opportunities haven't necessarily presented themselves. I don't know that we'll deviate from our model. Our model is more centered on making our system -- our local system works better, work better for the community, work better for our patients and work better for other stakeholders that are connected to it. We obviously could do that, but we don't think that's the best answer for the Company. And that's been part of what we define as the durability of HCA Healthcare. It's staying true to the model in ways that produce a really good outcome for our stakeholders. It's possible that something will cause us to deviate from that, but we haven't really seen it up to this point. So, our focus is on investing back in our business, doing selective strategic acquisitions that complement our networks where we can and really advancing our position in these great markets that we serve.
Mike Marks: And one more comment on labor. The other thing that was very helpful for us in the -- not only in the quarter, but year-to-date is this 2% reduction length of stay. So, if you think about kind of how did we service almost 6% growth in inpatient volume on the admission side, 2% reduction length of stay. Sam mentioned this, we had a percent increase in our bed count from our capital investment program and then our occupancy levels were up 2%. But that 2% drop in length of stay and the ER efficiency that Sam mentioned earlier also supports our labor costs and the efficiency in the way we're managing our labor. So, I wanted to add that as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
John Ransom: Great job. Just curious, a question we're getting is, if you look at the back half, do you happen to have the DPP compare of '23 versus '24 in your back half?
Mike Marks: Here's what I would say about the guidance on the back half year. We talked about when we came this year that we thought we would have a headwind of $100 million, $200 million for Medicaid supplemental payment programs. As we've gotten deeper into this year, we're now kind of changing that or updating that to a $100 million to $200 million tailwind. So, if you think about that flip of $200 million to $400 million, I would tell you that much of that already occurred in the first half of '24. So, if you think about the back half of '24, what we're expecting for supplemental payment programs will look pretty similar to what we had in the back half of 2023.
John Ransom: Okay. And if I could just sneak one more. M&A, what is the year-over-year M&A contribution to EBITDA? Because it looks like in your cash flows, M&A has been quite modest, but it looks a little bigger in your table. So, can we kind of -- and was that fully in your guide, the M&A effect when you guided for '24?
Mike Marks: It is. I mean, as I said earlier, if I think about M&A or another way to think of that is kind of new stores. It was -- for the second quarter is about a 1% dilution to EBITDA for the quarter in terms of the impact from M&A activity. That includes, by the way, Valesco. I mean I would note that Valesco moves into same-store in 2025 and so you'll see us kind of stop talking about Valesco next year. But that M&A was not a material impact related to our earnings for the quarter.
Sam Hazen: And Mike, as it moves through the last half of the year, it gets slightly better. And we're hopeful that by the end of the fourth quarter, it's not dilutive.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. Your line is now open.
Joshua Raskin: Just getting back to the exchanges. I heard 7% of admissions now are coming from patients with ACA exchange coverage. What does that translate into revenues? And should we assume that those patients carry margins that are typical of the broader commercial population?
Mike Marks: What we typically say about our health care exchange payer category, it's our second-best payer. It's below -- from a reimbursement level, it's below commercial. It's above Medicare. So, it's in between those. So, it would have margins less than your typical commercial margins, but better than Medicare would be roughly what we're talking about. So, on 7% of admissions, if you look at revenue, something like 9% of revenues.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sarah James of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Sarah James: Can you give us some clarity if the commercial outpatient surgeries that were related to holidays in 1Q were rebooked? And then just taking a step back, if I look at outpatient surgical trends, first half last year was kind of mid-single-digit. Redetermination started and it dropped down to low single digits. Now, it's a negative 2% for first half of this year. So, is that like full change from the mid-single-digit first half last year to now be negative too, all related to Medicaid? And should we start to see that fall off in the back half of this year then as we start to anniversary some of the impacts?
Sam Hazen: Again, the volume declines on outpatient surgery are associated with Medicaid declines in that category as well as uninsured self-pay categories. So, both of those categories explained year-to-date, pretty much 100% of volume declines. I mean, there's a thesis inside of our company. It's not proven yet, that patients who migrated from Medicaid into the exchanges through the redetermination process, maybe in a different seasonality category with respect to when they access services. So that's a theory we have. We'll have to see how that plays out as we move through the balance of the year. But I think it's important to understand that the revenue growth -- the service level growth that we've seen in our outpatient surgery business has been solid and produced a pretty good financial outcome for the Company. And if, in fact, our thesis is accurate, it should be better in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. But again, we don't know that for sure. We need to experience this change in our business with this movement from one payer class to the other before we can land on that being the situation.
Mike Marks: Sarah, I would just add on Medicaid redeterminations. We're about one year into the redetermination process in most of our states. But you remember from last year, really started gaining speed towards the end of last year. So, I don't think you'll sunset or anniversary you're into the full Medicaid year-over-year comparison period until you get closer to the end of the year.
Operator: This now concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to hand back over to Mr. Frank Morgan for final remarks. Thank you.
Frank Morgan: Ellie, thank you so much for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We hope you have a great week and a successful earnings season. I'm around this afternoon, if I can answer any additional questions you might have. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, everyone, for attending today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir. 
Frank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then we'll take questions. 
 Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. 
 On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare is included in today's release. 
 This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam. 
Samuel Hazen: All right. Frank, thank you. Good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining the call. The positive fundamentals we saw in our business this past year continued into the first quarter of 2024. This momentum generated strong financial results that were driven by broad-based volume growth, improved payer mix and solid operating margins. As we look to the rest of the year, we remain encouraged by our performance, the overall backdrop of growing demand for our services and our enhanced stability across our networks to serve our communities. 
 The people of HCA Healthcare continue to deliver for our patients with improvements in key nonfinancial metrics, including improved quality outcomes, more efficient process measures in emergency room services, which have accelerated time to discharge and increased satisfaction, and finally, better inpatient capacity management with reduced length of stay and increased acceptance of patients who needed to be transferred to our hospitals. 
 As compared to the prior year, diluted earnings per share as adjusted increased almost 9% in the first quarter to $5.36. Same-facility volumes were favorable across the company. Inpatient admissions grew 6% year-over-year, inpatient surgeries were up almost 2%, equivalent admissions grew 5% and emergency room visits increased 7%. Most of our other volume categories, including cardiac procedures and rehab admissions, also had solid growth metrics in the quarter. 
 While outpatient surgery revenue increased year-over-year due primarily to favorable payer mix, total cases declined 2%. We attribute most of this decrease to the effect of the calendar and the redetermination process, which drove a considerable decline in Medicaid volume. All the domestic divisions had growth in inpatient admissions and equivalent admissions. 
 And finally, payer mix and acuity levels improved as compared to the prior year. Commercial volumes represented approximately 36% of equivalent admissions. Last year, they were 34% of the total. The case mix for our inpatient business increased slightly, continuing the upward trend we have seen over the past few years. Same-facility revenue grew almost 9% as a result of these volume metrics, coupled with 3.5% higher reimbursement per equivalent admission. 
 We continue to make progress on our cost agenda. Operating costs across most categories were in line with our expectations. As part of our capital spending plan, the number of facilities or sites for care increased by almost 5% to around 2,600. And we added approximately 2% to our inpatient bed capacity. As we move through the remainder of the year, we will maintain a disciplined approach to our operations while continuing to invest appropriately in our strategic agenda, which we believe should position the company favorably to meet our long-term objectives. 
 With that, I will turn the call to Bill for his last earnings call. I want to congratulate him again on his tremendous career with the company. It's been my privilege to work with him over these years, and I want to thank him for a job well done. 
William Rutherford: Great. Good morning, everyone. And thank you, Sam, appreciate that. We believe our first quarter performance represents a strong start to the year, and we continue to combine solid operational performance with a disciplined and balanced allocation of capital to generate value over time. 
 We had strong top line growth with revenues growing 11.2% over the prior year in the quarter. Sam highlighted the same-facility volume, acuity and mix metrics that drove our almost 9% same-facility revenue growth in the quarter. So let me highlight a few points on our operating costs. 
 Overall, operating costs were managed well. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.3% in the quarter. Labor results were solid with as-reported labor cost as a percent of revenue improving 100 basis points from the prior year. We continue to see good trends on contract labor, which improved 21.7% from the prior year and represented 5.1% of total labor cost. Supply cost as a percent of revenues improved 10 basis points from the prior year. 
 While other operating costs as a percent of revenue has grown compared to the prior year, it has remained relatively consistent for the past 3 quarters. The sequential growth of professional fee expense contributed -- continued to moderate and performed in line with our expectations. In addition, the Valesco operations performed better than our expectations in the quarter. 
 Adjusted EBITDA was $3.35 billion in the quarter, which represented a 5.7% increase over prior year. I will mention, as a reminder, we recorded a $145 million favorable settlement in the first quarter of last year. So we are pleased with the operational performance for the company during the first quarter. 
 Next, let me speak to capital allocation as we continue to employ a balanced allocation of capital. Cash flow from operations was just under $2.5 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $1.1 billion. And we repurchased just under $1.2 billion of our outstanding shares during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage remains near the low end of our stated guidance range. And we believe we are well positioned from a balance sheet perspective. And finally, in our release this morning, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 guidance ranges. 
 So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank and open it up for Q&A, and we look forward to your questions. 
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. [Operator Instructions] Operator, you may now give instructions for those who'd like to ask a question. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from [ Credit Suisse ]. 
Albert Rice: Obviously, the inpatient side of the business was quite strong. I wondered if there were service areas that were particularly strong. Or was there anything else that you can highlight? I know at one point, as you talked about laying out the year, you thought maybe the first half comparisons would be stronger than the back half. I don't know if that's still your view. Any comment along those lines would be interesting as well. 
Samuel Hazen: A.J., it's Sam. As I mentioned, we had broad-based volume growth across the company. Every division had growth in inpatient admissions. Actually, we had the best portfolio performance, I think, I've seen in my experience in the company with 56 of our hospitals growing greater than 10%. So almost 1/3 of our portfolio grew by greater than 10%. We had another 1/4 of our portfolio grow greater than 5%, so really strong volume across the company broadly. 
 When you look not only at the divisions in the aggregate but when you disaggregate the divisions, within our hospital portfolio, you see similar performance metrics. As far as services, the service line volume growth on the inpatient side was strong across the board. Even in obstetrics, we saw births grow on a year-over-year basis. And that's been down a little bit, so very broad-based from a service line standpoint as well. 
 And then on the outpatient side, with the exception of outpatient surgery, and it's known to everybody that the calendar effects were not necessarily favorable, that influenced the outcomes on the outpatient surgery. But underneath our volumes on the outpatient surgery, as I mentioned, it was mostly Medicaid volume which we lost. 
 And we think again that's due to the redetermination process. A working theory that we have is that some of those patients have migrated to the exchange or to an employer. And with co-pays and deductibles, maybe those cases are actually deferred because of that for some period of time. We just don't know at this point. 
 But our overall profitability and revenue within our outpatient surgery business was up. So at the end of the day, the metric may look challenged, but the result was positive. So I would say that, as far as volumes, as we look toward the rest of the year, we do anticipate that the volume comparisons will be slightly more difficult. 
 But we expect, as I mentioned in my comments, that the demand for health care over the course of the year will continue to be strong, and we will be able to sustain growth. It may not be at this particular level, but we're pretty encouraged by where we are from an overall competitive positioning standpoint as well as what we see as the backdrop of demand. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho. 
Ann Hynes: So I know, I think, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how Medicaid redeterminations was having a negative impact on volumes. Can you just quantify what you think the impact was? And then secondly, do you think you had a revenue benefit from the two-midnight rule in the quarter? 
William Rutherford: Yes. Ann, this is Bill. It's hard to quantify. Regarding Medicaid redeterminations, we are doing our best to track that. We're seeing, just as we saw towards the end of last year, a large percentage of those people maintaining coverage, which I think is positive. Perhaps 20% of those we previously saw are not. And we're seeing a large portion of those end up in either HICS or employer-sponsored coverage. So we believe there is a small positive benefit here. And we're going to continue to monitor that over time on Medicaid redeterminations. 
 On the two-midnight rule, I'd say it's still early. We are starting to see some encouraging signs. We do believe it's providing a modest benefit. We're seeing some of our two-midnight inpatient volume grow. And we think that's due to statusing in accordance with the new rules. But I'll emphasize it's still early and not all claims have completed the adjudication processes. But at this point, we still believe there's going to be a modest benefit from the two-midnight rule. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. 
Pito Chickering: Can you talk about the OpEx pressure that you're seeing? Is there any else besides business expenses sort of going in there? And how should we think about OpEx as a percent of revenues using the first quarter as a launchpad? Does that continue to see pressure in 2Q? Does it level off at the back half of the year? And then any quantification of how Valesco is tracking better than expectations? 
William Rutherford: Yes, Pito, this is Bill. Let me start. So I think there's two primary factors that are influencing the year-over-year comparisons in other operating costs. I'll emphasize it's been very consistent over the past 3 quarters though. And I think, first, as you know and recall from others that we began to see the pro fee pressures mostly in the second quarter of last year. So we're still looking at some year-over-year effect of that. We're pleased that we're at least seeing the sequential growth in pro fees begin to moderate as we have for the past several quarters. 
 And I think the second contributor is just the expected increase in provider taxes related to the supplemental payment programs that we participate in. So those are really the two primary year-over-year contributors. And I think mostly, it was in line with our expectations. As we go forward, again I think for the past 3 quarters, the OpEx percent of revenue are relatively consistent and hopefully that will continue through the balance of the year. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. 
Benjamin Mayo: It looks like there's about almost $500 million of revenue that's not in the same-store segment this quarter. You did modest M&A this quarter, less than $100 million, you spent. I mean, is the entirety of the almost $500 million the campuses that you acquired last quarter? Anything I'm missing? I'm just trying to figure out maybe the impact on margins. Because if those don't really have any earnings, that could be maybe like a 60, 70 basis point drag. So if you could help me out there, Bill, that would be helpful. 
William Rutherford: Yes. Well, I think there's probably two. One, the Valesco operations would be in the non-same-store. And then we did acquire the Wise Health System in the last year. And that would be probably the other entity that's the difference between same-store and consolidated. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. 
Brian Tanquilut: Bill, thanks for all the help over the years, and congrats on the retirement again. Just my question on labor, you touched on Valesco a little bit. Any quantification you can share with us or expectation for further improvement both in Valesco and nurse staffing on temp labor? 
William Rutherford: Let me start with Valesco. So as we've said in our year-end call, we anticipate the Valesco operations to kind of generate the same amount that we had in '23. But in '23, we had them for 3 quarters. Obviously, we'll have them for 4 quarters in '24. So again, I think that's resulting in some sequential improvement. But I think that's still good guidance for us is to basically be flagged on a full year basis. 
 On the labor cost, we continue to be pleased with the trends in contract labor. The teams have a number of initiatives as we've seen. Turnover has stabilized, recruiting and hiring, still up. As I mentioned, our contract labor is down still 20% year-over-year. We think there's still more room to go as we go forward. So again, I think we're pleased, and we're again in a good position in overall labor trends. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. 
Benjamin Hendrix: Congratulations, Bill. Wanted to follow up on some of the mix commentary. You said you had some really strong commercial mix. I wanted to see kind of more detail on how exchange volume fits into that. I know you've talked about redetermination in Medicaid losses being offset, one pickup on exchange could offset three Medicaid losses. So just wondering kind of where we are on that recapture. And are we still on a lull? Or are we seeing enough exchange volume to kind of offset that? 
William Rutherford: Yes, Bill. Let me start with that one. We are very pleased with the mix. We're seeing our overall managed care increase in the 12%, 13% range. That is fueled by health insurance exchanges. Our exchange volume was up close to 50% in the first quarter. 
 The data we see, perhaps enrollment in our markets is up a little north of 30%. So our volume is a little higher than that. And I think that is probably attributable to redeterminations, at least a big chunk of that delta, as we are seeing some people who are redetermined off Medicaid landing in both employer-sponsored coverage as well as the HICS volume. 
 Remind you, it's still roughly 6% or so of our borrowing. But we have seen really good growth in that. And so we're pleased with that. Hard to tell where we are in that cycle. I think we may be there in the end, at least to the state's redetermination process. But we're very pleased with the trends we're seeing so far. 
 On the Medicaid redeterminations, as I said before, I think it has provided some benefit for us. We continue to track individuals that are presenting what their previous coverage was. And we're seeing the people who are being redetermined of landing in either employer-sponsored or HICS coverage. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Gary Taylor from TD Cowen. 
Gary Taylor: Bill, you'll be missed, so congrats. My two -- there were two numbers that really jumped out at me, so I just want to get your comment on those. The first is, I think, the occupancy number is all-time high you've reported or at least in the last decade. And I just want to think through, I mean, does that mean, I mean, we're peaking in terms of operating leverage on labor and other operating expense outside of professional fees? Could there still be more room on leverage? 
 And then the other would just be same-store ER visits is up 7% versus a plus 10% comp. And we had a similar phenomenon last year, where we're up huge against a very tough comp in the first quarter and then that kind of moderated. And I'm just trying to think through if there's anything around ER seasonality that's new with redeterminations or ACA, SEPs or anything that numbers like that brings to mind for you. 
Samuel Hazen: Gary, it's Sam. I think we're actually pretty pleased with the occupancy levels. When you look at our operating agenda, our operating agenda is making sure, number one, that we have the staffing supply necessary in order to accommodate what we believe to be again a positive demand backdrop. And we've made solid improvements over the last 18 months in recruitment, retention, enhanced care models that really create a better environment for our patients. 
 The second aspect to our capacity management and meeting the demand in the market is around our case management efforts. And our teams again have executed as normal inside of our company around whatever our imperatives are at a really high level. And we actually had acuity grow, as we mentioned, but length of stay went down. That allowed us to open up more beds, receive more patients in through our transfer centers and our emergency rooms and so forth. And that's not necessarily compromising our operating leverage. 
 1 quarter over 1 quarter is never a perfect proxy for the business. And so we're looking at the business sort of over a longer run. And with the exception of pro fees, which we believe will moderate over time, we will continue to see operating leverage in most scenarios when we have incremental volume because we have fixed cost in our labor platform, we have other fixed costs inside of our other operating expenses. So we are investing to add inpatient bed capacity. We had, I think, a little over 2% come online this year versus last year. We have a significant pipeline of capital that will help deliver more inpatient capacity over the next 2 to 2.5 years. So that's, that question. 
 On the emergency room, when you look at the emergency room and look underneath the emergency room, our commercial emergency room visits were up 20% on a year-over-year basis. That is a really strong metric. We're down 10% in Medicaid, up slightly in self-pay, which speaks to the point Bill was making around redeterminations, finding a different level within the mix of our business. And so our emergency room business, obviously, we had 1 extra day, so we see the same level of emergency room business inside of the leap year dynamic this year. So that would pull it back in normal quarters. But we're encouraged about what's going on in our emergency rooms. 
 We have a robust agenda there to revitalize the service levels because we've had a lot of dynamics coming out of COVID. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, our service levels have improved. The process time for a patient to be seen as well as the process time for a patient to be discharged or admitted to the floor has improved markedly. Our patient satisfaction continues to improve on a year-over-year basis in our emergency rooms and also on a sequential basis. 
 Additionally, we're investing in our emergency room platform both on-campus and off-campus. And those efforts are proving to be important to that particular service line as well. So the emergency room and our urgent care platform play a huge role in our overall network model. And we continue to be encouraged by what's going on in both areas. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. 
Justin Lake: Let me add my congrats to Bill on his retirement, really appreciate all your help over the years, bud. So my question was trying to get an update on your expectations for Medicaid, DPP and DSH. You reported the benefit here at $3.9 billion in 2023. I shouldn't say benefit, that's a gross number, I believe. 
 Appreciate the increased transparency, was hoping you could give us an update on what you're expecting for 2024 on this metric relative to 2023. Maybe how much of that -- that's a gross number again. How much should we think of as kind of the net benefit there? And then can you go back, if you have the number handy, to 2019, pre COVID, pre kind of the big increase in some of these programs and tell us what the number looked like back then? 
William Rutherford: Yes. Justin, let me try. And I think we'll have to get back to you on the '19, I don't have that upfront. But if I reflect back to our year-end discussion, that's still our belief today. First, just level set, these DPP programs are really fundamentally part of our Medicaid reimbursement. There's a lot of them. We have 18 or 19 states have these programs. But a lot of them have some complexity with a lot of variables associated. So use that as a backdrop.
 But we still believe when we look at the full year, there's going to be a modest headwind in the revenue to these programs, '24 versus '23, largely because of some settlements that we realized in '23, we do not expect to reoccur going forward. And so that's still our belief. In any 1 quarter, there may be factors that influence quarter-by-quarterly trends. But for the full year, we think there's still going to be a modest headwind on the revenue component that we have. 
 Each state has a little bit different in terms of whether they're tax-based or contribution-based. So there are clearly operating expenses associated with the revenue number that you quoted that we disclosed within our 10-K. But the ratios have remained relatively consistent. And we'll have to maybe get back to you on the '19 levels, I don't have that handy. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok from Barclays. 
Andrew Mok: I just wanted to echo congratulations to Bill. I just wanted to follow up on the comments you made on other OpEx. I think the year-over-year comparisons all make sense, given the timing of Valesco. But I'm still confused on the sequential progression from Q4. Because it sounds like Valesco performed better, physician fees moderated. 
 And it was my understanding that supplemental payments would actually step down a bit from elevated Q4 levels. So I'm just trying to understand why we didn't see a larger decrease or more leverage on the other OpEx line, given those trends. Is there something that we don't understand or some other unexpected kind of item in that other OpEx line? 
William Rutherford: No. I'd say we did have growth in our state supplemental payment expense quarter-by-quarter. As I said in Justin's response, there are certain variables that come on the timing of those. So sequentially, that was up. And the pro fees were up sequentially, it just was up small on there. 
 So those are the two main factors to call out in the other operating is pro fees and the state supplemental payment. And I think when you look at sequentially, it makes sense, pretty much the trends were in line with our expectations, but nothing else there that I'd highlight. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America. 
Kevin Fischbeck: So maybe two questions. I guess, one question, I guess, just about the guidance, I guess, there's been a lot of talk about how you guys are thinking about providing guidance. And you reaffirmed guidance in the quarter. I wasn't sure if that was trying to move away from providing an update every Q1 or whether that was -- you're actually reaffirming guidance because everything is exactly in line, so you're changing your communication around that without giving an update on that.
 But then second, just really about the volumes. Obviously, 3% to 4% volume for the year. You're above 5% to start. So does that imply that you're going to end the year more like 2%? And what we're seeing this year is 3% to 4%. How do you think about where volume will be in 2024 relative to that long-term trend line with the demand that you see in your markets? Are we maybe more or less back to that long-term trend line in 2024? Or is there still some room for that to kind of move up towards a longer-term trend line? 
William Rutherford: Kevin, this is Bill. Let me start and I'll ask Sam to add in. On the guidance, we typically would not adjust guidance in Q1 in normal years. But as we talked in our year-end call and as we've tried to set the guidance ranges, I believe the ranges are wide enough to accommodate a range of outcomes. And so we want to get out of the trend, if you will, of trying to reset guidance every quarter-by-quarter. 
 I think the long-term business trends that we've highlighted over the years and we highlighted in our Investor Day last year, we believe, are solid. They're kind of durable. And they've been pretty predictable over time. And our overall guidance is based on that. So we're not planning to adjust quarter-by-quarter unless there's material circumstances to warrant on either side of that.
 And on the volume trends, again, Sam can comment on here. As we've said, we're very pleased, very strong volume, very strong demand. And perhaps we do end up on the high side of our overall annual guidance. We'll remind you as we get into kind of the second half year-over-year comparisons, we started to see some volume -- positive volume trends in the third and fourth quarter last year. So the year-over-year comps will adjust a little bit. But we're very pleased where the volume trends are. And with these efforts, hopefully, we will end up on the high side. 
Samuel Hazen: Nothing else to add. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter, Wells Fargo. 
Stephen Baxter: Just to hopefully put a bow on the Medicaid state-directed payment question, can you just remind us, are we at the point now that you're accruing these evenly each quarter in 2024? Is there any lumpiness to kind of keep in mind about the first quarter or the rest of the year? 
 And then just to tie on to that, the final rule that got published earlier this week around this issue, do you feel optimistic that maybe more of your states kind of have more to do here? Or do you think maybe your states are doing a better job of proactively seeking these programs out? 
William Rutherford: Yes, let me. There is some variability in the timing of when we recognize these. For the most part, programs we've had under a while were on an accrual basis. With new programs, we would typically wait until we get some established history and actually funds starting to flow. So it's a little bit of a mix. But there is some variability that we see as we go year-by-year. Remind people, previous to this year, we were recognizing Florida on an annual lump sum basis. We started accruing. We started a little bit, but we tried to accrue those as much as we can as we got some historical practices.
 Relative to the rule that was released earlier this week, it's still early. We're working our way through the assessment. But generally, we review it as positive. It removes the potential for some [ capi add-on ] payments. And there's a potential for changes in terms of how providers receive payments. It will take a little bit of time for states to work through those and implement it. But generally, we view that as a positive development for us. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla from Citi. 
Jason Cassorla: I just want to follow up on labor. I know you're benefiting from reduced contract labor spend and the like. When we think about the first quarter SWB per just a patient day of about 3%, can you give us a sense of how wage growth trended in the quarter and then offsets on the productivity front that you're seeing and if there's anything within the first quarter that gives you confidence on your labor agenda kind of for the balance of the year? 
William Rutherford: Yes, I mean, obviously, as we've talked about over the past year, we've got a lot of initiatives on labor and our teams are executing very well from turnover reductions to recruitment and retention efforts on there. And our core labor trends are in line with our expectations. We said we anticipate wage inflation in that 2.5% to 3% level. And we're starting to -- and we are seeing that. And that's helping to offset, and we continue to be pleased with the contract labor trends. So I would say the core labor trends that we are seeing this year are right in line with our expectations. And the initiatives that we have continue to be underway. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes, Bernstein. 
Lance Wilkes: One follow-up on the labor question. And that's just if you could give any comment on hiring pipeline and if there are any categories where you're seeing either more appetite out there or any sort of constraints. And then my real question was on your comment on folks getting shifted over due to redeterminations and maybe that impacting outpatient surgeries. I was wondering if you're seeing any impacts of that sort of stuff on bad debt or any other things where perhaps the overall backdrop is impacting consumers here. 
William Rutherford: Yes, let me attempt on that. Relative to the pipeline of labor, I don't know if there's any specific things I'd call out. I mean, obviously, we have diversity of geography, diversity of different employer cohorts. And labor teams are doing a great job. Our nurse hiring is up. And so I don't think there's anything unique I would call on that. And Sam or others can add in on that.
 And relative to the redeterminations and perhaps that influencing our outpatient surgery, I think both the combination of the HICS volume growth that we spoke about earlier, some of that due to the Medicaid redetermination, it is just a working thesis that perhaps there's a little bit more sensitivity on some of those elective procedures early in the year relative to deductible and co-pays. As Sam mentioned in his comments, almost all of our drop in outpatient surgeries was in Medicaid and self-pay levels. So we'll need a little bit more time to see how that plays out. And perhaps there will be some rebound on that as that begins to kind of normalize throughout the year.
 And on your question relative to the impact of that on bad debts, we're saying, no, I can't say we've seen any impact on that right now. There's still some of our self-pay growth are individuals that are in what we call a pending Medicaid status as we're pursuing eligibility efforts on there. But it has not yet resulted in any material change in our collectibility or bad debts at this stage. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. 
Joshua Raskin: Bill, I'll also add my congrats, and thanks for all the help. My question is just on CapEx. Could you speak to the CapEx and sort of the deployment in the quarter. It was down a tiny bit, so let's call it flattish year-over-year, but generally been trending higher in recent years. I guess, maybe there's obviously a lot of timing. And then any new capacity specifically to call out in the next 12 months? I know you've got a bunch of projects over the next sort of 2 to 2.5 years as well. 
Samuel Hazen: This is Sam. The amount for the quarter is flattish, to your point. And it is timing. We haven't slowed anything down. Some of our construction projects move at different paces than we anticipate at some level. But we expect for the year to be somewhere close to the number that we guided to last quarter, which is somewhere around $5.2 billion or so. So we're investing more in the business than we've ever invested because of the capacity that we need in the network development that we want. And so those efforts continue as we go through the course of this year.
 As far as any particular capacity that I would call out, I would tell you we have a new hospital in San Antonio, Texas that will open up later this year on the west side of that community. We're excited about that. We have other major projects on a host of campuses that will come online over the year. I think our bed capacity, when we conclude the year, will be somewhere similar to the growth that we experienced this year, which is maybe another 2% or so. 
 As I mentioned previously, our emergency room capacity is also growing as we invest in new units or as we expand existing units. I don't have the number in front of me as to exactly how much we're anticipating there. But we're investing consistently as far as in the areas of our business. But we're investing more inside of those as a reflection of our overall spending.
 We also continue to invest in basic infrastructure in our facilities. Whether it's capabilities and technology for our nurses or surgical equipment and so forth, those investments continue again at elevated levels to improve the offerings for our physicians and patients. And so we have some increases embedded in that as well. So we're really excited about what we're spending our money on. And our patterns have proven that we can generate very positive returns. And we continue to believe that's the case. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Sarah James, Cantor Fitzgerald. 
Sarah James: I was wondering if you could give us what the commercial outpatient surgeries were. Just with the moving pieces, I think we're all just trying to understand if that piece was where you expected it to be. I know it's coming off of a tough comp last year. But was it still positive like it was the last few quarters? 
 And then Galen, I think, you guys are within a few weeks of your first graduating class. So just wondering strategically, how has that panned out? Did you get your share or better of the work commitments of the graduating class? 
Samuel Hazen: This is Sam. On the commercial side of outpatient surgery, I would say it's generally flat, so it performed better than the aggregate as a whole. Again, the calendar effects affected outpatient surgery in general. Specifically, it had a more dramatic effect on Medicaid, as we mentioned. But we aren't anticipating or seeing anything that's structural with our outpatient surgery business. And as I just mentioned, our capital spending has investments in our outpatient surgery platform as well.
 With respect to Galen, we have had graduating classes in the past. We continue to have larger ones as we expand that component of our organization. And one of our priorities within our facilities and within our nursing agenda is to integrate the Galen campuses into sort of the organization more effectively. And we are seeing incremental improvement in retaining those graduates within our company. And we continue to see opportunities for improvement there. It's really early to say it's completely solidified. We have numerous campuses that are in early stages of development. 
 We will have again somewhere around 30 campuses by the end of 2027 with roughly 30,000 students across those campuses graduating somewhere between 7,000 or 8,000 per year, allowing us to pipeline and hopefully create a really good student experience, integrate them into the system through clinical integration and retain them when they graduate. So that's our strategy. And we're still early in seeing the effects of that. But we're encouraged by the efforts. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Cal Sternick from JPMorgan. 
Calvin Sternick: We've heard commentary from some others that January and February were strong from a volume perspective with some softening of demand in March. Can you talk about what you saw in the quarter? And then if you're seeing the expected rebound volumes into April? 
 And if I could also just ask one clarification on the Medicaid supplemental payments, do you have any visibility right now into any retro programs that could come through in the second quarter? 
William Rutherford: This is Bill, I'll answer the last one. No, we don't have specific visibility. There's always timing differences of certain aspects, but no specific visibility, no. 
Samuel Hazen: As far as the volumes, every quarter has calendar effects. And again, as I mentioned previously, we judge the business over a longer period of time to really understand what's working and what's not working. March was a difficult calendar for purposes of elective outpatient business and elective inpatient business simply because we had less working days, business days, and we had the Easter holidays during that time period. So it was clearly softer.
 We actually grew our inpatient admissions, however, in March. But our outpatient activity was soft and influenced sort of the aggregate for the quarter. We don't give guidance with respect to 1 month into the next quarter. I will tell you, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, that we're encouraged by the overall backdrop of demand in our markets. 
Operator: And this concludes our Q&A session for today. And I would like to turn the call back over to Frank Morgan for closing remarks. 
Frank Morgan: Wally, thank you for your help today, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. We hope you have a nice weekend. I'm around this afternoon if you have additional questions. Give us a call. Have a good day. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Enjoy the rest of your day. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.
Frank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: All right. Good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining the call. We finished 2023 better than expected across most dimensions of our business. In the quarter, we experienced strong demand for services across our diversified portfolio of markets, facilities and service lines. This growth, coupled with improved cost trends drove solid financial performance in the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales were $5.90, which represented a 27% increase over prior year. We are encouraged by these results and believe the operational momentum we have created should position us well for 2024. As mentioned at our recent Investor Day, the staying power of HCA Healthcare was on display again throughout the year. Diluted earnings per share excluding gains and losses on sales and debt retirement for the year grew almost 13% as compared to 2022. As a management team, we pride ourselves on the following: first, owning our realities, whatever they are; next, making a big company small so we can adjust timely; and third, being disciplined in thought, resource allocation and execution, helping us to accomplish our mission. Once again, I believe our people have impressively demonstrated these traits in the face of new challenges and delivered positive outcomes for our patients, the communities we serve and our other stakeholders. I often refer to them as can do people. And again, this past year, I think they proved it. I want to thank them for their hard work and everything they do for our company. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong in the fourth quarter. Admissions grew 3% year-over-year. Equivalent admissions were up 4%, emergency room visits grew 2%. Inpatient and outpatient surgery volumes increased approximately 1%. Most of our other volume categories, including cardiac procedures and rehab admissions had solid growth metrics in the quarter also. All domestic divisions had equivalent admissions growth in the quarter. Additionally, payer mix and acuity levels in the quarter improved year-over-year. These factors, along with certain enhancements in a couple of states' Medicaid supplemental programs helped produce same facilities revenue growth of 11% in the quarter. Bill will provide more detail on revenue in his comments. Operating margins improved in the quarter as we were able to generate solid operating leverage across the company on the increased revenue we produced as compared to the prior year, but even more impressively when compared sequentially to the third quarter. We executed well over the year on our people agenda. In the quarter, we saw further progress on key metrics as evidenced by solid employee engagement results, stable turnover trends and reductions in contract labor utilization. As we have detailed in the past, we have implemented a comprehensive human resources plan. We expect to make further progress on it as we move into 2024. Our plan will remain a top organizational priority with significant investments in workforce development and trainings, which includes expansions in both Galen College of Nursing and our centers for clinical advancement. With respect to hospital-based physician costs in the quarter, we slowed the rate of growth. As it pertains to Valesco, our physician staffing joint venture, we reduced the operating loss in the fourth quarter, more in line with our expectations. As indicated at our Investor Day, we expect to invest significantly this year in our long-term plans, which we designed to take our company from strength to strength and achieve the growth potential we see in our core business. These investments revolve around three distinct opportunities. The first one includes continued network expansion in facilities, services and workforce to meet the demand growth that we expect in our markets while also supporting our efforts to increase market share. In 2024, we have over $2 billion of new capital projects scheduled to come online that will increase capacities. Additionally, we expect to integrate a number of newly acquired hospitals and outpatient facilities that should complement our networks. The second opportunity includes a robust agenda designed to advance digital capabilities across the company and unlock the embedded value we see in our operations. As high performing as we are today, we believe there is more operational potential inside our company with evolving technological tools we are investing to unlock this value. We believe this initiative, together with our care transformation and innovation program will enhance quality, drive further efficiencies through our financial resiliency program and improve overall operational management capabilities, including integrating our revenue cycle and case management functions better. The third area of opportunity pertains to the flexibility we have to use our balance sheet position and strong cash flow production to invest heavily in our business and in our people while also allocating capital to our shareholders. In 2024, we plan to increase capital spending to over $5 billion and enhance our share repurchase program to around $5 billion. We continue to believe this strategic plan will produce more winning play for our organization, allowing us to deliver better services for patients while also creating value for other stakeholders. Let me close with this, the constants in our organization consists of three principles: giving our patients what they deserve whenever they need services, partnering with our physicians to deliver high-quality outcomes and leveraging the distinct elements of HCA Healthcare to improve performance. Our approach to delivering on these core values comes from what we term the HCA way. That is supporting our local provider systems with value-added enterprise-level capabilities coupled with disciplined and detailed oriented management teams that relentlessly focus on execution. This operating philosophy has helped us navigate different economic cycles, adapt to changes in the industry and address challenges such as the COVID pandemic. As we look to the future, we have designed our next-generation growth plan to build upon the strengths we have developed over the years and take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. I am proud of HCA Healthcare and I'm even more proud of our people. We will move into 2024 in the years ahead with greater purpose with a renewed agenda to drive sustained growth and with confidence in our ability to deliver value and positive outcomes for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call to Bill, and he will discuss in more detail the quarter's results and 2024 guidance.
Bill Rutherford: Okay, great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter and year and then discuss our 2024 guidance. We highlighted at our recent Investor Day that our formula of combining strong operational performance with a disciplined and balanced allocation of capital has a long track record of generating value over time. Our results for 2023 and our guidance for 2024 reflect a continuation of this formula. Sam provided many of our fourth quarter indicators in his comments. So let me take a moment to review some of our results for the full year 2023. We have strong top line growth. For the year, our same facility admissions grew 3.3% over prior year, equivalent admissions grew 4.8%, emergency room business grew 4.7% and total surgical cases were up 2.3%. We maintained our strong acuity trends with case mix index increasing and payer mix improved with managed care and other admissions growing 6% for the full year on a same-facility basis. Revenue per equivalent admission grew 2.7% on a same facility basis. This contributed to same-facility revenue growing 7.6% and 7.9% on a consolidated basis for the full year 2023. We coupled top line strength with strong management of operating costs. Salaries, wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points on a consolidated basis compared to prior year. Contract labor declined 20% for the year and equated to 5.3% of those SMEB in the fourth quarter. Our teams continue to do a great job managing the supply costs, which improved 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue for the full year. As we have mentioned throughout the year, we are managing through pressures on professional fees and hospital-based physician costs. But we saw an improvement in the sequential rate of growth in both the third and fourth quarter. Sam mentioned, we also saw an improvement in our Valesco joint venture, which was in line with our expectations. We are confident in our plans to continue working through what we believe are industry-wide pressures in this area. The result of this is we produced solid margins of 19.6% in line with our range of expectations on a consolidated basis and adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.5% on an as reported basis for the full year 2023. So as a management team, we are very pleased with the operational performance of the company during the year. Let me briefly discuss our results in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew just under 14% in the quarter as compared to the prior year. This is primarily due to strong revenue growth and solid expense management during the quarter. In addition to our strong core business trends, we recognized a year-over-year adjusted EBITDA increase of approximately $250 million related to our supplemental payment programs. This includes the new North Carolina program and certain favorable adjustments within the Texas program. Additionally, based on our experience with the program to date, we began accruing the Florida program in the quarter, whereas previously, we had recognized this program on an annual lump sum basis. Our recently acquired entities, as well as facilities divested in the prior year, resulted in about $90 million less adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, with roughly half of this decline from the Valesco joint venture. In summary, the quarter was the strongest operational performance of the year. And with the additional benefit from the supplemental programs and impact of new and divested facilities, we are very pleased with the year-over-year growth we were able to produce. So next let me speak to capital allocation. We deployed a balanced allocation of capital in 2023. For the full year, our cash flow from operations was $9.4 billion compared to $8.5 billion in the prior year or just under 11% growth. Capital expenditures were just above $4.7 billion for the year, which was in line with our expectations. We purchased approximately $3.8 billion of our outstanding shares and paid approximately $660 million of dividends during the year. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage remains near the low end of our stated guidance range of three to four times, so we believe we are well positioned going into 2024. And with that, let me speak to our 2024 guidance for a moment. As noted in our release this morning, we are providing full year 2024 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $67.75 billion and $70.25 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $5.2 billion and $5.6 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.85 billion and $13.55 billion. And expect diluted earnings per share to range between $19.70 and $21.20. And finally, we expect capital spending to range between $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion. So let me provide a little additional commentary on our guidance. First, let me note the $145 million payer settlement we reported in the first quarter of 2023. Our guidance assumes a growth in equivalent admissions between 3% and 4% and revenue per equivalent admission between 2% and 3%. Regarding state supplemental programs, I want to highlight that these programs are complex and most have multiple attributes that impact the timing and amounts we receive. So this results in some variability of the timing of recognizing the impact of these programs during the year. For 2024, we are anticipating benefit from a new program in Nevada. But based on current assumptions, we expect some modest headwinds when we aggregate the impact of all of these supplemental programs and we believe this could range between $100 million and $200 million for the year. We expect full year margins to be within our historical trends, and cash flow from operations to range between $9.5 billion and $10 billion. Depreciation is estimated to be about $3.2 billion. And interest expense is projected to be around $2 billion. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be around 264 million for the year. Also noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program. This will be in addition to the approximately $300 million remaining on our prior authorization. In addition, our Board declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.60 to $0.66 per share. With that, let me turn the call back over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: All right, thank you, Bill. As you saw in our press release, Bill Rutherford has decided to retire after 34 years with the company, 10 years as CFO, and Bill had a tremendous career with HCA. And then in my communication to our colleagues throughout the company I indicated that is impressive as the results were financially with the company during his tenure. Bill's legacy with the company will be remembered by the many people in the company has positively impacted with his leadership, mentorship and the way he embraced our mission and culture. And so Bill, congratulations on your retirement, and thank you very much on behalf of the Board and the senior team for everything you've done for the organization. Now part of Bill’s legacy is creating a really deep financial team inside our organization. We pride ourselves on having the capabilities to build talent and then replace talent and we are fortunate to have Mike Marks as our next CFO. Mike has been with the company for 28 years. He has had various roles most of which were in the National Group as the Group’s CFO for the National Group for 10 years, and then he has been in the Senior Vice President and Financial Operations role for the last few years. He is a proven HCA executive, he understands and appreciates our culture, he knows how to execute and get results and I know he's going to be an exceptional CFO for HCA. And I am eager for many of you to get to meet him. So Mike, congratulations. So with that Frank, we will go into questions.
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Sam. And thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so we might give as many as possible in the queue, an opportunity to ask a question. Greg, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.
Operator: All right, thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] Okay, it looks like our first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS. Caller please go ahead. 
A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Best wishes Bill, on the retirement and congratulations to Mike. I just want to ask about volumes because there is obviously some different chatter out there about what's going on. I think coming into the fourth quarter, you guys had said you expected to see a return to normal seasonality. I wonder whether that's what you described, what you saw there? Do you have any updated thoughts on whether we’re seeing a sicker population post-COVID maybe just some pent-up demand for people going back to see the doctors? And then specifically as well on utilization review management, we've talked about that from time to time that health plans are getting more aggressive post-pandemic now about utilization review. There is also a chatter in the last week about maybe there is actually easing around observation status. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit of what you're seeing in that category as well.
Sam Hazen: Well, let's see, A.J., this is Sam, there is about four questions there. Let me see if I can sort of emphasize them. I will tell you from our judgment we had normal seasonality with respect to most categories of our business. And we had indicated last year that we thought seasonality trends have returned in the latter half of 2022 and they continued in our estimation into the latter half of 2023, with the natural seasonality that we see in our outpatient areas as well as some of our other surgical areas for the most part from the third quarter of this year to the fourth quarter. How that was influenced by new policies and pent-up demand, we can't really determine that, and we don't believe it had a material impact. So from our standpoint, we've been optimistic that our strategy around our network development, our execution on our quality and patient safety agenda, and then our partnerships with our physicians was going to allow us to continue to grow. We mentioned that at our Investor Day. And we think that's part and parcel to what's happening with our business as we push through the latter part of the year. I mean there is always utilization of policies and procedures coming from the payers. There is, like I said, some changes in certain policies. It's way too early judge the effect of those and we are really judging our business and thinking about 2024 optimistically around where the demand for health care is at least in our markets.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Caller, please go ahead.
Pito Chickering:
s :
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Pito, let me put it this way, I can't give you all that detail right now. As we've talked about, we view supplemental payments is really just part of our overall Medicaid revenue portfolio. I think we're up to 17 or 18 states with supplemental payment programs right now. As I mentioned in my comments, each of these programs have a level of complexity and multiple attributes to it that affect the timing of when we recognize those. In the quarter, as I mentioned, we did recognize the benefit of the new North Carolina program that was anticipated. We had settlement in Texas, and we began accruing Florida accounts for it. So we can maybe offline give you a quarter-by-quarter breakdown. But those were the main things that affected us during the fourth quarter. But I will mention even with the supplemental payment programs, the core operations of the business remains strong. When we look at core revenue growth as well as our revenue per unit growth, we believe the supplemental payments were just additive to what was already a strong quarter.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Justin go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks guys. And I will start off by adding my thanks to Bill, I appreciate all the help over the years, and you will be missed and congrats to Mike. My question was around Medicare specifically and a couple of things. One, you talked about commercial being strong. We've been hearing Medicare Advantage trends have been specifically really strong in the quarter. Can you give us some color on Medicare revenue growth and Medicare volume growth in the quarter? And then specifically, I think in reference to A.J.’s question, I think we’re just try to touch on was the impact of the two-midnight rule. Can you talk about what’s going on there for 2024? And what you think the impact might be? And did you see any early benefits in 2023 as it started ramping up into this? Thanks a lot.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Justin, thanks for that. Let’s start with the Medicare volume, as I know that’s been a topic. We have seen some growth in our Medicare Advantage admissions, which were roughly up 10% in the quarter, which is pretty consistent for what we’ve seen throughout the year. And we think probably a combination of conversion from traditional Medicare fee-for-service as well as some of our volume gains and maybe a bit utilization. It’s hard for us to break that down in its entirety on there in terms of our revenue per unit between Medicare Advantage and Medicare has been very consistent through the year as well. So we didn’t see any really step change in the fourth quarter of that material amount. When I think about the two-midnight rule Sam alluded it’s too early for us to judge the impact of this rule. We know it’s got a period to be implemented. We believe ultimately it’s going to benefit our patients. And we think over time could be some moderate positive results for us, but we’ve seen no impact yet. But we believe over time, as we go through 2024, there could be some modest benefits we’ll go through that.
Operator: Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Ben, go ahead.
Ben Hendrix: Hey, thank you very much, and congratulations to Bill and Mike. Just wanted to follow-up on your comment about the $5 billion of capital spending you expect. Just wanted to get an idea of how you’re thinking about allocating that into your inpatient capabilities and higher acuity. And where you think – where do you think – how should we think about that evolving through the year and the impact on case mix as we look into your 2024 guidance? Thank you.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. We have been pretty consistent with our allocation over the years between inpatient, outpatient and technology, and I think 2024 will be somewhat consistent with that. I will tell you we do have a large development pipeline of new outpatient facilities that are connected to our capital project in 2024 and 2025. We’ll have quite a few come online, little bit more than we had in 2023 and 2022. We do have some new hospitals in a few markets that will come online, and we’re starting to invest in, in other markets. So I think when we look at the volume of beds and so forth coming on in 2024, it’s about the same as 2023, if I remember correctly. And then our ER capacity is growing consistently. So we’re pretty consistent in our allocation of capital. It’s not disproportionately oriented to any one category of our business. And we think, again, that approach has yielded really strong returns. It’s allowed us to meet the demand expectations that exist in the market, and it’s also responded to our physicians in a way that created the capacity or allowed for the clinical technology that they need to practice their medicine. So we’re stepping it up because we have a growing occupancy on the inpatient side, and then we have opportunities in the outpatient side to expand our networks further in these fast growing communities. That’s pretty much the snapshot of it, but it’s generally consistent from an allocation standpoint to prior years.
Operator: Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with TD Cowen. Gary, please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. One clarification and then I’ll ask my real question. I just want to make sure I understood what Bill said, and congrats to Bill, by the way.
Bill Rutherford: Thanks.
Gary Taylor: You were walking through the net Medicaid, DPP, EBITDA, outlook for 2024. And I think you said overall you’re expecting that dollars to come down $100 million to $200 million. I want to make sure I heard that correct. And then my real question was just, you talked about stemming the Valesco operating losses sequentially to more in line with what you originally thought, which I think means maybe brings that down to sort of breakeven in the quarter. And I was just hoping you’d share with us a little bit about how operationally you pulled that off.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Gary, this is Bill. Thanks for those comments. Let’s start with DPP. You are correct in my comments. We are expecting overall, when we aggregate all the programs to potentially be a headwind, anywhere between $100 million and $200 million, largely due to settlements that we received this year, we don’t expect to reoccur. And then the Florida beginning accrual had an impact to that. So that’s what’s mostly driving that across our multiple programs. On Valesco, as we mentioned, it came in line with our expectations, which I think last quarter we sized just under $50 million or so a quarter. As we continue to work on multiple improvement initiatives, including further integrating that joint venture into HCA, we expect to see continued improvement going forward. Next year I think Valesco for the full year will equate with about the same amount we recorded this year, but we had nine months this year versus 12 months, obviously in 2024. So we do believe over time there will be continued improvement, and we’re working diligently towards those efforts.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian, please go ahead.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, and Bill, congrats and very successful career at HCA. I guess my question to follow-up on Gary’s, maybe expanding it further to the broader labor outlook. How are you thinking about the opportunity to further reduce spending on both nursing and obviously at Valesco? Or maybe another way to ask it is how are you viewing inflation at the wage level? Thank you.
Bill Rutherford: Well, I think we’ve proven the teams have managed through that very well during the inflationary period we experienced. I think going forward we expect to move back into kind of the normal trends, which is generally 2.5% to 3% of wage inflation going for us. And then we believe there’s continued improvement in contract labor to be achieved, and we have plans to execute that throughout 2024. On the professional fees in Valesco, we have a number of initiatives with teams working on that to not only further integrate into our operations, but to continue to figure out adjustments to those programs. Our professional fees I’ve talked to, we have seen a decline in the sequential rate of growth. So we’re a bit encouraged with that as we go into 2024. We would expect those sequential declines to continue. And we’re working hard through multiple initiatives, whether it would be revenue enhancements, program adjustments, or looking at opportunities to internalize some of those programs.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Ann, please go ahead.
Ann Hynes: Good morning. Thank you. And I also want to congratulate Bill on his retirement. I just have a couple of follow-ups just on the managed care pricing yield assumptions for 2024, which is up 2% to 3%, which looks a little conservative given the two-midnight rule. And when you look at Medicaid redeterminations, the growth in the health exchange in your states are very strong. So in your guidance, do you embed any benefit from the two-midnight rule or kind of the shift from Medicaid potentially to commercial? And then secondly, if you can just maybe give us some more detail about how the two-midnight rule could impact you, maybe a percent of emissions or maybe kind of a differential between revenue per emit would be great. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Ann, this is Bill. Let me first clarify our 2% to 3% emission our aggregated revenue per equivalent emission, and then obviously there’s categories underneath it. I would tell you regarding Medicaid redetermination still early. We believe there’s some modest benefit that we’ve seen as patients have migrated from Medicaid into Hicks [ph] and other employer sponsor. I don’t believe that’s material yet. We’ll see how that continues to trend throughout 2024. And I would say we don’t have a material fact – material amount factored into our guidance on that. On the two-midnight rule, as we said earlier, it is really early in that progression. It should be positive for us if it’s implemented as expected. I think it will be positive for patients over time as well, and we’ll just have to see how that plays out. But we don’t have, I’d say, a material adjustment factored into our 2024 numbers for that as well. Our range of guidance, I think accommodates for various outcomes on both of those programs, and we’ll see how that plays out as we go through the first part of the year.
Operator: Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners. Whit, please go ahead.
Whit Mayo: Thanks, and congrats to Bill. I think this might be the second time you’ve retired, so I hope it sticks. But my question really, Sam is I’m curious on any new expense initiatives that you guys have elevated internally as a new strategic focus, anything maybe more creative or imaginative that you’re bringing forth this year to challenge the organization? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Well, at our Investor Day, Mike Marks presented our financial resiliency program, and it’s got different components to it. There’s more sophisticated integration of our revenue cycle that includes our case management initiative, which I will highlight here. Our case management initiative is to make sure that our patients get into the right setting in the right timeline and free up capacity where appropriate, and so forth. This past year, we had early stage success with that. Our length of stay was down and our case mix was modestly up. So when you put the two together, it's a good start for us with respect to our case management initiative. That is important on multiple fronts. It allows us to allocate our nurse staffing more effectively to more acute patients and so forth. We will continue to invest in that initiative as we bring on more technology, more structure to our teams, and better process and benchmarking. The second thing I would highlight is with respect to what we're calling our internal benchmarking initiative, we have incredible opportunities to compare more deeply into our organization, whether it's on the variable cost side, with respect to what we allocate and distribute to our facilities or on fixed costs. And both of those categories are getting a lot more benchmarking under Mike's leadership and we're finding opportunities to rethink how we organize our cost structure, how we leverage process improvement, how we use technology and automation in those areas to improve processes and variable costs. So I'm excited about the prospects there. As I mentioned in my commentary, we had a very successful transition from the third quarter to the fourth quarter with respect to what we call clearance, operating leverage. And our operating leverage from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was the best I'd seen in my experiences with the company. And I think part of that, not all of that, is due to some of these initiatives and the transparency we have around our efforts to improve efficiencies, improve clinical outcomes for our patients and so forth. So those are two things I would highlight. Obviously, our technology agenda and our care transformation is a longer run effort with respect to improved outcomes across different dimensions of our business. And we've had some modest success there in the short run, but we're really banking on those programs giving us long-term value. So those are just a couple of highlights.  Whit, I will tell you, our teams, culturally, are disciplined, and as I mentioned, that discipline creates opportunities for us to find better ways to do things for all of our stakeholders. And that mindset is something that we carry forward from one year to the next, and we'll carry that on into 2024, on into 2025 and so forth. And we think it's an essential ingredient for a health system success. And I'm pretty proud of our teams and how they embrace that and how they execute on the initiatives to make that happen.
Operator: Thanks, Whit. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Kevin, please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. And I'll just add my thanks to Bill for your help over the years. I guess, wanted to know, I get a little more color from you guys about the volume expectation for 2024, because you guys know we talk about two to three. It looks like you're looking for faster growth in 2024. So I just wanted to better understand where that extra growth is coming from. So any color around the service lines or procedures that you think still have room to grow above average. And if there's anything that you expect from a payer mix perspective in 2024, is there one type of payer where you think there's a big opportunity for volumes to snap back? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Kevin, let me start and then Sam can add in. So we're going off our experience, we've seen throughout 2023. And as we said earlier in the comments, we thought there was very strong demand for services in our markets. We think our capital programs and our program initiatives are paying off. Our adjusted emissions this year were 4.8%. You're right. Our guidance next year calls us for three to four expectation on adjusted emissions. That may be a little higher than our two to three historical, but I think we're reading continued strong demand. We saw really strong enrollment in the health insurance exchanges across our states, and that continues to be a favorable development for us. We believe we continue to see strong economic indicators and employments and our access to contract and lives remain well. So I think all of those factors go into play with our expectations for 2024 and is based on kind of our current experience.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Stephen, please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter: Yes, hi. Thanks. And congrats to Bill as well. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about surgical growth in the quarter, whether there's any notable puts or takes there by service line or inpatient versus outpatient. And then I guess the overall growth slowed down a little bit as we got to the back half of the year. I guess, how are you thinking about surgical growth in 2024 and especially coming up against maybe some of the tougher comparisons that you'll have in the first half of the year? Thank you.
Bill Rutherford: So overall, the fourth quarter surgery was a little slower than the year-to-date, and we were talking about that earlier this morning, we did have a more difficult December calendar, even though, we had the same surgical days in total. The way they were allocated created some challenges in our outpatient settings. And we saw outpatient activity not as strong as in the previous two months of the quarter, but at a structural level, there's nothing to suggest that our surgical volume trends are going to change. For the year, we had really solid volume growth in surgeries, and we continue to invest heavily in our programs, both on the outpatient side and supporting our inpatient activity with more acute and complex program offerings. And for the year, our inpatient surgeries were up two and our outpatient surgeries were up 2.5. So a slight migration, if you will, into the outpatient setting. And we think that will be generally consistent as we push into 2024, we do have a number of ambulatory surgery centers that have opened or will open in 2024. We've made a few acquisitions in certain markets with ambulatory surgery centers, and we continue to invest in our hospital operating suites as well as improve our processes just as we are improving our emergency room processes with our revitalization program. And we think that will continue to be a value add for our patients and for our physicians and help us with our volume pursuits. So that's how we're judging the surgical space. If you look at cardiac underneath that, our cardiac volumes continue to grow very robust and are actually growing in the mid-single digits. And we think, again, that's reflective of our overall program development, expansion into new service lines underneath cardiac and responding again to our patient needs and physician needs in ways that we believe are productive for our organization.
Operator: Excellent. Our next caller – excuse me. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla with Citi Group. Jason, please go ahead.
Jason Cassorla: Yes, great. Thanks for taking my question and best of luck in your retirement, Bill. I just wanted to follow-up on the professional fee environment. You noted there was some deceleration in professional fee spent growth, if I heard that correctly. But maybe what is your expectation for physician costs or professional fees growth embedded within 2024 guidance. And then on Valesco, it sounds like from your comments, Bill, that Valesco would generate $150 million of negative EBITDA next year versus the $200 million or so headwind for 2023. Is that a fair way to look at it or any other color that would be great? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Let me add in and thanks for that. I think Valesco is a little lower. We're about $150 million of both years, but obviously in 2023, we add a nine months versus 12 months next year. So we see a kind of run rate improvement as we go through the quarters during the year. On pro fees, we, as we said, have seen a decline in the sequential rate of growth. We have multiple initiatives underway embedded in our guidance next year is holding that professional fee growth perhaps to 8% to 10% versus this year where it's been closer to 15% to 20%. So we are looking for a step change and we're confident in our initiatives and the activities we have to be able to begin to bend that trend line.
Operator: Great. Thanks, Jason. And our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Scott, please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. And I'll echo my congrats to Bill. And then my question is, would be curious in terms of how you're thinking about the whole broader debate on just the pent up demand recovery in the seniors population. And based on all your data and analysis, sort of where you think the Medicare utilization trends are now at this point relative to sort of pre-pandemic levels and returning to the baseline, certainly, felt like there was some quite a bit of that recovery played out in 2023, but interested in sort of what inning you think we may be in that process at this point. Thanks.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. It's interesting. I'm just looking at a trend line here, and I don't have it beyond this time period. But in 2019, this is a composite view of Medicare. So it has both Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Our Medicare admissions grew 2.6%. You throw out 2020 and 2021 grew 2.1%, 2022 grew 3.4% and 2023 grew 4%. So is there acceleration on our trend? Yes. Obviously, there's aging baby boomers in the mix there, number one. Number two, we think we're taking out market share, so to judge overall utilization patterns around that is really difficult for us. There's population growth in our markets. When you look at adjusted admissions on the same combination payer class, again: 3.7% in 2019, 5.3% at 2021, 4.7% in 2022 and 5.7% in 2023. So a slight acceleration, but a function we believe of aging baby boomers and a number of beneficiaries moving in the program, population growth for us in market share gains. So it's hard for us to judge underneath that, whether or not there's some structural change in utilization, that's almost impossible for us to discern with the data that we have.
Operator: Great. Thank you, Scott. And our next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Sarah, please go ahead.
Sarah James: Congratulations on the retirement, Bill.
Bill Rutherford: Thanks.
Sarah James: You guys said that the impact of the two-midnight rule ramps through the year. So it ramp as opposed to flipping a switch, what are the mechanics of that stage implementation? Is it retaining your staff? Or is it assuming some delay in benefit from claims denials and getting the payers on board? And then when would it be fully ramped? Are you talking midyear exiting 2024? And is there anything that HCA can do to pull that forward?
Bill Rutherford: Well, I mean, the rule goes in effect in January. So I think the impact may ramp over time. It's a notable change for the payers. So we're working them very closely on the administration of those plans and making sure it's operating as described on there. And if it does, we should see it equally throughout the year. And so we're working closely on it, but it's a pretty big change for the payers. And so there might be some administrative differences as it gets implemented through the year. But we hope very quickly, we'll be able to work our way through that and begin to see some benefit as we go through 2024.
Operator: Thanks, Sarah. And our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Lance, please go ahead.
Lance Wilkes: Great and congratulations to both Bill and Mike. Can you talk a little bit about labor supply that you're seeing? First, in the past a couple of quarters ago, I talked about like demand that have been turned away at the hospitals; if you could just note if there's still any of that? And then how kind of hiring pipelines and are there particular areas that are more plentiful or areas that might be bottlenecks? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam again. Thank you for the question. We finished the year roughly. I don't have the exact average here at 90% acceptance rate. In other words we weren't able to take roughly 10% of the patients who were referred to us through our transfer centers and such. That improved throughout the year as we went from maybe the mid- to high- in the first part of the year, to a little better than that in the second half of the year. We're still below where we were in 2019. But what we have seen is more patients coming through our transfer centers and other patient navigation program that we did in 2019. So we feel good about the inflow if you will. We are still at times in situations where all of our capacity is not open and available, and that's what generates these situations where we can't receive the patients that are coming through these navigation programs and transfer centers. We think that will continue to get better in 2024 as we have capital coming online, as our hiring patterns continue to improve. Our turnover as I mentioned in my commentary has also improved. We've been very intentional in trying to create a great environment for our people with good leadership; resource capabilities and just overall trading to support the efforts so that they can be successful in what they do. And we think that will help us push through 2024 and hopefully have more capacity available and be able to receive the patients that want to get into our system.
Operator: Great. Thanks, Lance. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Josh, please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'll thank Bill and congratulate him on the retirement, and congrats to Mike as well. Could you speak to the increase in CapEx guidance again, this has been a multiyear trend for guidance? And maybe how returns on CapEx have trended? I'm just curious if there's more mix to outpatient, is that actually improving returns or are you getting to a point where the returns are coming in a little bit lower for the incremental project as you sort of continue to go down the list? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Josh, this is Bill. I'll start on the returns. Our returns remain very solid. I mean, we're in the upper teens returns. We have a very disciplined process where we evaluate these projects and we actually do look backs to validate some of our assumptions. And to me the growth in the capital spending is a reflection of the growth of the opportunities we see to deploy capital to continue that growth. So we're very pleased with the returns on those. I think as Sam mentioned earlier in the Q&A, the mix between inpatient and outpatient, it varies from time to time, but mostly similar. We do have some newer outpatient facilities coming on. They generally have very good returns and quick returns when they do come online. So I think the capital program, we're pleased with; it's an important component to our growth formula, as we've talked about, and we're pleased with the overall returns in the interview.
Sam Hazen: Yes. And the only thing I would say, and Bill alluded to this, our outpatient platform tends to be short cycle returns. We get a real efficient sort of capital allocation with outpatient facilities. And then on the hospital side, we are a hospital-centric health system. And as we invest in our hospitals, those are long-lived assets and they have a longer cycle to them with respect to returns, but they're critically important to the overall value that our outpatient facilities can generate for our system in the sense that we're able to navigate the patient further into the health care system if they need more acute care offerings. So we have to look at it in both manners. I think to Bill's point, we have had strong returns, a pattern of strong returns, we have occupancy on our inpatient hospital side in the low-70% which is a pretty high occupancy level up over where it was pre-pandemic even with the additional beds that we've added. So we think the network model that we highlighted for you all at the Investor Day is working and is complemented by the outpatient facilities integrated with the hospital system in a manner that produces really positive enterprise returns for our company.
Operator: Great. Thanks, Josh. And our final question comes from the line of Cal Sternick with JPMorgan. Cal, please go ahead.
Cal Sternick: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in, and I'll add my congratulations to Bill as well. So two follow-ups. First, on the redeterminations, it sounds like that's a slight benefit to the 2024 guide but not really material yet. Just wanted to clarify if this does develop better than you're anticipating? Is it something you think could be material to 2024? Or is the upside more annualized in 2025 after the redeterminations are completed? And then my other question was on the quarter itself. So one of the payers called out higher COVID inpatient costs per case. Can you talk about the COVID acuity levels that you saw in the quarter and whether that developed consistently with what you've seen in the past?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. This is Bill. Let me start with the Medicaid redetermination. I think you're characteristic is right, we do see some modest benefit in 2024. We haven't adjusted to be material yet, but our range of guidance allows for some outcomes on there. We started to see some of the effects of those redeterminations late in 2023. We're tracking those very closely. We're seeing roughly 30% to 35% of those individuals that were potentially on Medicaid seem to show up with either HICS or employer-sponsored coverage, so that there's some benefit in that. We're seeing a decently large number being able to be reapplied into Medicaid because some were redetermined off for technical reasons. So we've been able to manage through that. And I think with the conversion into HICS or employer-sponsored, there is some modest benefit as we go through the year. And potentially, that will continue as we go through 2024. But don't judge that to be material at this stage. Regarding COVID, to be honest with you, we haven't – COVID is really been stable for us over the past year. In total, our COVID admissions are roughly 2% of our total admissions. I don't really have any data on acuity, but I think it's very, very stable and hasn't really been a material factor in our overall operating results of late.
Operator: Great. Thanks, all. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it over to Frank for closing remarks. Frank, the floor is yours.
Frank Morgan: Sure. Great. Thank you for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. Hope you have a wonderful week, and we'll be around this afternoon and the balance of the week if we can answer any additional questions you might have. Have a good day.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.
Frank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: All right, good morning. Thank you for joining the call. The business fundamentals for the company were solid in the quarter with broad-based volume growth on a same facility basis across our footprint and various service lines. These results reflected continued strong demand for our services and healthy operating margins on a same facility basis. Across most areas of our business, we maintained the operational momentum that we experienced over the past three quarters, including continued progress with our labor agenda. Unfortunately, our results were unfavorably impacted by our Valesco hospital-based physician venture. Bill will give additional detail on this impact in a moment.  We are continuing our efforts to integrate this venture and anticipate implementing additional actions that should improve its operational results over the next few quarters, including less pressure for the company in the fourth quarter. Because of this issue primarily, we have lowered the top side of our earnings guidance for the year to reflect the effects of these losses.  It is important to understand that we believe the decision to consolidate Valesco was strategically imperative in maintaining the overall competitive positioning and capacity offerings of the company. As has been the case historically with our teams, I am confident that we will find a pathway forward to mitigate the impact it has had on our results. For the third quarter, diluted earnings per share were $3.91. Same facility admissions grew 3.4% year-over-year. Inpatient volumes were supported by continued strong acuity and a favorable payer mix with same facility commercial admissions growing an impressive 7%.  Same facility equivalent admissions increased 4.1%. This growth was driven by emergency room visits, which grew 3.5%. We are encouraged by our ER revitalization program and the results it is producing for our patients.  Outpatient surgeries on a same facility basis grew approximately 1% year-over-year. Other outpatient categories also grew, including outpatient cardiology procedures, which increased almost 5%. These factors contributed to an increase in same facility revenue of 7.9% as compared to the prior year.  In the quarter, we continue to invest significantly in our people with additional investments in orientation programs, Galen College of Nursing, and clinical education facilities. Turnover was stable in the quarter and nurse hiring was the strongest it has been all year. These positive results help reduce contract labor costs 12.5% as compared to the third quarter last year and 11% sequentially.  During the quarter we maintained available bed capacity. Instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals represented only 0.9% of total admissions, which is consistent with the rate in the second quarter.  We believe the significant investments we are making in our networks, our people, and our technology agenda will provide us with the necessary resources to improve our service offerings and deliver higher quality care to our patients with greater accessibility.  I'm proud of our people for what they do every day to deliver on our purpose. I want to thank them for their dedication and their overall great work. HCA Healthcare has a disciplined operating culture that we will maintain into the future. This focused approach, which benefits all stakeholders, enhances our ability to execute clinically, strategically and financially.  So let me close with this. We look forward to our upcoming Investor Day on November 9th when we will provide more details about the company's approach to driving sustained long-term growth and shareholder value. We will also provide some early perspectives on the upcoming year as well as longer-term thinking on growth targets.  With that, I will turn the call to Bill for more details on the quarter's results. 
Bill Rutherford : Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter. Consolidated net revenue increased 8.3% to $16.21 billion from $14.97 billion in the prior year period. This was driven by 4.5% growth in equivalent admission and 3.6% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. Same facility revenues grew 7.9%.  As Sam mentioned in his comments, the Valesco joint venture had a negative impact of approximately $100 million on the company's adjusted EBITDA in the quarter as well on a year-to-date basis.  A portion of the third quarter results was due to revising our revenue estimates from the second quarter as we began to see claims being paid. This result was not what we were expecting, as we are experiencing revenue shortfalls compared to what we originally modeled.  The Valesco operating results had a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 80 basis points in the quarter and 40 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Going forward, we anticipate the loss from this venture to approximate $50 million a quarter.  We are working diligently on multiple efforts to address these results, including making programming adjustments where necessary, deploying efforts to reduce the cost structure, and working with payers for more appropriate reimbursement.  As we have discussed previously, we have seen subsidy requests increase from contracted hospital-based providers. Professional fee expense for contracted providers have grown approximately 20% on a year-to-date basis, although we are encouraged the rate of growth of these payments slowed in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter.  In addition to the mitigation strategies discussed above, we continue to assess other operational adjustments within our cost resiliency programs to help offset some of the impact from these issues. Let me speak to some cash flow and capital allocation metrics. Our cash flow from operations was $2.48 billion in the quarter. Capital spending was $1.15 billion. We paid about $160 million of dividends and repurchased $1.14 billion of our stock during the quarter. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio remains near the low end of our stated range of 3x to 4x.  As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2023 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $63.5 billion and $64.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.94 billion and $5.13 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.3 and $12.6 billion, and diluted earnings per share to range between $17.80 and $18.50. We expect capital spending to approximate $4.7 billion for the year.  Before we open it up for questions, I'd like to provide some commentary on our year-to-date performance. We believe our core business metrics remain solid. Year-to-date, our same facility emissions have grown 3.3%. Equivalent emissions have grown 5.1%. Non-COVID admissions have grown 7.5% over prior year on a year-to-date basis.  Same facility ER visits have grown 5.7%. Inpatient surgeries have grown 2.3%, and outpatient surgeries are up 3.1%, all on a year-to-date basis. These volume metrics have outpaced our original expectations going into the year.  Our payer mix trends remain favorable. Same facility managed care admissions increasing 5.3%, and Medicare admissions increasing 4.3% on a year-to-date basis. Medicaid and uninsured admissions are slightly down from the prior year on a year-to-date basis. Our case mix index has held and increased slightly over prior year, and our same facility revenues have increased 6.4% on a year-to-date basis.  Our same facility labor costs and supply costs are below prior year as a percentage of revenue. Through a focused and diligent effort, our operating teams have done an incredible job of addressing the contract labor pressures we had last year. On a year-to-date basis, our contract labor expense is down 18% or over 300 million from the prior year. We have confidence that a similar focused and diligent effort will help address the current physician cost pressures over time.  Lastly, when we look at our current adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2023, we think there are several notable items to consider. We discussed in our year-end call in January, COVID support payments, the out-of-period Texas waiver payment, and the 340B impact from 2022, which all totaled approximately $500 million. And when you consider the $145 million payer settlement we recorded in the first quarter of this year, as we take all of that into account, we are pleased with the growth rate we've been able to achieve.  In addition, our diluted earnings per share, excluding losses on sale of facilities and losses on retirement of debt has grown 7.2% year-to-date. So I wanted to take a moment to put this quarter in some perspective. So with that, we look forward to your questions and I'll turn the call over to Frank to open it up. 
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question, so that we might get as many as possible in the queue, an opportunity to ask a question.  Brianna, you may now give instructions to those who'd like to ask a question. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. 
Kevin Fischbeck : Great, thanks. Maybe just want to build on that last point there. You know, the commentary about the year-to-date performance being strong is well taken, but I guess I get a lot of questions about whether there's anything unusual, I guess, in the performance this year. I think people are trying to figure out whether this is a good base to think about future growth or whether there's anything – whether it's in the volumes or the rate or the payer mix that we really shouldn't be expecting to continue. So I guess, is this a good base and should we think about normal growth off of this? Thanks.
Sam Hazen : Kevin, this is Sam. It’s our belief that demand for healthcare remains strong and will remain strong into the future. Just given the population trends that we see in our market, the aging of the baby boomers, as well as chronic conditions.  I know though there's been a lot of concern about GLP-1 and so forth. We think it's way too early for any of that to have an impact on demand in the near term or even the intermediate term. And so from that standpoint, we're really encouraged by what we see from a demand standpoint.  Our overall competitive positioning, we believe continues to be strong. It's indicated within our market share trends vis-a-vis where we were pre-pandemic, and so we're encouraged by that. We continue to have resources we believe, to continue investing in our company appropriately, and positioning our agenda with the necessary resources to accomplish our objectives.  And so from our standpoint, economies remain strong across our portfolio, and we believe that supports some of the payer mix trends that we've seen. So we're reasonably optimistic here that the overall top line metrics that you are seeing have durability. 
Operator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. You're line is open. 
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Obviously, as you went through, strong results, obviously the focus on this professional fee challenge. I know coming out of the second quarter, you were I think, thinking it would step down in Q3 and Q4. Now it sounds like if anything, it probably stepped up a little bit.  I'm trying to understand, what was the variance in the quarter relative to previous expectations? Was it $50 million? It sounds like even in the quarter there's some catch up from Q2. So maybe it's a significantly bigger number as a negative. And then is the right way to think about Q4 and into next year, a $50 million quarterly run rate that you're assuming discontinues, and therefore you've got to pick up in ‘24, one more $50 million adverse comparison. Hopefully that makes sense.  And if I could squeeze in, just thinking about this quarter, the DPP payment from Florida, was that in line with what you thought or was that the net benefit a little better? 
Bill Rutherford : Yes, A.J., this is Bill. Let me try to take those. So let's talk about Valesco first and isolate that from our pro fees. I would tell you our professional fee expense on Valesco is coming in kind of what we expected. I mean as I said, our rate of growth in the third quarter slowed from the rate of growth from the second quarter, although we continue to see subsidy request and we've got efforts to mitigate those.  There's no doubt the issue for us in the quarter was the Valesco operations as I mentioned. We’re not clearing as much revenue than we anticipated. And I think it’s best you have to look at that on a year-to-date basis, because we did make some revisions as we started to see claims being paid in the third quarter.  And we believe, as I mentioned, it's probably about a $50 million a quarter run rate for Valesco. We have a number of efforts underway to mitigate this that I spoke of as well. But in the short run, that's what we're sizing it at.  You're right, when you look at next year, we'll have three quarters of it this year versus four next year. But we'll give you more of our thinking when we talk about ‘24 later on, but you've sized it about right. 
A.J. Rice: Anything on the Florida? 
Bill Rutherford: The Florida DPP was slightly above what we expected, but we had other programs A.J. that were less than we expected. So you got to look at it in the overall context of the revenue mix of the company and I don't think it's that discreet, necessarily to just focus on one element of it, so. But it was slightly above. 
A.J. Rice: Okay. All right. Thanks so much. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
Ben Hendrix : Thank you very much. Excluding Florida DPP from both quarters, EBITDA margin appears to have declined by about 180 basis points year-over-year, suggesting close to $300 million total headwind. If Valesco is $100 million of that, how would you characterize the remaining $200 million or so that brings us short of the 3Q 2022 margin?  You mentioned the higher subsidy requests and maybe DPP in other quarters or in other regions other than Florida. But is there anything else to call out there that would weigh on margin? Thanks. 
Bill Rutherford: Yes Ben, this is Bill. Isolate the margin, really that other operating line is where you see we've lost some margin for over the years [ph] reported quarter. Valesco was about 50 basis points of that when you adjust for Valesco. Kind of the pro-fee growth was about 40 basis points and the balance was really due to the increase of the supplemental expenses that we recorded in the quarter relative to Florida DPP and other programs.  So the way I think about it, if you exclude Valesco, other operating was off about 120 basis points. 40 to 50 was the pro-fee effect and the balance was just the increase of the supplemental expenses that we recognized in the quarter. Labor was strong when I talked about a supply cost of strength. So it's really isolated to those two issues, the Valesco and supplemental payments as much as anything. 
Sam Hazen: I think, Bill, just to add a point to that, our same facility operating margins, which did include those elements Bill spoke to, were actually in line with our internal expectations. So I think from the standpoint of a little bit of pressure, we anticipated some pressure, but it was reflected again in the overall performance of our same facility. So most of this lands on the Valesco challenge with respect to the revenue and the earnings associated with that venture. 
Ben Hendrix : Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question is from Gary Taylor with T.D. Cowan. Your line is open. 
Gary Taylor: Hey, good morning. One question and one clarification. Just on a clarification, I think we'll see this in the queue, but I think professional fees were 22% of other OpEx in 1Q, 24% in the 2Q. Just wondering what that number was for the third quarter. It sounds like it may be slowed a little bit or didn't change a lot.  And then my real question really was about hitting into ‘24. I mean, we see a lot of volume strength. I mean, if we look at the stat comps, year-to-year admissions, adjusted admissions, ER, all accelerated pretty nicely. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about carrying that volume strength into ‘24, and presumably the guidance you'll give us in a few weeks at Investor Day. 
Sam Hazen: Well Gary, this is Sam, and Bill can jump in here. We believe again that our core business, our hospital-centric core business is performing well. I mean, our volumes were broad-based. Every division in our company had admission growth, had adjusted admission growth. Every service category in our business offerings had growth except for OB.  Our obstetrics volumes, mainly births were down slightly, pediatric was down slightly, and our behavioral was down because we made some capacity adjustments, and not because demand is shrinking in behavioral. Just because we needed capacity that we felt might be more productive. So across geography and across service lines, really solid performance.  On the labor front, we were investing in the quarter in our labor agenda at the same time as making improvements. And what I mean by that, we have invested heavily in new graduate training programs. We've done that throughout the year. That actually created a little bit of a headwind in the quarter and throughout the year for us. We think that will help us as we push into the fourth quarter and on into ‘24, with making adjustments to our labor agenda. We've invested in our Galen College of Nursing facilities, as well as our other clinical education. So we're investing in our agenda for the long-term prospects that all of these initiatives represent.  Bill spoke to the revenue yield. I think the revenue yield from acuity, payer mix, and pricing is positive. So I mentioned that our same-stores results were in line with our expectation.  I think the second thing that's important here Gary, is that we pride ourselves on making adjustments if we have a variance and I am confident in our teams. I'm confident in who we are as an organization. And we've proven it over time that we can make adjustments and find solutions to really complex problems.  And so we've got one. It's not what we anticipated. But again, we had the necessary requirements to consolidate a business that was struggling and somewhat distressed, but very important to our offerings in the community. So I think as we work through it, as we gain a better understanding of it, we will be able to make adjustments and get the proper reimbursement we need from the payers for the services that we're now providing.  And so, fortunately, our balance sheet remains strong as Bill alluded to, and our ability to invest in our agenda to maintain our positioning and execute on our agenda remains strong. So when I pull up and provide some context here, I'm encouraged by what I see in the quarter and for the year and what that portends for the company as we push into the future. 
Bill Rutherford: And, Gary, this is Bill. On your clarification, pro-fees as a percent of other operating, it was just under 24% in Q3, similar to what it was in Q2. 
Gary Taylor: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Ann Hynes : Hi, good morning. I know you don't want to provide 2024 guidance now, but is there any major headwinds and tailwinds that you want to call out before heading into the event? And to that degree, I know Nevada is introducing a UPL program. Do you have any sense what that incremental benefit will be next year? Thanks. 
Bill Rutherford: Ann, this is Bill. Yeah there is. Only one we'll pull out, as I mentioned in my comments, is the payer settlement we recorded in the first quarter. Other than that, we'll give you our full commentary later on 2024. And on Nevada, it's still too early. We're waiting for the approval level and when we discuss ‘24, we'll update you on what our thinking is and the estimate of that is. 
Ann Hynes : All right, thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
Whit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Sam, can you maybe just go back and elaborate on the ER revitalization program. How Valesco plays into that and exactly where you are in the evolution of that program and any tangible progress that you expect to see in 2024? Thanks. 
Sam Hazen: So our ER revitalization program was initiated maybe a year ago, nine months ago, without remembering the exact point. We determined that a couple of things. One, demand for emergency room services continues to be robust. It was actually more resilient coming out of the pandemic than we had anticipated.  So we felt we needed to reenergize our operations, because we had had some turnover in our leadership and we had business opportunity associated with demand. So our teams came together and went about sort of revitalizing, for lack of a better term, our basic operations with respect to our emergency rooms.  We have proven standards and processes over time that we think create a really good experience and a positive outcome for our patients. And so we wanted to retrain a number of our new leaders, including some of our physician leaders through Valesco and others into these standards and these processes.  And the early results of our program are really positive. Our patient satisfaction is up four or five points from when we began the program. Our throughput continues to improve. I think we're seeing an ER patient within nine or 10 minutes with a clinician, as soon as they present to our door. Our throughput times with respect to discharging our patients has improved, as well as those who get admitted, we’re able to get them onto the floors more efficiently than we were before.  We continue to believe we have opportunities to strengthen that program, and so we're expanding the reach of our training. Again, that will include our physician leaderships, both in Valesco, as well as other hospital provider contractors that we have. And we think this will play in well with into our investments that we're making, into our emergency room platform, both hospital-based as well as our freestanding emergency rooms, which continue to perform at an even higher level.  So all of that to say is its yielded volume growth, it's yielded patient throughput improvement, and most importantly, it's yielded patient satisfaction increases that we are encouraged by and we will continue to hopefully achieve. 
Whit Mayo: Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. 
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning guys. Sam, it seems like you have an idea of what needs to be done at Valesco. But maybe going down to the nuts and bolts of it, as we think about the fact that you employ these docs now, it sounds like this is more of a revenue issue. So is that just a matter of tacking them onto the HCA contract or what needs to be done there? Maybe just for Bill, and kind of related to this, if you can give us the contribution of Valesco to revenue per same-store admin. Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Let me speak to how we're approaching it. Again, we're learning as we go. I forgot the – I think it was like 5,000 physicians across, how many programs? 
Bill Rutherford: 200 programs.
Sam Hazen: 200 different programs. A really large-scale business that again, we felt we were at a point where we had to make a decision and I am comfortable that we made the right decision for the company long-term.  So as we learn more and more about this business, we think there are going to be opportunities on how we allocate the staffing underneath this business. Obviously, our emergency rooms are 24/7/365. We won't necessarily change the staffing per se, but there could be complimentary approaches to that.  There are overhead opportunities we think over time we will be able to get to. But you're right, ultimately we will need to get paid for these services appropriately. We do have some contracts today. We feel like those will have to be adjusted in the future. And we are confident that we can achieve appropriate reimbursement underneath these programs and get us to where it's an appropriate service that's reimbursed reasonably as we get through it.  But that’s just not happening immediately and that’s part of the challenge. And again, we need anesthesiologists, we need emergency room physicians, we need hospitals in order to deliver the volume and maintain provisioning. And so that rationale went into our decision-making, and so now we have to rationalize the operations, and I think those are the areas that we're going to focus on. And we believe in a reasonable period of time we'll make progress on that. 
Bill Rutherford: Brian, to your revenue numbers, Valesco revenue is just under $400 million year-to-date, about $380 million on a year-to-date basis. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. 
Stephen Baxter : Yes, hi thanks. I appreciate all the commentary on the professional fees and the growth slowing in the third quarter. So it does still seem like a pretty challenging environment out there for those firms. And as we do some checks, hearing and anesthesia in particular remains a pressure point. Is this something that you think you can manage closer to flat going forward or is this just becoming part of the new norm around something that you'll need to offset as you think about the puts and takes for 2024? Thank you. 
Bill Rutherford: Well, it's hard to call. We do believe the rate of growth is too slow going forward compared to what we've seen this year. As I said, we're working diligently on multiple work efforts, not only in Valesco, but working with our contracted providers as well. So again, I think we'll see slowing growth. We think we've dealt with some of the more acute issues out there. But the subsidy requests are still there, but we're managing through it and we'll continue to do that as we continue to go on. We'll update you on our progress. But we're working diligently to affect and slow that rate of growth and its impact on us. 
Sam Hazen: I think Bill alluded to this in his commentary earlier about the pressures we saw with contract labor, nurse shortages, capacity management and so forth. And I would submit that we've worked our way through that reasonably well, and we still believe there are opportunities for us to make strides forward on that agenda.  We're going to learn from that how we managed that timely, aggressively, and responsibly, and I think apply those same learnings to the situation we have here, and get to an answer that makes sense for the company. And so I'm confident, as I've said, that we have the mindset and the wherewithal to work through these and get us to a reasonable solution. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
Pito Chickering : Hey, good morning, guys. There are a lot of moving parts in the margin this quarter, but if you normalize for Florida DPP and the $50 million from prior period in Valesco, and look at the implied fourth quarter margin ramp, it looks higher than normal sequential margin improvement for the fourth quarter. So can you help bridge us or what are the key drivers to get to that implied guidance for margin for 4Q? 
Sam Hazen: Yes, Pito, historically our fourth quarter is our best margin performance quarter. I mean, obviously this quarter was impacted a little higher than normal because of the Valesco 80 basis points I talked about, and the Florida DPP. Our state facility margins were over 20%, so we think our guidance is reasonable based on our outlook right now. But I think it's a combination of maybe not having some of the immediate pressures we had this quarter, and the expectation that the fourth quarter tends to trend stronger than our average. 
Pito Chickering : All right, thanks so much. 
Sam Hazen: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cal Sternick with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. 
Cal Sternick: Thanks for the question. Just wanted to go back to Valesco for a second. So is the expectation that the $50 million loss per quarter persists this level throughout next year or would you expect to end the year at a slightly lower run rate?  And then just on the mitigation levers, I mean obviously it sounds like reimbursement is probably the bigger component here, but is there any way to give a sense for magnitude of the cost side? I'm just wondering if you could give some color on what those levers are, and just how much of that $50 million do you think could offset purely just with cost reductions? 
Bill Rutherford: Yes, I mean, so right now as I said, probably $50 million a quarter, but we're working diligently to mitigate that. And as we go through the next couple of quarters and into ‘24, we'll continue to update our progress on that.  We view the primary issue as revenue shortfalls, and that's what we're working through. There are maybe some cost adjustments we can make, but I think it's primarily a revenue approach that we're going to take to try to turn the results around. And I just have to put -- it's $50 million a quarter, and we have confidence that we've dealt with similar issues in the past, and we'll work through that, but it's primarily a revenue challenge that we'll get through.  I did mention it earlier, but with our increased position, we now manage the revenue cycle all the way through. So I think that puts us in a much better position to assess and address some of these revenue trends. So we have the revenue cycle functions from contracting to coding to billing and collections. And so we think we're in a reasonably good position to be able to at least assess those trends and then come up with appropriate actions to respond to it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Cassorla with Citi Group. Your line is open. 
Jason Cassorla: Great, thanks. I guess with surgeries up about 1% in the quarter, a little bit better on the inpatient side. I wanted to ask about trends within service lines, and the comp was a little bit difficult this quarter, but anything to call out there?  And then Sam, it sounds like from your comments, you're not seeing any impact in GLP-1’s and you don't expect much there, but just making sure we caught that right. And if you have any other thoughts on potential impacts to underlying demand or trends on the line, it'll be helpful. Thanks. 
Sam Hazen: Yes, let me start with the GLP issue. We think it's way too early to make any judgment about the effects on our business generally. I think the second point that I would make related to GLP-1 is the fact that we have a very diversified mix of revenue as a company. I mean, obviously we've gone through orthopedic total joints going from inpatient to outpatient. We've seen other drugs come into the mix, statins as an example with cardiology. We're actually doing more cardiology procedures in the company now than we've ever done in the history of the company.  So, I don't really know how to judge the implications. Bariatric surgeries in our company is a really small program, less than 0.5% of overall revenue. Obviously we have patients who do have diabetes, but some of those patients aren't going to lose it necessarily immediately either. So, it's way too early to make judgments, we believe, around that.  When you look at the mix of business, again, as I said earlier, we had very broad-based service line performance that was solid. Very few service categories were down. We actually had a calendar headwind in the quarter with respect to surgical days and cardiology procedure days, where we had one less surgical day in the quarter than we did last year.  So our performance in the face of that headwind was strong as well. So that's what I would say. It was similar on inpatient and outpatient as far as the mix of service volume growth and so forth. So very consistent, very broad-based, again, across our geography, and so we're pretty pleased with the output. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open. 
Scott Fidel : Thanks. I was hoping you could maybe talk about some of these recent developments in the environment as it relates to the potential indicators around future wage trends, and in particular thinking about some of the union actions that we've been seeing and some of these minimum wage laws that are getting passed at the state level, such as in California.  Just curious on sort of whether you see these in aggregate potentially creating some more pro-inflationary pressure on wages, or do you think that there may be a bit over, sort of focused on and won't affect the overall trajectory of the wage environment? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: The market for labor has normalized in very material ways compared to where it was a year to year and a half ago. And we're seeing it in our cost per hour as a company, which is really lined up with the expectations we've had for the year. And we've seen stabilization across the elements of our compensation programs and so forth.  There are some minimum wage laws out in California that has a very de-minimis impact on our company. Most of our compensation was already in line with that. We have very few issues with that.  Unionization across the country beyond the healthcare industry is an issue as everybody understands. But we have been successful in pushing through those issues organizationally and have landed in a spot that we think is not going to put too much pressure on our business in the near term.  And so that's where we are. Obviously the markets changed. They are dynamic, and we have to adjust to those. But we're seeing positive signs with respect to turnover, with respect to hiring, and even the number of new students who are populating our Galen College of Nursing programs is very encouraging, suggesting that there's a sufficient pipeline of new nurses who want to be educated and go into the workforce.  So we're pretty encouraged by the macros that we're seeing. There are obviously issues that we have to pay attention to, and we are, but we're reasonably encouraged with our overall agenda as it relates to our people and the efforts that we have in place. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Jamie Perse : Hey, thank you. Good morning. Just a bigger picture question for you guys. You've talked about longer term margins, 19% to 20% being a fairly sustainable range for you. A lot of moving parts right now. So just at a high level, is there anything you see in the business right now that can take you off of that trajectory more permanently and just your level of confidence in getting back to that margin rate and sustaining it going forward? Thank you. 
Bill Rutherford: Yes, I mean – this is Bill. I think we have a reasonably long track record of producing margins that are in a pretty tight range. Even as we've dealt with periodic cost pressures, whether it be contract labor before or maybe bad debts in the previous cycle or physician costs now.  So I think as a team, we have confidence we can continue to operate the company at reasonably strong efficiency levels. We've spoken in the past, we have a number of initiatives around technology and innovation on resiliency programs that continue to target the opportunities to operate even more efficiently in the future. So I think our historical performance is a reasonable expectation for us and we've got opportunity to continue to drive efficiency through the organization.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James. Your line is open. 
John Ransom: Hey, good morning. If I take your $380 million of Valesco, I think you did a little over $220 million in 2Q. So that means the revenue dropped sequentially by like $60 million. I know you're talking about this revenue problem, but in your guidance going forward, maybe you could clarify kind of your revenue and cost outlook to get you to that minus $50 million.  And again, why was it such a – I know seasonality, but why was it such a steep ramp in 3Q or decline in 3Q in revenue? Unless I'm doing my numbers wrong, thanks. 
Bill Rutherford: Yes John, I alluded to this in my comments. We did make some revisions to our revenue estimates in the third quarter. In the second quarter, it's still new. We were putting providers on new contracts billing. We had not received a lot of claims being paid as claims started to be adjudicated and paid. So I think it's better to look at that on a year-to-date basis on there.  It's roughly $200 million a quarter, somewhere around that neighborhood. It’s kind of what we think the model will be going forward. Again, it may fall on either side of that, but I think it's best to look at the year-to-date. We understand the third quarter drop, but it was really just because we had no history on there and as claims started to be paid, we were able to revise that.  So that's why it's $100 million EBITDA for the quarter. It was about the same year-to-date. It's kind of tied into our $50 million going forward. 
John Ransom: So its $200 million revenue, $250 million cost business is what's embedded in your guide going forward, just to be clear. 
Bill Rutherford: Yes, if you want to think very broadly, that would be pretty consistent. 
John Ransom: All right, thank you. 
Bill Rutherford: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. 
Justin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. I'm going to pile on with this physician stuff. So just, I've never seen a business kind of be off this far from like you guys are obviously very, very good at what you do. I know this is a new business, but to be $50 million of revenue on a $250 million baseline, 20%. So I just the like, can you triple click on that for me and just say like, what did you think was going on versus what is?  And then the, for – when you gave your headwinds, tailwinds for next year, the only headwind you talked about was that payment, which makes sense. But you've given some numbers around the subsidy costs right, the physician costs that run through other operating. And they do seem like they've been a pretty big drag on margins. My estimate is somewhere around $300 million bucks, give or take year-over-year, versus kind of revenue growth.  Are you assuming that that's not going to grow at anywhere close to that pace next year or do you think you could like – and therefore it's not another $300 million headwind next year? Or are you just assuming that we can offset it? And so, we kind of grow normally ex-$145 million. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: All right, Justin, well a couple of things. One, literally we talk about ’24. We'll give you our ‘24 guidance assumptions, some of that on the Investor Day in more details as we go through the planning on there. But as I said, we are expecting the pro-fee growth rate trends to lower going forward and we're working diligently to make that happen.  On your opening question around Valesco, just to emphasize what Sam said, this was a very complex and large integration of 200 programs, 5,000 providers that happened very quickly. And we were operating maybe on some incomplete historical data. And as we started to see claims being paid, the revenue was just clearing at lower rates than we anticipated. And again, I think we've got a number of initiatives to try to offset that and so we're working on both of those.  But so, that's how I would address the Valesco shortfall right now. And then, we're continuing to work on the pro-fee and do expect that growth rate to decline going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. 
Sarah James : Thank you. So, when I look at the moving pieces in the guidance revision and the change in the Valesco revenue, it looks like you guys are implying core is doing a little bit better, especially if I use midpoint. So can you give us an update on what you're seeing so far, the first couple months into 4Q volumes and how we should think about what 2023 guidance implies for the volume transition from 3Q to 4Q? 
Bill Rutherford: Yeah. So, as you know, we don't comment on the current quarter. We've made, I think, several comments on the core business trends we're seeing with really strong volume, reasonable pricing, the core operating expenses of the company are doing well in labor market supplies. I think as a broad brush, it would be our expectation those trends generally continue going forward. We don't see anything from a macro perspective changing that. But again, too early and we're not commenting on kind of inter-quarter, early quarter activities.  But as I said, and Sam mentioned in his comments, we're pleased with the core fundamentals that we're seeing. Good demand in the market. We're positioned very well, and our same facility operations is going pretty well.  Unfortunately, we are dealing with the Valesco integrations and we'll overcome that. But I think you could reasonably expect that our core trends that we've seen year-to-date should for the most part continue at a reasonable pace. 
Sarah James : Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open. 
Joshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. I hate to beat this dead horse, but just on the reduction in revenues on Valesco as the claims were getting processed, I'm just curious, what was causing that reduction in revenue? Was that, a lower rate issue, was that payer mix, was that reduction in code submitted versus paid or was that just less services?  And then I know there's been some challenges to the No Surprises Act underway. I know the arbitration process just started back up again. Is any of that going to mitigate any of the impact there? 
Sam Hazen: Yes. Yes, so it's hard to attribute the shortfall in any one area. As I said, we were operating on maybe some incomplete historical data as our model is, and probably an array of other issues that potential other hospital providers are experiencing.  And so, yes, we've got a number of initiatives that we're going to try to address that we've talked about. We can continue to see – we prefer to be an in-network providers to avoid the out of – the surprise billing and that IVR process. And so we're working with our payers diligently to be in-network and to get reasonable rates going forward, and that's going to be part of our action plan. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Sam Hazen : Brianna, I think we're done, if you want to close the queue. 
Operator: Thank you. Seeing no further questions, I will now turn the call back over to Frank Morgan for closing remarks. 
Frank Morgan: Brianna, thank you so much for your help today, and thanks to everyone for joining on the call. I'm around this afternoon if I can answer any additional questions you might have. Have a great day. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.
Frank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn it over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA is included in today's press release. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning. Thank you for joining the call. The company produced solid earnings in the second quarter. These results reflected continued strong demand for our services and healthy operating margins. Across most areas of our business, we maintain the operational momentum that we experienced over the past 3 quarters. We believe this strength should continue into the second half of the year. Accordingly, we updated our earnings guidance for 2023 to reflect this outlook. Against the difficult comparison to the second quarter of 2022, diluted earnings per share increased to $4.29. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong. Admissions grew 2.2% year-over-year, inpatient surgeries increased 1.8%, same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.7%. This growth was driven by emergency room visits, which grew 3.7% and outpatient surgeries which grew 3.3%. Other outpatient categories also grew, including outpatient cardiology procedures, with increased 5%. The growth in volumes was broad-based across the company's divisions and diversified within most service lines. Additionally, volumes were supported by strong acuity growth of 1.6% and a favorable payer mix from commercial adjusted admissions growth of 5%. These factors drove an increase in same facility revenue of 6.3% as compared to the prior year. In the quarter, we continued to invest in our people, and as a result, we saw improvements across virtually all key labor metrics. Turnover continued to decline for nurses and trended at an annualized rate of 17%. Nurse hiring remained strong in the quarter and for the year has increased by 9% as compared to last year. These positive results helped reduce contract labor costs 20% compared to the second quarter last year. During the quarter, we improved available bed capacity. Instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals declined and represented 0.8% of total admissions, down from 1.5% in the first quarter. We believe the significant investments we are making in our networks, our people and our technology agenda will provide us with the necessary resources to improve our services and provide even higher quality care to our patients. As we look to the future, we remain encouraged by both the backdrop of strong demand that we expect in our markets and our overall competitive positioning within them. HCA Healthcare will continue to use its disciplined operating culture to execute our strategic and capital allocation plans. I want to thank our colleagues for their dedication and their overall effectiveness. So let me close with this. I want to speak to a recent event that we take very seriously. On July 10, we announced that we had recently discovered a list of certain information with respect to some of our patients was made available by an unknown and unauthorized party on an online forum. We have confirmed that the list does not include clinical information, payment information or other sensitive information like passwords, driver's license or social security numbers. Our forensic investigation is ongoing, but this event appears to be a theft from an external storage location that was exclusively used to format e-mail messages. We are in the process of notifying all affected patients in accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations. And not unexpectedly, we have been named as a defendant in multiple class action lawsuits. This incident has not caused any disruption to our day-to-day operations nor do we believe it will materially impact our business or financial results. HCA Healthcare believes the privacy of its patients is a vital part of its mission and remains committed to maintaining the security of their personal information. With that, I will turn the call to Bill for more details on the quarter's results.
Bill Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter. Consolidated net revenue increased 7% to $15.86 billion from $14.82 billion in the prior year period. This was driven by 4% growth in equivalent admissions and 2.9% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. We remain pleased with our team's management of operating costs even with the backdrop of inflation. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.3% in the quarter. During the quarter, we completed our transaction to acquire a majority stake in the Valesco joint venture and we are now consolidating the operations of this venture. This reduced our consolidated margins approximately 30 basis points in the quarter. We believe this transaction not only mitigates business risk with the Envision bankruptcy proceedings but will also further support alignment between our hospital-based physicians and our hospital care teams on improving quality, patient satisfaction and efficiencies. When you consider this transaction and the $145 million payer settlement we recognized last quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margins have remained consistent between the first and second quarters. So let me speak to some cash flow and capital allocation metrics as they remain a key part of our long-term growth and value creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations increased $845 million in the quarter from $1.63 billion in the prior year to $2.475 billion this year. Capital spending was just over $1.2 billion. We paid $164 million in dividends and repurchased $915 million of our stock during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio remains near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3 times to 4 times. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2023 guidance as follows: We expect revenues to range between $63.25 billion and $64.75 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.9 billion and $5.255 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.3 billion and $12.8 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $17.70 and $18.90, and we expect capital spending to approximate $4.7 billion during the year. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank and open it up for Q&A.
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. [Operator Instructions] Bailey, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: Maybe just -- I know Sam in his prepared remarks said that performance was solid across divisions. I wondered, there's been some discussion this quarter about Florida and Texas had come back early and had enjoyed strong volume. Now the rest of the country is rebounding. I wonder if you could comment on that. There was also a discussion from some of the managed care guys about particularly seeing strength in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and some pent-up demand being unleashed there. I wondered if you would comment on whether you're seeing any of that as well.
Sam Hazen: As I mentioned in my comments, our volume growth was broad-based across our divisions. I think we had 13 out of 16 divisions in the company that had admission growth and adjusted admission growth. We clearly have some divisions that don't perform the same pretty much every quarter, but it was fairly broad-based across top line metrics, admissions, adjusted admissions, payer mix improvements and so forth. So a fairly consistent performance. We did have a couple of divisions that struggled, but one was isolated in Florida. The other one was isolated more out west in the Midwest. And so for the most part, we were really pleased with the overall performance that we had across the geographies of the company. And it's interesting, I was looking at something yesterday. We have, from an admission standpoint, almost 72% of our hospitals have greater than 2% admission growth for the year. And this includes a little bit of pressure from COVID in the first part of the year from a comparison standpoint. We have very significant performance from the surgery standpoint as well, where almost 50% of our hospitals have inpatient surgery growth above 2%. So really consistent portfolio performance that speaks to the strength of our markets, I think the competitive positioning of our facilities and then the ongoing network development and physician development that we have as part of our core strategy.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.
Ben Hendrix: With regard to your updated guidance, can you provide some more color on what you're assuming for SWB, supplies and other operating expense, particularly professional fees through the second half versus what you've seen thus far this year? And then anything to call out that would alter typical cadence through the second half?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Ben, this is Bill. Let me start. I think our updated guidance reflects what we're observing in the market on our year-to-date performance, which continue [Audio Gap] in the growth opportunities. I think net-net, when I think about the margin profile of the company between the first half and the second half of the year, we'd expect the margin profile to be slightly better in the second half of the year. I think our salary, wages and benefits as a percent of revenue were running mostly where they're running year-to-date. Same with supplies. We have seen a little pressure on the professional fees. And we don't think that same pressure will exist in the balance of the year but will be able to meet us through that.
Operator: The next question comes from Whit Mayo with Leerink Partners.
Whit Mayo: Maybe just a question around labor. I think I heard you say, Bill, that contract labor improved maybe 20% year-over-year. Did it change much throughout the quarter? Just trying to get a sense of maybe the exit rate and expectations for the second half of the year?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. I mean, we're pleased with the labor environment. We did mention our contract labor is down 20% versus the prior year. It's improved as well sequentially between Q2 and Q1. Our hiring metrics are up, turnover is down. And I think that portends good things for us going through the balance of the year. We mentioned before, our contract labor cost as a percentage of our SWB was under 7%. I think it was 6.8% in the quarter. So again, I think we're pleased with that. Especially as we go through the summer months, some of our hires get through kind of their orientation process. And then we get into the balance of the year, we would expect some continued improvement.
Operator: The next question comes from Gary Taylor with Cowen.
Gary Taylor: Just two quick ones for me. Bill, I might have missed it, but I know often you kind of run through some of the managed care metrics on admissions -- adjusted admission and surgeries, I wondering if you could rattle off a few of those for us? And then secondly, I just want to make sure I understood on the Envision joint venture, I think we were thinking that was maybe roughly $250 million of revenue. But do all the expenses lie in the SWB line? Is that where those reside down to kind of a roughly EBITDA breakeven?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Gary, let me start with that. Some of our managed care, I think as we mentioned in the same mentioned her comments, really favorable payer mix. Our managed care admissions were up over 4% in the quarter. Adjusted admissions were 5%. I think we mentioned that in our prepared comments. Emergency visits managed care were up 9.8% in the quarter, and again, good acuity of case mix growth. So we're really pleased with the payer mix that we're seeing, and that showed itself in the commercial trends. Relative to the Valesco joint venture, your numbers are really close. About 70% to 75% of the revenue is in SWB and the rest is in other operating. And you're right, it's basically a breakeven proposition a little north of $220 million of revenue that we had in the quarter as we consolidated that.
Operator: And your next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: Question on the pricing in the quarter. So with strong acuity and strong and strong payer mix, maybe can you remind us, is there anything in the second quarter that I might have slipped that, drove the pricing? I would have expected it to be a little bit better given those mix items and strong commercial pricing. And then, Bill, can you just give us what you expect in the back half of the year for volumes? Would that be the guidance?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Justin, nothing specific I will call out. I mean, obviously when we do year-over-year comparisons, COVID was still an impact for us. We had roughly $40 million of COVID support payments last year that we don't have this year. Our COVID admissions were 3% of total last year, roughly 1%. So that's still influencing a little bit on the revenue line. On our volume projections for the balance of the year, I think we'll be largely consistent. We've seen thus far, our year-to-date admissions same facility are about 3.3%. I would think for the full year, we hover around 3% as well for the balance of the year. Our adjusted admissions year-to-date are 5.6%. I would think by the time we finish full year, it's still 5% to 6% adjusted admissions. So I think the volume trends we would expect in the second half of the year will be pretty consistent with what we've seen in the first half of the year.
Operator: And the next question will come from Phil Chickering with Detroit Bank.
Phil Chickering: As I look at the implied revenue raise and EBITDA raise at the back half of the year, I'm trying to understand the flow-through of how much revenue raises should flow through into EBITDA upside. So how is it tracking in sort of 2023 versus sort of pre-COVID years?
Bill Rutherford: Well, when I think about that, when I look at the rate, it's based on where we perform them in our view of the position going forward. We do expect continued improvement in the labor market. But as I said, I think as a percent of revenue, we hold, I think the margin profile overall for the second half of the year will be slightly better than the margin profile we saw in the first half of the year. And that, all in all, has contributed to the guidance raise. I remind you, we've raised our guidance almost the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance, roughly $450 million from where we turn the calendar. So I think all that's reflective in our considerations right now.
Sam Hazen: Yes. And Bill, let me add a point here. I think it's a relevant point. Obviously, we've dealt with a fairly unprecedented labor market over the last 3 years or so. And we do believe, as Bill indicated earlier, it's moderating. We've also dealt with sort of an unprecedented hospital-based physician dynamic at a macro level. And if you just take a snapshot of where we are 6 months into this year versus where we were pre-pandemic when neither of these macro forces were in place, we've actually increased our margins by comparison to 2019. So I think it's sort of a testament to the ability of the company to adjust operationally to dynamics and continue to move forward with our strategy. As we've mentioned before, we think our competitive positioning has improved compared to where we were pre-pandemic.  Our market share has also improved during that time period. So we continue to believe that the company has the wherewithal to adjust to these factors, continue to move ahead in a very positive way and generate the results that we all want.
Operator: And your next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Group.
Ann Hynes: I know it's early, but do you have any observations on how Medicaid determinations is impacting your business? I know one of your bigger states, Texas, started early. It sounds like it's been a little bit messy. So any early observations? And can you remind us if you have anything from the KB determinations in your guidance? And do you think this process is going to be an overall positive or negative for HCA?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Thanks for that. It's a good question. And you're right, it is still early, and we've got a pretty organized approach to not only continue to watch the market but respond on there. So we haven't seen any negative or any material impact on this today. We think what we're seeing many of the patients who are receiving determination, that there's some opportunity to continue to get them reenrolled in Medicaid, some of them are more technical. They either didn't complete an application or some other aspect of that. So our teams are trying to identify those individuals as best they can, assist them in gaining coverage, which remain encouraged by many of the studies that the people are being redetermined off, who will qualify either for coverage in an employer sponsor plan or qualify for coverage in the health insurance marketplace. And so we'll continue to watch that as that unfolds. But no impact right now. Nothing in our guidance is assumed for Medicaid redetermination. We believe over the long run, there could be some positive trends from this but we'll just have to wait to see how that plays out.
Operator: And the next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: I wanted to just maybe dig in a little bit more to kind of how you're thinking about the volume growth in the back half of the year. I guess when you think about [Indiscernible] trending relatively similar in the back half versus the first half, I guess the way we had been thinking about it any way was that last year, it felt like as COVID spiked at the beginning of the year and then became less and less of an issue that volume to started to kind of normalize in the back half of the year. And so that maybe the comp would be a little more difficult as you got into Q4 and if the growth rate might slow. So I just want to think about how you're thinking about volume growth and where you are versus maybe long-term trend lines and things like that. How do you put that into context about thinking this rate of growth will continue in the back half of the year?
Sam Hazen: Kevin, this is Sam. Let me give you sort of the backdrop, we think, of what exists for us with respect to volume. And this is more of a general commentary. I'll let Bill sort of reconcile the back half of the year to the first half of the year with numbers, I'm not sure I can do that at this particular point in time. As we said before, and we continue to believe this we feel that within our markets, there's unique attributes that are driving solid demand for health care services. Population growth continues to be strong in Texas and Florida, in Utah, Nevada, South Carolina, pretty much Tennessee. Across the board, we're experiencing population growth within our markets. The second point is we're investing very significantly in our strategy and our positioning within these communities so that we can respond to our patient needs, put our facilities in the best position to grow. And we think that's going to help us sustain market share growth as we move forward. What we're seeing is that our overall volume assumptions are supported by acuity. Acuity has maintained, some of that strategic, some of that, I think, is the dynamics that exist within the markets. And then the second support mechanism that's in place, and we view this positively, is the payer mix dynamic. We have seen throughout the first half of the year, commercial admissions outpaced our total admissions. Again, we think that's reflective of a strong economy and job positioning that a lot of people have in our communities as well as the exchanges. And so we think those will continue on into the last half of this year. And we're optimistic that those will continue on into the future, at least in the near term. So Bill, you can maybe try to reconcile…
Bill Rutherford: I'll just say, I mean, when we think about projecting going forward, we try to take all of those factors into consideration, as Sam mentioned and where we're seeing year-to-date. Mind you, when we originally said our guidance, we anticipated 1% to 2% admission growth, mid-single-digit outpatient growth. So that's still hovering around 2% to 3% equivalent admission growth was our expectation. And given the fact that we're seeing north of 3% admission growth and 5.5% adjusted admission, that's informing our position for the balance of the year. So I still think around 3 is a good number for the full year now based on the first 6 months of the year. We're continuing to see good outpatient revenue growth. And so that should support this 5% to 6% equivalent admission expectation for the full year.
Sam Hazen: Yes. And Bill, if I can add one thing. With respect to our investments in our networks. We have, at this particular juncture, the largest pipeline of projects that are in motion, including our outpatient development components which are very robust as well as other inpatient and facility needs there. So our pipeline from an organic standpoint as far as capital that we will see hit the market in latter '23, '24, early '25 is more robust than we've seen in pretty much recent years.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Bill, you touched on the impact of Envision being a 30 basis point drag. I know there's some -- a lot of noise happening with American Physician Partners and just stuff moving around the physician staffing. So as we think about that drag, is there opportunity to bring that up? Or is that like a more structural thing where you've had to bring in in-house capabilities for physician staffing?
Sam Hazen: Yes. This is Sam. Let me start with that and Bill can color in here. As I mentioned, the backdrop in the hospital-based physician space has been very difficult over the past few years because of multiple factors. And for us, in the short run, we have had to respond to these difficulties to maintain capacity and service availability and so forth. And so we did what we had to do to make sure that our business continue to move forward appropriately. And for the most part, we've overcome these pressures and been able to grow, and we've increased our earnings expectations for the year in the face of some of these challenges. As Bill mentioned, we don't anticipate the same level of increases and pressures in the last half of the year, although we'll have some. But it's not going to nearly be what we've experienced in the first part, we don't think. And we do believe with the Valesco operations, we now have a platform that gives us the potential to respond better to these type of challenges and possibly integrate hospital-based physicians into our hospital operations even more effectively, producing better clinical performance efficiency and even growth, we think. And so -- and I'll say this again, I said it earlier, we have a pattern of responding to different kind of operational challenges, whatever they happen to be. We've had labor, as I mentioned. We've had physician costs. Currently, we've had uninsured in the past. And we've tended to overcome them. In the short run, sometimes they can create an individual pressure. But I think the scale of HCA, the resources that we have and the ability to execute allows us to move through some of these pressures over time and get where we want to be.
Operator: And the next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.
Lance Wilkes: I've got a strategic question for you on digital health and AI. I was just interested in the initiatives that you're kind of putting in place through the organization at this point, where you're maybe investing on the venture capital side here. And long term, what do you see is the opportunity for this, whether it's potentially reduced compensation or an ability to expand volume across the footprint?
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. We have a growing digital agenda in our company, and I'm very excited about what the prospects are for us around that. We are investing in a new clinical system, which we think is going to allow us to move information to the cloud more efficiently, and a matter of fact, move standard data sets into the cloud so that we can then use big data even more effectively and infuse that back into the care process. We will couple our digital agenda with something we're calling care transformation innovation. And inside of that, we believe we have opportunities to improve care processes, eliminate a lot of the variation that exists today in our company, create better quality and, at the same time, more efficiencies. Artificial Intelligence, we believe, will play a huge part in that. It's way early for us to know exactly what that will be and how that will influence our agenda, but we're encouraged about the prospects for it. We are partnering with some very sophisticated companies to help us push through this in ways that I think will accelerate our agenda and inform it with more expertise than what we have internally. So we're excited about what this can yield for us as we push into our next life cycle, if you will. And we'll wait to see what Artificial Intelligence, in fact, can do. But we view it as a positive potential for us in a very significant way.
Operator: The next question comes from Andrew Mok with UBS.
Andrew Mok: I just wanted to follow up on the pricing discussion maybe from a different angle. Revenue per outpatient equivalent looks, like it was down about 1% in the quarter, which seems to be weighing on strong inpatient pricing up 6%. Can you help us understand the pricing and mix trends across your outpatient platform that are causing that unit revenue metric to blend down this year?
Bill Rutherford: Well, I'd say we're pleased with the outpatient growth that we're seeing. If you look at the overall outpatient growth that we have, it's -- our expectation was mid-single digits. We're well north of that in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. There's always a little bit of a mix issue that occurs. Our emergency room volume was up, what, 3.7%, which were a lot of are outpatient. Our outpatient surgical growth was up 3.3% in the quarter. So I think those are really good stats. On the outpatient revenue, per unit. There's always a blend between surgical, emergency room and diagnostic. But I would say, overall, we're very pleased with the outpatient overall growth that we are seeing.
Sam Hazen: Yes. And Bill, just the second quarter overall outpatient revenue growth was actually up over the first quarter. So we are seeing some acceleration. There's a lot of moving parts, as Bill just alluded to, to outpatient revenues between physician, clinics, urgent care, all the way up to outpatient cardiology procedures, which tend to be our highest reimbursed type of procedures. And so the mix of that can influence the outpatient. We tend to look at it in the aggregate. And for the most part, our aggregate revenue growth has been stronger in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. And then within sort of the pricing elements, we continue to get the targeted price increases that we want in both our inpatient and our outpatient businesses. So it's more, to Bill's point, sort of the mix and the mixture of all of the different components in a way that has produced solid growth for us.
Operator: Next question comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan.
Calvin Sternick: I wanted to ask about the commercial rate cycle. I think last quarter, you said you guys are about 2/3 of the way through 2024 and about 1/4 of the way through 2025. Can you give us an update on the progress and how those rate discussions are evolving?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. They're evolving pretty consistent. As we just mentioned, we're continuing to see rates in kind of the mid-single digit level. As far as contracted for '24, I think we're a little north of 70% for '24 now. And I think our efforts continue. I think our relationships with our major payers continue to be strong and we're pleased with the progress we're making in that area.
Operator: And the next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.
Scott Fidel: Interested just as against the backdrop where the managed care payers are seeing the higher medical cost trends this year, whether you're seeing any changes in behaviors when interfacing with them from a prior authorization or utilization management-type perspective? Or are things pretty consistent there? And then just a quick follow-up, just on the slight raise in the CapEx. Is that just related to the general broad-based investments that Sam just talked about? Or are there any specific projects that you would cite around the update to the CapEx guide?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, let me try to take both of those. I think as we maybe mentioned in the past, as you think about authorization and medical necessity reviews, those activities have picked up again as -- during the COVID period of time, those have eased a little bit. But we still see a lot of friction, if you will, as you go through that effort. We work with our payers to try to resolve those appropriately, make sure that we defend our positions where necessary. But there is a level of activity that both us and the payers have to devote to try to smooth through that process. But we tend to be able to work our way through it. On the CapEx, I think it's simply reflective of the opportunities we see in the market to continue to deploy capital for growth. Fortunately, we continue to see really strong cash flow to be able to support that CapEx. And again, I think it's reflective of the growth opportunities we see in the market.
Sam Hazen: And Bill, as we mentioned on the last call, we have acquired some land for future expansion in some of these fast-growing markets that we serve, and that's put some upward pressure on our capital spending. But we believe those are long-term good decisions for us.
Operator: The next question comes from Jason Cassorla with Citi Group.
Jason Cassorla: Yes. Great. Just wanted to ask a little bit more on the labor front. Thinking about all the efforts and programs you put in place contributing to the better turnover and hiring trends, I guess, is there a way to help frame what inning you're in as it relates to these efforts? Where do you like to see some of the outputs on turnover retention kind of move to? Or any other thoughts on the labor front and the trajectories there?
Sam Hazen: Yes. This is Sam. Thank you for that question. As I mentioned, we have invested very heavily in our people agenda over the past few years. We've increased our capacity within our recruiting function. Our recruiting efforts are yielding strong hiring, and we believe that will continue on into the latter half of the year. Our retention efforts with respect to responding to our employees' needs so that they have the necessary resources and tools to be effective in their day-to-day jobs, we're getting better at that. That's helping turnover.  Turnover is approaching pre-pandemic levels, especially in the nursing area. We are a few points above pre-pandemic. But if you annualize the second quarter turnover, it would suggest less than that. So we're encouraged by that, and we do believe we have opportunities to continue improvement in that area. With contract labor, as Bill mentioned, we expect to see improvements as we move through the last half of the year. And then I'm very excited about our workforce development initiatives. We continue to invest heavily in Galen College of Nursing. They're expanding each quarter, it seems, into new markets and establishing new relationships and new opportunities for people and for our company. And then we're also investing in our -- what we're calling our Centers for Clinical Advancement, which is our ongoing clinical education for our people so that they can upskill their capabilities and competencies and put them in a position to either deliver better care or grow in their own individual career. So what inning are we in? We're in the middle innings in some of the areas. And so we will wait to see how the latter half of the year plays out. But all in all, I think tremendous results. We're very competitive, we believe, across the organization with our compensation and benefit programs. And as I mentioned earlier, we've been able to navigate through these difficult periods and maintain margins. I think our labor costs -- again, if you just look at 2019 as a proxy, our labor cost in 2023 are below as a percent of revenue 2019. And again, that's in the very -- in the face of a very difficult labor market.
Operator: The next question comes from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.
Jamie Perse: Can you comment on seasonality expectations for the third quarter? Anything beyond normal seasonality from a headwind or tailwind perspective that we should be thinking about? And I think normally, revenue is down slightly and EBITDA down maybe mid-single digits to high single digits. Is that the right way to be thinking about the third quarter? And anything in July that's informing that? And then there was an earlier question on backlog that may not have been fully answered. I'd love your thoughts on that as well.
Sam Hazen: We mentioned at the end of the fourth quarter that we were starting to see normal seasonality patterns materialize. And we've seen that so far through the first half of this year, and we think that will continue on into the second half of this year. The third quarter is not as strong as the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is always the strongest quarter of the year for us given the outpatient activity and deductibles and so forth. And so we think the third and fourth quarter will be similar in patterns to pre-pandemic seasonality. And that's what's reflected in our guidance.
Operator: And the next question will come from Steven Valiquette. Your line is open.
Steve Valiquette: So I guess as a follow-up to just some of these prior questions on the labor and commercial rate update. There was some conjecture for HCA that the company didn't have quite as many commercial payer contracts up for renewal for fiscal '23 to capture some better rates for elevated labor costs, which you had more coming up for renewal in '24. Now that the noise levels kind of died down somewhat here in mid-23 on overall labor cost pressure versus -- certainly versus 12, 15 months ago, I guess the question is do you still have confidence to potentially capture potentially slightly better than average commercial rate updates for fiscal '24? Is labor pressure maybe still being the key variable within those discussions? Or are those going to be a little bit tougher now given that some of the pressure is subsided. Just want to get your kind of latest thoughts around that.
Sam Hazen: Well, this is Sam. Bill indicated that we're 70% contracted on '24 around our targeted escalation objective. Labor costs, as you mentioned, are moderating some. Yes, there's still inflationary pressures underneath it, as one would expect. Now we have physician cost pressures with respect to pro fees. And our belief is that, that will have to be paid for by someone. And so that will become a new factor in our thinking and our justification for appropriate price increases. So our cost are not just one category. We have multiple categories, as you can see on the income statement. And all of that factors into our considerations when we're negotiating.
Operator: And the next question will come from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research.
Joshua Raskin: Were there any meaningful differences in the payer mix on the outpatient side, an obvious focus on Medicare and specifically Medicare Advantage volumes. And are you seeing anything in the Medicare market that would support higher levels of demand than we saw last quarter or the quarter before, anything that you feel like is inflecting?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Josh, when I look at kind of the admissions versus adjusted admissions between the payer categories, they're comparable. Our Medicare adjusted admissions were up 5%. Our managed care adjusted admissions were up 5%, as we mentioned earlier, fueled by emergency room growth. So I think the trends are pretty comparable among the payer categories. And that's strengthening payer mix, that's, I think, positive trends for us. So nothing else underneath the outpatient area that I would distinguish, other than we continue to see good commercial ER traffic. Our commercial outpatient was up pushing close to 4% as well. So again, I think they're pretty comparable in terms of the general trends we're seeing.
Sam Hazen: I would say, Bill, just to put a little bit of color on the outpatient. Our commercial outpatient revenue growth is clearly outpacing our Medicare outpatient revenue growth. Some of the adjusted admissions are influenced by some of the calculations, if you will. But we are seeing really solid commercial outpatient revenue growth, again, influenced by the ER, influenced by surgeries, which are represented by roughly 50% to 55% commercial. So good growth there. And all of that yields solid commercial revenue growth.
Operator: There are no further questions. At this time. Mr. Frank Morgan, I turn the call back over to you.
Frank Morgan: Bailey, thank you so much for your help today. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week. And I'm around this afternoon if we can answer any additional questions you might have. Thank you very much. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-21 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.
Frank Morgan: Good morning and welcome to everyone on today’s call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then we will take a few questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today’s call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today’s press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning’s call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today’s release. This morning’s call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Alright. Thank you, Frank, and good morning. Thank you for joining our call. The operational momentum we had at the end of the last year continued into the first quarter of 2023. The company produced solid earnings that reflected strong demand for our services and improvements in our operating costs in particular contract labor expenses. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share excluding losses on sales of facilities grew by almost 20% to $4.93. Adjusted EBITDA grew close to 8%. Same facility volumes across the company were strong in the first quarter, admissions grew 4.4% year-over-year. Non-COVID admissions were up 12%. Our inpatient business continued to be supported by strong acuity and a favorable payer mix. Inpatient surgeries increased 3.6%. Same facility equivalent admissions increased 7.5%. This was driven by emergency room visits, which grew 10% and outpatient surgeries, which grew 5%. Other outpatient categories also grew including outpatient cardiology procedures, which increased 7%. The demand increase was broad-based across most of the company's footprint and service lines contributing to same facility revenue growth of 5%, as compared to the prior year. With respect to our people agenda, we saw continued improvements across virtually all metrics. The improvement in turnover rates accelerated from the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter close to pre-pandemic levels. Registered nurse hiring also improved in the quarter. Hiring increased almost 19%, compared to the previous four quarter average. These positive results helped reduce contract labor cost 21%, compared to last year. We continue to invest in our people through compensation programs, increased training and innovative care models. We believe these programs advanced our capabilities to provide high quality care to our patients. Once again, our colleagues demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt and deliver value across all stakeholder groups. I want to thank them for their dedication, their hard work, and their overall effectiveness. During the quarter, we continued to experience periodic capacity constraints that prevented us from fully operating our capacity. As compared to the fourth quarter, instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals declined 25% and represented 1.5% of total admissions in the quarter, which was down from 2% in the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with this improved trend it still remains above pre-pandemic levels. Close with this, we remain encouraged by the backdrop of strong demand that we saw in our markets. We intend to maintain our disciplined approach to executing our strategic and capital allocation plans as we push through the rest of this year. And lastly, we believe the investments we are making in our network, our people and our technology will provide us with the necessary resources to improve our services and provide high quality care to our patients. Given the strong results in the quarter and the favorable factors we expect with demand, you will see that we have increased our guidance for the year. With that, I'll turn the call to Bill for more details.
Bill Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $3.17 billion, as compared to $2.94 billion in the prior year. As noted in our release, in the first quarter of this year, we recorded an increase in revenues of $145 million related to resolving certain disputed claims with a commercial payer that covered a six-year period. In the prior year quarter, we recorded an additional $244 million of revenues and $90 million of expenses that related to the Texas directed payment program for an earlier period. I will also note, as it relates to prior year comparisons, we still were experiencing high level of COVID volumes in the first quarter of 2022. COVID admissions accounted for 9.7% of admissions last year, compared to about 3% this year. In addition, in the prior year quarter, we recognized approximately $190 million of COVID-related support payments versus about $30 million in this year's first quarter. Sam highlighted our positive volume metrics in the quarter and this was coupled with good payer mix and case mix trends. Same facility managed care and other admissions grew 4.2% during the quarter, when compared to the prior year and non-COVID managed care admissions grew 11.3% versus the prior year. Non-COVID case mix improved just under 1%, as compared to both prior year and sequentially from the fourth quarter. This contributed to our non-COVID inpatient revenue per admission increasing 2.2%, as compared to the first quarter of last year. We remain pleased with our team's management of operating cost even with the backdrop of higher inflation. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.3% in the quarter. Labor cost as a percentage of revenue improved both sequentially and when compared to the prior year and our supply costs continue to trend favorably as well. We have discussed previously other operating expenses have been subject to some inflationary cost pressures and increased approximately 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue, when compared to the prior year. So let me speak to some cash flow and capital allocation metrics as they remain a key part of our long-term growth and value creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations increased $458 million in the quarter from $1.35 billion in the prior year to $1.8 billion this year. Capital spending was just under $1.2 billion. We paid $175 million in dividends and repurchased just under $850 million of our stock during the quarter. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio remains near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3 times to 4 times. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full-year 2023 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $62.5 billion and $64.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.75 billion and $5.16 billion. We expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.1 billion and $12.7 billion. And we expect full-year diluted earnings per share to range between $17.25 and $18.55. And lastly, we expect capital spending to approximate $4.6 billion during the year. I will mention that our updated capital spending guidance is based on opportunities we believe exist to continue to invest growth agenda, and it also considers some land acquisitions we are planning for future development. In addition, we are seeing some inflationary increases in construction costs that we have factored into our guidance as well. Finally, I will mention, in early April, we closed on a transaction to increase our ownership interest in the Valesco joint venture with Envision. We will consolidate this venture, beginning in the second quarter and expect the venture will generate approximately $1 billion of annual revenues with no material impact to adjusted EBITDA. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank, and we'll open it up for Q&A. We look forward to your questions.
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so that we may give as many as possible an opportunity in the queue to ask a question. Rob, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe obviously, there's a lot of positive trends this quarter, both on the volume side, as well as what you're seeing particularly expenses with labor. When you sit here and look at the rest of the year, I know your updated guidance and updated a little further than just the beat in the quarter. What are the variables that you see could swing either more positive or negative? Are there open questions with respect to how labor trends the rest of the year? Or how volume trends the rest of the year? Or maybe some other metric that I'm not highlighting that you see as putting you at different points within the range, or offering variability? Can you maybe flash that out a little further?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. A.J., this is Bill. I'll start and then Sam can add in. I think as we said in our comments, we believe there is momentum that we're seeing in the market. We saw that late ‘22, but we are fortunate that continued into the first quarter. We continue to see good volume expectations in the market. You saw our same-store admissions. Our non-COVID volume was pretty robust, emergency room activity remains busy. So we feel reasonably positive on our volume outlook that we've given. Our revenue per unit, we're pleased with. We're pleased with the payer mix trends in acuity and case mix. They are stable and maintained in the levels that we anticipated. And then on the cost side, we believe the teams have managed cost very well. We knew that labor improved throughout ‘22. Obviously, first quarter of last year was a high mark -- high watermark for us in labor, so we're pleased with where it is today. We hope there's continued improvement to be made, especially around the utilization of contract labor. And so generally, we're feeling pretty good about the cost metrics. There are some inflationary cost trends we're seeing, as I mentioned in other operating that tends to show itself around our professional fees and some of those fixed-cost items that we don't have as much input over. But generally speaking, we think our revised guidance and our outlook reflects our view for the balance of the year.
A.J. Rice: Okay.
Bill Rutherford: Thanks, A.J.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Securities. Your line is open.
Whit Mayo: Hey, thanks. I was just wondering if you guys could unpack some of the growth that you're seeing in outpatient surgeries between the ASCs and HOPD, and maybe comment on any particular pockets of strength or weakness across some of those surgical service lines? And it's kind of a corollary to this question two is just the supply cost look very good even with the surgical growth. So if you could maybe elaborate on that dynamic, that would be helpful. Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Whit, this is Sam, Thank you for your question. We had strong activity in both settings. Our surgical volumes in our hospital outpatient units were up actually slightly more than what was inside of our ambulatory surgery centers. Across all service categories within both settings, we saw really solid volume growth. So it was broad-based, as I mentioned in my comments. We continue to invest in both. We have a more significant investment in our ambulatory surgery center development pipeline with a number of new developments, as well as some possible acquisitions that are complementary to the networks that we have across the company. So we're really pleased with our surgical activity. We are also very pleased with our inpatient surgical activity, as we've seen growth in both our emergency surgeries, as a result of our emergency room activity, as well as elective surgeries across different disciplines. The only category that was down actually our C-sections where we didn't have as much obstetric volume as we did in other parts of our business. And so if you normalize for that dynamic, we were actually up more significantly in the more acute categories of our service lines. So very solid result for us from a surgical volume standpoint. Our supply costs have continued to perform incredibly well. We have a great supply chain capability in our company, and we utilize it to leverage best practices, contracting, logistics, inventory management and so forth. And we continue to maintain even with increased acuity, increased surgical activity, good metrics around our supply cost.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the labor side. I think you said temp labor costs were down 21% year-over-year. Can you confirm that for me? And then just give us a little color in terms of the percentage of hours -- nursing hours that came from temp labor -- you know, temp labor as a percentage of SWB or temp labor as a percentage of SWB dollars. And anything else, kind of, in terms of trends that you're expecting in temp labor through the year that's implied in guidance? Where do you expect to come out-of-the year on some of those metrics? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Thanks, Justin. This is Bill. So yes, I'll confirm, our contract labor was down about 20% year-over-year. And again, we'll continue to be pleased with the trends in there. It's really rooted in the fact that our recruitment is up and turnover is down, so a lot of effort in that front. For the quarter, our contract labor was about 7.1% of our SWB. That compares to about 9.5% last year, and we were running mid-7s through the last half of ‘22, so good trends. You know, as a contract labor as a percent of hours was about 10.3%, where this time last year, we were 11.5%, almost 11.6%. So again, continued improvement in that area, really just rooted by a lot of efforts we have in the recruitment and retention. As we go through the year, we hope we'll continue to see favorable trends in that I hope and we can get in that 6.5% to 7% by the time we finish this year. So a lot of the effort continues by the teams to focus on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Ben Hendrix: Thank you. Could you comment a little further on the same-facility revenue per admission and the equivalent admission comps? It looks like maybe lower year-over-year rates in the outpatient volume offset inpatient rate growth. Perhaps you could flush out the dynamics there for the first quarter and how that could play out for the balance of the year. Thank you.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. I'll make a first step, Ben. I think, first, you have to recognize on the year-over-year comparisons, the COVID activity has a significant influence on the year-over-year comparisons. When our COVID emissions went from 9.7% last year to 3%, and COVID revenue per admission runs much higher than our non-COVID, is really influencing the as reported. So why in my prepared remarks, I talked about our non-COVID revenue per admission was 2.2% growth. We've seen sequential improvement in case mix. I think overall, I'd say we're pleased with where the performance is and our acuity in our payer mix and the revenue yield we have when we look at sequentially especially on that. So that was the main thing affecting the as reported, was the COVID volume. When we exclude COVID, we're really pleased with the revenue per unit ramps. Outpatient growth was heavy during the quarter, driven, as we talked about, with the emergency room. So that is influencing the per equivalent admission statistics while we broke down the per admission as well. But again, very pleased with the outpatient growth demand that we're seeing as well as the inpatient. So we're pleased with the top line metrics that we're seeing.
Ben Hendrix: Just as a quick follow-up. Can you parse out the degree to which your -- the acuity that you're seeing is just kind of normalization in terms of admission patterns versus kind of some of the investments you've made to expand your network capabilities? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: It's hard to parse it out. I mean it's all-inclusive. I mean, obviously, with a good surgical volume that we had that helped fuel that. We do continue to see a recovery of demand in the marketplace, but we continue to invest in growing our service offerings and our higher acuity services. So it's hard to parse out and attribute that from one or the other. But both I think are factors and the trends we're seeing.
Sam Hazen: Yes. And Bill, I think it's important to understand that our acuity or our case-mix index, the composite view of that is holding strong and actually up over 2019 when you consider we've lost a really high case mix component in total joint surgery. So I think that speaks to the underlying acuity mix within our remaining inpatient portfolio. We also had total joint surgery growth when you look at inpatient and outpatient again in the quarter. But nonetheless, those cases are now in the outpatient setting and out of our inpatient mix, but yet, we've been able to sustain a really strong acuity mix in total. And that's due to again, program development as Bill alluded to specific efforts in certain markets and certain facilities to advance their clinical capabilities. And it's yielding what we hoped. Next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Your line is open.
Gary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. One of my favorite expressions is when Sam starts talking about EBITDA clearance rates. So I was disappointed not to hear that catchphrase this morning, but otherwise, really solid quarter. My question is about commercial rate cycle. I think with all the moving parts with COVID, even when we see the Q, it's going to be hard to sort of tease out what's happening there. So just wanted to see if you could just update us on how you're doing on your commercial rate renewals. Is there any material activity on off-cycle renewals? Does this $145 million settlement say anything about the environment in terms of how you're positioned with the payers? Or is it just completely sort of a one-off? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: So, Gary, not to disappoint, our EBITDA clearance in the quarter was 36%. So that's a really good metric for us recognizing operating leverage in the face of really inflation. So it sort of proves the model when we can drive activity into our facilities where we have embedded fixed cost, we're able to turn that into earnings in a very productive way. Again, it speaks to our management team's ability to manage their operations effectively. We're pleased with what's going on in our payer contracting cycles. As we said, we're targeting mid-single-digit increases, and we are achieving that in most circumstances. And I think the payers recognize again the pressures in the marketplace for providers and are allowing, sort of, responsible increases. So we are roughly contracted for 2023. We're 93% of the way there. We're about two-thirds of the way through 2024 and about a quarter of the way through 2025. And at this particular point in time, we're able to maintain the trend that we feel is necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances. The one payer settlement that we talked about, we have processes in place in our Parallon organization, which we believe is a best-in-class revenue cycle capability. And through their efforts and through our support efforts of other components of our business, we were able to resolve some claims that we felt were underpaid in previous years, and those payments were recognized in particular quarter. I don't know that it's reflective of anything in the marketplace other than the specifics around that particular circumstance. I will say that we are focused on making sure that we have the right controls in place, the right relationships in place and the right procedures around ensuring that we get the reimbursement that we have earned. And if there are underpayments or denials that we think are not appropriate, then we will make sure that we work our way through those disputes to get to the answer that we think is appropriate for the company. And I wouldn't say that's anything new necessarily, but it continues to be an ongoing opportunity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Pito Chickering: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Any color on how full-time nurse wage inflation is tracking so far this year versus your expectations? And are you seeing any competitors increase their wages again in 2023? Or is it pretty stable at this point? And on the non-nursing staff, where is that tracking? And can you reflect us on what you assume for nursing and non-nursing wage inflation for 2023 in your guidance?
Sam Hazen: Peto, this is Sam. I think our overall compensation per hour across all aspects of our workforce are trending where we expected them to trend this year. And we're pleased with the progress. And that's in the face of us making some fairly significant increases over the latter part of ‘22, and we continue to make modest increases in certain market circumstances in ‘23, responding to new data or new understandings around what's happening from one market to the other. As I mentioned on our call, our turnover was down. Our nursing turnover was approaching pre-pandemic levels. We were running about 15% -- 14.5% to 15% in 2018 and 2019. We're running about 17%, when you look at the last six months annualized. So a very good trend happening, and we think it's, again, a factor of the macro trends, some of our specific actions around compensation program efforts to really increase resourcing and capabilities for our nurses and other caregivers. So we're really encouraged by the efforts of our teams, the recruitment metrics that we're seeing and where we are competitively in the market. Will there be a market here or there we have to adjust to as we move through the year? Yes. We believe that's factored into our guidance appropriately, and we should be able to manage through those changes as the year progresses.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Joshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. Appreciate taking the question. Could you speak to the increase in CapEx guidance for the year? And I'm curious if you accelerated anything specifically in 1Q as that came in a little bit above where we were thinking? I'm specifically interested in the types of projects that are getting funded and especially the ones that have been that weren't contemplated maybe three months ago? And then lastly, I heard real estate purchases. I'm assuming those are for new inpatient hospital facilities over time.
Sam Hazen: Yes. This is Sam. Thank you for the question. We have a number of communities that we serve where we believe, over time, we're going to need to add to our hospital network, we're obviously adding significantly to our outpatient network. We have approximately 2,500 outpatient facilities that support our 180 or so hospitals across our communities. But we believe that over time, as our communities continue to grow, and we believe that's one of the differentiating attributes of HCA, that are -- we're in great markets that have great growth prospects in and of themselves, before we get to share gain possibilities in those markets, that is going to require us to build out some new hospital facilities. We do have a new hospital opening in -- or under construction in San Antonio -- actually two in San Antonio. As we speak, but San Antonio is one of those markets where we have uniquely high occupancy. That market, for example, we run approximately 90% occupancy, and we think it's better for us to open up new hospitals as opposed to keep adding on in every circumstance in that particular community. But we do own land in Austin, Texas for new hospitals, we own land in Dallas for new hospitals. We just recently purchased in the first quarter land for new hospitals in Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. We have land for new hospitals in a number of Florida markets. So that's part of what you're seeing in our capital spending, is that we are acquiring land for future network development. In addition to that, we have significantly advanced our outpatient facility development. That doesn't put too much pressure on our capital spending, but there are some elements of it that are in the increased guidance. And then finally, I think it's important for everybody to understand, we are still in a situation where we have a lot of facilities that have high levels of occupancy. In the first quarter, the company ran approximately 73% to 74% occupancy in its inpatient facilities. And we need to have sufficient capacity as we build up our staffing over time. We need physical capacity to accommodate what we believe to be the demand for health care. So the projects are really mixed among those three things: land acquisitions for future hospital development; outpatient network development; and then relieving capacity constraints on the existing platform of facilities that we have today.
Bill Rutherford: And Josh, this is Bill. I'll add, we obviously can accommodate that increasing capital within the resources we're generating and within our overall capital allocation philosophies that we have. And we also continue to see really strong returns on invested capital. So we have confidence that these investments will continue to generate growth for us into the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning. Bill, maybe just a question on how we should be thinking about the moving pieces or considerations for the second quarter? I know you called out the envisioned contribution to revenue and then maybe the New Orleans Hospital. But anything that we should be thinking about just sequentially in year-over-year? Thank you.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Brian, nothing material. I mean, once we kind of anniversary the high COVID volume, which is principally first quarter, second quarter of last year, we began to see the start of normalization. Obviously, we're coming off some continued high labor costs in the first quarter. We saw some improvement in the second quarter and obviously improvement as we went through the balance of the year. So I can't say there's anything material, I can call out, especially one quarter to the next. We typically wouldn't do that. But for the balance of the year, now that we've got the majority of the high COVID behind us in terms of the year-over-year comparisons, things should begin to normalize for the most part.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok from UBS. Your line is open.
Andrew Mok: Hi, good morning. You provided some breakeven metrics on Medicaid redeterminations in the past. Hoping you could provide an updated view on how you expect that to play out over the next 18 to 24 months? And what sort of impact that could have on near and intermediate-term operating results? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Thanks. I mean, obviously, this is an area we continue to pay attention to. We've got a fairly formalized approach inside of the company. We haven't seen any impact yet as those redeterminations are just beginning to occur, but we are keeping very close to state plans. We've also made outreach to our Medicaid patients to help them look at alternative coverage in the event they find themselves displaced to Medicaid. We continue to be encouraged with some of the third-party studies that we read that a relatively high percentage of those individuals potentially qualify for employer-sponsored coverage or through enhanced subsidies coverage within the health insurance marketplace. So we are staying very close to that. We are increasing our efforts to help people identify coverage that are available to them, trying to work with states and other community agencies where necessary to help people land coverage. So too early to be able to quantify what the impact of that may be. But ultimately, I believe when people can find coverage in the exchanges or through their employer. We wouldn't really anticipate any material downside, and hopefully, there could be some upside benefit to that over the long run.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Your line is open.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Interested if you could talk about how you're thinking about the sustainability of the surgical growth trends over the balance of the year, both in inpatient and outpatient. And interested if -- was there any catch-up just as COVID really diminished in the first quarter? Or do you see those types of growth trends are sustainable over the course of the year?
Bill Rutherford: We're looking -- one, we're pleased with the trends. It's hard to parse exactly the contribution of that. I think overall, we're pleased with the demand and the activity we see in the market. We continue to see -- believe that we're going to return to normal historical volume patterns. And if that does show itself, we should see continued growth in both inpatient and outpatient surgical volume. We continue to invest in our outpatient footprint. That should help drive reasonable outpatient surgical growth. Our program development in the inpatient side should help continue to show good inpatient surgical growth as well. So we'll just have to see that. I think, typically, we would see 1% to 2% type of surgical growth. And as the year goes on, hopefully, we'll continue to see that.
Sam Hazen: Yes. And just to add to that, Bill. I think as we continue to increase our staffing capacity, it also affects our surgical capacity, because we do have instances we're not able to open all of our operating rooms as sufficiently as we would prefer also. And so as our labor situation continues to get better, we think that will allow us to open up more surgical capacity, and we believe the demand in the market is still there. So we're encouraged by where we are with our surgical volumes, and we think we have some things that should prop it up, if you will, as we move through the year with our staffing agenda and our human resource strategies.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Your line is open.
Lance Wilkes: Actually, that's a perfect lead into my question. Could you talk a little bit about your outlook for staff growth? And in particular, obviously, you had the shift from temporary to permanent which has been great. Can you talk about how your staff has grown or maybe registered nurse staff or something like that over the last year? And then as you're looking forward, are there any particular impediments to continued levels of growth?
Sam Hazen: Well, our total headcount was up around 2% when you look at this first quarter against last first quarter, And let me make sure that -- actually, it's more like 3% when you factor out the two lane divestiture. So we're up 3% quarter-over-quarter, which is obviously solid improvement in the market. As we've mentioned in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of last year, we were starting to see some momentum with our hiring, some momentum with our retention programs and so forth. And that's carried through into the first quarter really well. I think our overall hiring was up 13% or something like that. But in the quarter compared to the running average, it was up 19% and that's mostly in nursing. I don't know that it will run that hot as we move through the rest of the year nor will we need it to run that hot as we move through the rest of the year. So our efforts with our recruitment, our efforts with retention will continue. We're encouraged by other programs that we have to support our people and put them in the best position to succeed and deliver high-quality care. We have a significant investment we're making in clinical education. Our Galen School of Nursing continues to grow, and we're really encouraged by what those programs will do for our facilities and our people over time. So those things are all part and parcel to a very comprehensive effort to make sure we have the right amount of staff, they're supplied with the right technology and resources to deliver high-quality care and they can be successful in growing our company. So we're pretty encouraged by where we are.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Calvin Sternick from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Calvin Sternick: Thanks for the questions. Wanted to ask about capacity. I know you said 1.5% for the quarter but still above pre-pandemic levels and labor improving. So just want to get a sense, what are some of the other key variables for getting the declination rate back down to historical levels? And where do you think you can get to by year-end? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Well, hopefully, we get back to pre-pandemic levels. We benchmarked a lot of our metrics against where we were in 2019, so that we can have a comparison of, sort of, more normalized environment. But obviously, our leverage, and as I just mentioned, is very important to our abilities to open up all of our bed capacity and surgical capacity and so forth. Even in our emergency room capacity sometimes can be constrained, because of staffing levels and such. I think it will continue to get better as we went through the first quarter, March was better than January as an example. So that's a positive trend within the quarter. We're hopeful that, that will sustain itself as we move through the balance of the year. And as we look at some of our hiring and the timing of that hiring, that should line up with some continued improvement as we sequentially move through the year. So those are the main things. Some -- we have capital that will come online over the course of the year, as we always do. That will help in certain circumstances. But I think the most important variable is staff and getting sufficient staff into our facilities, allowing us to open up our beds and so forth appropriately.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.
Steven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So really one main question here. When looking at some of the hospital-related volume commentary from medical device companies over the past week or two, at least one of them suggested from their view that hospital volumes were the strongest in January and February, then normalized in March. And I know no one really likes questions on the monthly performance. So really just my more high-level question is if you could just comment on whether or not the momentum in your overall operations was generally pretty consistent throughout the quarter? And then also, is the full-year ‘23 guidance increase meant to reflect mainly just the upside witnessed in 1Q? And is the rest of the year outlook is generally unchanged from your prior view? Or should we all expect strong momentum from the first quarter to continue into 2Q? Just kind of an all of thoughts around all that for just the overall operations would be helpful. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Well, again, I think we've seen momentum on there. So yes, the guidance is, I think, is referenced by a few others, principally the performance in the first quarter that we saw. But as we look at volume through the quarter, I think it was pretty consistent on there. We're feeling positive with some of the trends we're seeing, it’s hard to call exactly what may happen and exactly what period they will. But we continue to see good demand in the markets. We continue to add our capacity, continue to be able to serve that. So we think we've incorporated all reasonable assumptions into the guidance going forward. And that's where we stand right now and we'll continue to monitor as the year goes on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Jason Cassorla: Great, thanks. You noted favorable payer mix in the quarter. I was hoping you can give us a sense on commercial -- on core commercial volume growth split out between exchange-related volumes and then just pure commercial. And perhaps if you saw in 1Q or are currently seeing any commercial volume pull forward perhaps ahead of potential coverage changes later this year? Or do you think that commercial volume trend is just more broad-based? Any color on that would be very helpful. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. I mean, as I mentioned in my comments, our non-COVID commercial volume was up a little over 11%. So obviously, that's a stat we're very pleased. We're very pleased with the exchange enrollment. We saw really good enrollment across our states. Some of the publicly released data that you've seen, we've seen exchange enrollment in Florida, up 18%, Texas up close to 30%. And that [Technical Difficulty] pretty well with where we would expect exchange volume to be. Our exchange volume just year-over-year was up, what, 19% or so for the quarter. It's hard to make some of those comparisons pure on the non-exchange because COVID has such an impact on that. But if I back up and look at the non-COVID growth of managed care at 11, it is still pretty strong. And even overall, we were up 4%. So again, we're thinking that there's good payer mix will continue, good demand. We still see basically full employment in most of our markets. So we'll see where that plays out. But we are pleased with the health insurance exchange activity that we're seeing across the markets.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Sarah James: Thank you. I'm trying to piece together a few of the comments that you made on contract labor. You talked about getting down to about 6.5% to 7% exiting the year. Is that in line with what you've been thinking before? I thought you guys were a little bit lower. And then how do you think about reinvesting the savings of that? So how much is going to wage inflation versus actually increasing headcount? Or is any of it falling to the bottom line as sort of a margin relief?
Bill Rutherford: Well, I mean, there's a lot of moving parts in our labor side. And obviously, our focus has been reducing the utilization of our premium labor, and that has allowed us to continue to invest in our employed workforce. And we continue to invest in our existing employees both through wage rates, as well as hiring that was spoken about earlier on the call. And so when we roll it all up, we kind of look at the overall impact. And yes, we are fortunate that as we've been able to reduce contract labor, that's allowed us to make the investments into our employed workforce. I think that will continue. I think our commentary around our expectations has been reasonably consistent. If you looked at where we ran kind of pre-COVID, it was probably in that 6% range. We think we can continue to make progress on that. So it's fairly consistent. But again, we are investing much of the benefit of contract labor back into our existing employees.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on another question. You mentioned having a pretty decent amount of visibility on 2024 contracting at this point. I mean, can you just remind us how the two-thirds, compared to where you might have been in a more typical pre-COVID environment? And I think you also alluded that the commercial rate dynamics continuing to be acknowledged by payers at the same general magnitude. Just want to confirm if that was what you meant by those comments? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: I'm not sure I understood the second part of that question. But the first part of the question, we're, like I said, running mid-single-digits on our renewed contracts. We were running 3.5 or so prepandemic with our commercial contracting. So it is up a little bit. Again, it's reflective of, I think, the overall inflationary environment that most organizations find themselves. But we think it's a responsible ask and it's been received reasonably well by the payers that we've renewed. What was the second question?
Bill Rutherford: Well, I think the other one was around the percentage of our contracts that are completed for '24? Is it consistent with where its historical.
Sam Hazen: Oh, yes, it is.
Bill Rutherford: And if it is consistent with where we would have historically been.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jamie Perse: Hey, thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question about the procedure shift to outpatient. First, can you help us quantify what the headwind from that shift has been to revenue and EBITDA over the last couple of years? And then two, categories like knees and hips, so a little bit more homogenous, how do we think about the shift of categories like cardiology? You mentioned that was up 7% in the outpatient setting in the quarter. Are there big categories in cardiology that are analogous to total joints that you think are a big category that is amenable to that shift out patients that we should be thinking about impacting the transition in the near-term? Thank you.
Sam Hazen: We don't see any particular procedural category facing the same type of pressure as total joints did. I think our company is somewhere around 80% of our total joints today are done as an outpatient with 20% done as an inpatient. That was reversed pre-pandemic. So we've absorbed all of that. And it was a headwind with respect to a P&L impact over this time period. The rest of the categories are not as discrete as total joints. And in cardiac, particularly, a large piece of our cardiac volumes today are already in the outpatient setting. And so we don't anticipate anything in that particular category shifting like total joints have shifted. We've seen some shift over time in spine, and that's more incremental than it is holistic like total joints. We've seen some in cardiac over the years. We've seen some with our robotics platform. Those continue, sort of, on the margin. They're not structurally repositioning like total joints did. And so our company has effectively navigated that transition. Again, we have a multifaceted offering for patients and physicians, both in our facilities, outpatient within our facilities, ambulatory surgery centers so forth. And that's -- one of those settings is the right setting for just about every patient. And I think our organization has been able to grow as a result of that multifaceted offering. And our total joints, like I said earlier, are actually up year-over-year and they were up last year, compared to the previous year, so we've seen good growth in our orthopedic programs, and we continue to work with our surgeons and our service line leaders to advance our capabilities as well.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Frank Morgan. I turn the call back over to you for some final closing remarks.
Frank Morgan: Rob, thank you for your help today, and thanks for everyone for joining the call. We hope you have a great weekend. I'm around this afternoon. If we can answer any additional questions you might have for this. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the HCA Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.
Frank Morgan: Good morning and welcome to everyone on today’s call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then we will take a few questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today’s call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today’s press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning’s call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today’s release. This morning’s call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Alright. Good morning and thank you for joining the call. We finished 2022 as expected with pre-pandemic seasonality demand norms driving solid volume growth. Additionally, we continue to see progress with our labor agenda. These factors helped produce solid earnings in the fourth quarter that were consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged by this outcome and believe this operational momentum should position us well for 2023. 2022 was a tale of two halves, with the first half being more about winding down from the previous 2 years of intense COVID activity and responding to the resulting challenges. The second half was more about normalization, which included strong demand and an improving labor market. Once again, I believe our people have demonstrated an impressive capability in the face of these dynamic forces and delivered for our patients, the communities we serve and other stakeholders. Healthcare people in general are unique, but I believe HCA Healthcare people are even more special. I’ll often refer to them as can-do people, and again, this past year, I think they proved it. I want to thank them for their hard work and everything they do each and everyday for our company. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong in the fourth quarter. Admissions grew 3% year-over-year. Non-COVID admissions increased in excess of 5%. Equivalent admissions were up 5.4%, with impressive growth of 11% in the emergency room. Most of our other volume categories had solid growth metrics in the quarter also. The payer mix and acuity levels in the quarter remained at favorable levels. These factors produced revenue growth against a difficult comparison of 3% in the quarter. With respect to our people agenda, we were pleased with the improvements we saw in key metrics. Turnover numbers for registered nurses were down 26% in the fourth quarter as compared to the previous four quarters’ average. Our turnover rate is still higher than we want, but we believe it is better than the industry average. Employee engagement scores recovered to around pre-pandemic levels. Again, our engagement is above the industry average. Our recruiting teams continue to generate results for the company. Hiring increased 6% year-over-year in 2022. And lastly, we opened our seventh Galan College of Nursing School this year. With respect to labor costs during the quarter, we experienced stable labor cost per hour with utilization of contract labor declining. As we have detailed in the past, we have implemented a robust human resources plan. We executed well on it and expect to make further progress as we move into 2023. It remains a top organizational priority. Even with the progress, we continued this quarter to experience capacity constraints, creating situations where we were unable to deliver services in certain situations. Also in the quarter, we saw value from our portfolio optimization plan and closed two joint ventures with strategic partners; one was with our Sarah Cannon Research Institute, which we combined with McKesson’s cancer research entity. We believe the combination of these two entities will produce better cancer research and more clinical trials across the country, providing even more community-based resources for physicians and patients to fight this disease. The second co-venture is with our CoreTrust purchasing organization. We closed on a new partnership with Blackstone. We believe this new relationship can expand our ability to offer commercial purchasing and services solutions to a broader variety of customers. We believe both of these deals achieved our strategic objectives and connected us with better platforms for success in the future. We are excited to partner with both entities. We also implemented our capital plan for the year as expected, including redeploying the proceeds from these two new joint ventures. Bill will provide more details in his comments. And finally, we announced in the last quarter a significant leadership transition that we believe will position the organization better with responding timelier to market dynamics, while also strengthening the alignment of corporate functions to our strategy. The executives who are part of this transition are all proven HCA executives, they understand and appreciate our culture and they know how to execute. As we push ahead into 2023 and beyond, we believe the strong demand for healthcare services presents opportunity for HCA Healthcare in an otherwise challenging macro environment. We believe the company is well-positioned culturally, competitively and financially to capitalize. Our agenda next year will be focused on the following three areas. First, overcoming labor and capacity challenges. Again, we believe we have the appropriate initiatives in place to respond to these. Second, counter inflationary pressures. Again, we have numerous efforts in place to contend with these forces, while ensuring we continue to deliver high-quality outcomes to our patients. And third, accelerating growth with our winning plays. This agenda continues to leverage capital investments in outpatient facilities, clinical equipment for our physicians and service line expansion. On top of our 2023 agenda, we are also making investments in our long-term plan, which includes four primary elements: the first one is advancing our clinical systems and digital capabilities; second is transforming care models with innovative solutions; third is expanding our workforce development programs; and fourth, is investing capital in our networks to expand their offerings. These efforts are pressuring our results some in the current year, but we believe they are necessary in creating a platform for ultimately optimizing our networks so they can deliver even better patient care in the future. Let me close with this. The last 3 years have been an extraordinary experience for everyone at HCA Healthcare. There has been no rest nor retreat for our people and it was truly a challenge like no other. I strongly believe however that our Board, our management teams and our caregivers have shined through it all. We went into the pandemic with two priorities, to protect our people and to protect the organization so we could continue providing high-quality healthcare to the communities we serve. I believe strongly that we showed up, we delivered on these priorities and we did it the right way. I am proud of HCA Healthcare and I am even more proud of our people. The future for our company is even brighter because of the past 3 years and what we learned. Now we will move into 2023 and the years ahead with greater purpose, with a renewed agenda to drive growth and with more confidence in our ability to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. With that, I will turn the call to Bill and he will discuss the quarter’s results in more detail and our 2023 guidance.
Bill Rutherford: Okay. Thank you, Sam and good morning everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter and the year then discuss our ‘23 guidance. We finished the year with good volume metrics. Our fourth quarter same facility admissions increased 2.9% over the prior year. For the full year, our same-facility admissions were up 0.5%. Excluding COVID admissions, our same-facility admissions grew 5.4% in the quarter and were up 3.4% for the year. For the full year, COVID admissions accounted for 5.2% of our admissions versus 7.8% in the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 11.4% in the quarter as compared to the prior year and were up 7.6% for the full year. Our same-facility outpatient surgeries were up slightly in the quarter from the prior year, but increased 5.6% sequentially compared to the third quarter. Same-facility inpatient surgeries were basically flat as compared to the prior year. Both were impacted by 1 less business day in the quarter. Our same-facility revenue per equivalent admission was down 2.6% in the quarter from the prior year as this was influenced by the drop in COVID activity. Sequentially, our non-COVID revenue per equivalent admission increased approximately 3.7% as compared to the third quarter. Our case mix increased just under 2% sequentially from the third quarter and our payer mix remained stable as well. We remain pleased with our team’s management of operating costs even with the backdrop of higher inflation rates. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins were 20.5% in the quarter and right at 20% for the full year. We continue to focus on our labor plans and supporting our teams, while appropriately managing contract labor and premium pay programs. Our total labor cost as a percentage of revenue improved both sequentially and when compared to the prior year. In addition, our supply cost trends have remained very consistent during the year and we are pleased with these results. Other operating expenses have been subject to some inflationary cost pressures when compared to the prior year, but has run fairly consistent as a percent of revenue throughout 2022. Our cash flow and capital allocation are a key part of our long-term growth and value-creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion in 2022. Our capital spending was just under $4.4 billion for the year, which was slightly higher than our initial expectations due to some year end real estate and information technology purchases. We paid dividends of about $650 million and we repurchased $7 billion of our outstanding stock during the year. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3x to 4x. For full year 2022, we realized approximately $1.2 billion in proceeds from sales of facilities and healthcare entities. So, let me speak to our 2023 guidance for a moment. As noted in our release this morning, we are providing full year ‘23 guidance as follows. We expect revenues to range between $61.5 billion and $63.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.525 billion and $4.895 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $11.8 billion and $12.4 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $16.40 and $17.60. And we expect capital spending to approximate $4.3 billion during the year. So, let me provide some additional commentary on our guidance. Our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance is impacted by several governmental and policy changes. In 2022, we recognized approximately $280 million in COVID support mainly from DRG add-ons, removal of sequestration cuts and HRSA reimbursement for uninsured COVID patients. We expect very little revenue from these programs in 2023. Also, as discussed in our first quarter release, we recognized $244 million of revenues and $90 million of expenses related to the Texas directed payment program that was for the last 4 months of 2021. This program that started on September 1, ‘21 was not improved until the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we estimate the impact of the 340B related payment reductions to be between $50 million and $100 million. Adjusted for these items, the midpoint of our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance would be in the middle of our historical 4% to 6% growth expectations that we have had over time. Within our guidance, we expect our same facility equivalent admissions to grow approximately 2% to 3% and our revenue per equivalent admission to grow approximately 2%. Depreciation is estimated to be about $3.1 billion and interest expense is projected to be around $1.975 billion. Interest expense will be impacted by both higher rates and anticipated draws under our revolving credit facilities. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be about $278 million for the full year and cash flow from operations is estimated to range between $8.5 billion and $9 billion. Also noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program. This will be in addition to the approximate $1.5 billion remaining authorization we had under the previous program at the end of the year. In addition, our Board has declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.56 to $0.60 per share. With that, I will turn the call over to Frank and we will open it up for Q&A.
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. [Operator Instructions] Devin, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of numbers questions here. I appreciate all the detail you have given. So first, just all thinking about 2023, can you talk us a little bit about what you are expecting for labor expense and maybe delineate the cost on permanent labor versus hopefully the downward trend maybe give us ‘22 versus ‘23 million on labor? And then couple of things, exchanges and redetermination, right, exchange growth has been big redeterminations could be a tailwind at least according to our estimates. Curious what you have assumed there on payer mix and kind of impacts from that on 2023 guide as well? Thanks guys.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Justin, this is Bill. Let me start. So as it relates to labor cost, I think as a percentage of revenue, we will keep it on an as-reported basis, flat with where we ran for the full year of this year. We continue to expect improvement in the utilization and cost of contract labor as we go through the balance of the year. And so I think that’s a good output for us. Relative to payer mix, we think payer mix for now will mostly remain stable. We are encouraged with what we are seeing with the enrollment in the health insurance exchanges and we believe the enrollment in our states, are probably a little bit higher than what we see as a nation. And so we think we have contemplated that within the context of our overall range, but we are encouraged with some of the payer mix trends.
Operator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the outlook commentary and so forth. Maybe because you have got about a $600 million range on the EBITDA range you are looking at. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what are some of the swing factors? Do you see those mainly as top line swing factors that would get you to the high or low end or is there expense management, open questions in your mind? And specifically on the labor, you have got quite a bit of a decline in the contract labor from what you spent in ‘22 versus presumably the run-rate for ‘23. How much of that are you baking into the guidance versus how much are you saying you have got to redeploy to support permanent labor?
Sam Hazen: A.J., this is Sam. I think on the guidance, I mean, we have got 2.5%, I believe, on either side of the midpoint. The top side of that range I think is achievable if our volume and labor agenda happens maybe a little bit better than what we anticipate. The low side of that range would be greater inflationary pressures and maybe some more challenges in a tenuous labor market. Those are sort of the big variables, if you will, in the equation. I mean, it’s a fairly big number to begin with and again, the 2.5% range on either side of the midpoint we think is not unreasonable. So to consider it to be very wide seems maybe to not fully appreciate some of the variables inside of it. With respect to labor, yes, we have made significant investments in our people. We did that throughout last year mainly in the late summer, early fall, where we adjusted our wages to deal with movement in the market resulting from some visibility that we had with our overall competitive positioning. Some of the contract labor reductions that we expect and have already made even will be absorbed a little bit in those decisions, but we think the net of it is what Bill just alluded to, and that is that we can maintain our labor cost as a percent of revenue roughly around what we finished 2022 at. So that’s how we’re thinking about it. And again, we’re seeing positive metrics across the key dimensions of our labor agenda that is encouraging to us. And we believe we have more room to gain with our agenda, and we’re hopeful that, that will continue throughout 2023.
A.J. Rice: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with Cowen.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Two quick ones for me. Bill, I know you said contract labor came down again, but I didn’t catch if you disclosed the 4Q number. And then my other one was just also on your comment about the other OpEx line. I mean that’s still a line that on a per adjusted patient day basis is up in the double digits. So any help you can give us on thinking about modeling that for ‘23?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Gary. On contract labor for the quarter, we were down about 16% from where we ran in the fourth quarter of last year. So good improvement in that area. It represented roughly 7.8% of our total salary wages and benefits. We talked about given that number before. So again, solid trends in the fourth of this year compared to where we ran last year and especially where we ran in the first half of the year. Our other operating expenses, you’re right, are subject to some of the general inflationary increases that we’re seeing across the economy. When we think about utilities and insurance and, in addition, our professional fees areas, we’re seeing some higher single-digit cost growth in other operating expenses. Fortunately, if you look across the quarters for 2022, as a percentage of revenue, you’ll see our other operating expenses as a percent of revenue staying relatively and pretty consistent throughout the year. As we look forward to 2023, we do believe that’s an area that can continue to see some higher single-digit inflationary pressures, and we factored that in to our guidance going forward. Again, we think labor supplies will keep in line and hopefully below where our revenue growth is. But the other operating cost area is around utilities, insurance pro fees are going to continue to see some pressures, and we factor that into our guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.
Ben Hendrix: Hi, good morning. Thank you. With regard to capacity constraints, you mentioned last quarter missing out on 1% to 1.5% of total admissions in 3Q. Can you give us an update on where that stands now? And then maybe some more commentary on progress with your HR and case management initiatives and then the degree to which you expect those to help ease constraints and support your guidance this year? Thank you.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. Thank you for that. I mean we did, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, had some moments in the quarter where we were unable to receive transfers in or take certain patients into our facilities. And that was actually a little bit elevated over the third quarter. We had roughly, using this as the proxy, approximately 2% of our total admissions we were unable to take through our transfer centers and ahead to find those patients alternative solutions where we could. We were busier in the fourth quarter than we were in the third quarter, so that was part of it. But nonetheless, we still are seeing opportunities for us to improve the throughput through our case management initiatives, as you spoke to, continue to increase the head count in our facilities in order to take care of these patients. And we’re hopeful that those numbers will start to come down a little bit as we push into 2023.
Operator: Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with SVB Securities.
Whit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Sam, I wanted to go back to the long-term plan that you mentioned. You talked about advancing the transformation of care delivery models. Can you maybe elaborate more on that, sort of how that may be playing in the physician strategy, maybe a different view into working with MA plans or anything would be helpful? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Well, let me give you a little bit of a backdrop on our long-term thinking with in – and I think this going to help you understand why we are investing in these categories. First and foremost, we think we have just an incredible portfolio of communities that we serve. They are growing in and of themselves. So we have opportunities to invest in that growth. We think demand is going to grow in our markets. Aging baby boomers population growth chronic conditions, all those things unfortunately produce demand in some respect. And we think our portfolio is a little better than the national averages on that front. So we’ve got that as a backdrop. So there is opportunities, I’ll call it, outside the walls of HCA to invest in that natural growth in demand. The second piece that we believe exists is opportunities inside of HCA. We have what we call an economy of opportunities that exist across our 180 hospitals and 2,400 outpatient facilities that we have. And that opportunity is to use big data, use better clinical system capability and better analytics to support better care. And so our technology agenda, coupled with our care transformation agenda, is really about tapping into the economy of opportunity that exist inside our organization. So we think we have two sets of opportunities, outside to continue to grow market share and benefit from the growth in our markets, and then continued improvement in care delivery for better patient outcomes, more efficiency, better operational management in our hospitals by infusing machine learning, advanced analytics with our care transformation agenda. So our care transformation team is led by a physician and a clinical team with industrial engineers and other type of people who are big data analysts who are supporting evaluating great performance that we have inside our company and really studying the processes around those, or looking outside the company for better processes, better technologies, and, again, weaving that into our overall agenda for our long run. And we’re encouraged by that. We have a major initiative that we’re rolling out this year in our obstetrics unit, and we’re excited about the possibilities around that. On our clinical systems, we are actually in our alpha pilot on our clinical system upgrades. We will have a beta pilot later this year. This is a system that we will be able to push more information, standardized information into the cloud and start to turn that into actionable insights that, we believe, can help our patient outcomes. So we’re really excited about our long-run agenda. And again, it’s geared toward better patient care, but capitalizing on the opportunities inside the walls of HCA.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Pito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Focusing on the fourth quarter, you talked about 2% lower emissions via the transfers. Were those all surgeries? I’m just trying to understand why in-patient surgeries are so weak on easy comps, and why I didn’t see a bigger increase in outpatient surgeries. We’ve seen some med-tech companies report very strong U.S. surgical growth. So just trying to understand the delta? And also what are you seeing you grow in-patient surgeries and out-patient surgeries in 2023? Thanks so much.
Bill Rutherford: So Peter, this is Bill. I think our surgical volume, the most – the thing being pushed out was we had 1 less business day, 1 less surgical day, and so that could account for 1.5 points or 2 of that trend. And I don’t think there is any other trends that we observed in our out-patient or in-patient surgery or call out other than just 1 less operating day. Going forward, I would say that we would anticipate our surgical volume to reflect our longer term trends, which has historically been somewhere around that 2 point growth. And again, there is some variables that fluctuate on that, but that was the issue on the flat surgical volume for Q4, was nothing other than 1 less surgical day.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I appreciate you guys breaking out kind of how you thought about the core pricing in the quarter. Is there a way to do that in the 2023 guidance? Obviously, the COVID is a headwind 340B is a headwind, and then how to think about anything else that’s a moving piece there? I just want to understand the core trends in pricing, and then maybe talk a little bit about commercial rate growth of what you’re renegotiating today? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Kevin, let me start with that. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we are anticipating revenue per equivalent admission around 2%. That’s on an as-reported basis. Obviously, I called out some of those non-recurring revenue items we’ve had the benefit of in ‘22, we don’t expect to continue next year. If you adjust for those, that’d probably be pushing us towards closer to 3% number, which would be, historically, we would see 2% to 3% growth. So what really moves us back into our historical pricing trends, what we would see pre-COVID is just that we are having to jump over some of that loss of cohort. So that was a 2% guidance on a revenue per equivalent admission. If you adjust that, it’d be closer to 3%, which is in line with our long-term guidance. That’s contemplating both our Medicare rate updates with some improved commercial pricing that I think we’ve talked about in the past.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.
Ann Hynes: Hi, good morning. I know some of your peers have noted that physician outsourcing services especially on the ER is a pressure point for 2023. Are you seeing that? And if so, how much of a headwind is it to EBITDA? And secondly, just on the merchant turnover, I know you said that while you had a big improvement, you’re still not where you want to be. Can you talk about where you were for nursing turnover pre pandemic, where you ended Q4, and maybe where you think you could end 2023? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Excuse me. So Ann, it’s Sam. We, pre pandemic, were somewhere around 13% or 14% – excuse me, 14% for nursing turnover. We’re on a run rate now 18%, 18.5%. That’s down from mid-20s. We think the industry average is somewhere in the mid to upper 20s right now from what we’ve seen external benchmarks and so forth. So we’re really encouraged by the progress our teams have made. And again, over the last 6 months of the year, we were starting to see improving trends. We believe we have the right initiatives in place to carry some momentum in that area into 2023. The market, as I mentioned, is a bit tenuous still, but we’re encouraged by the investments we’ve made in our recruiting, the investments we’ve made in retention and leadership training and just the – I’ll call it, the hand-to-hand combat that exists in making sure that our employees have the resources on their units that are necessary for them to deliver great care to their patients and for them to be successful in whatever their role is in the company. And we think we’re making progress on pretty much all of those fronts.
Bill Rutherford: And Ann, on the emergency room, I’ve brought it to more than emergency from just hospital-based physician we have talked about in the past. We are seeing some increased pressures for subsidies around our interest room and anesthesiologists and the like. We have a number of initiatives to try to counter those. But yes, we are expecting some upward pressure in those areas that we factored into our guidance. If it rolls through, as I mentioned in the previous question, in our other operating expenses, then we could potentially see higher single-digit year-over-year growth in those categories, probably at a little bit of pace above our revenue. But we think we’ve made appropriate consideration for those trends inside of our guidance.
Ann Hynes: Alright. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. I guess, Sam, follow-up to Ann’s question and to Bill’s answer of that. I saw that you exercise the call option and the Envision JV last week. So just curious how you’re thinking about operationalizing that and what would change for HCA as you bring those physicians back in-house? And maybe just thoughts on the P&L and balance sheet impact of that as well? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: So we’ve had a wonderful relationship with Envision over the years, and it continues to be strong across different facilities in our company. A number of years ago, we had made an investment in a co-venture with them that we felt was an opportunity for us to integrate that physician service, mainly in the ER and hospitalist medicine and a few other subspecialty categories within our hospitals as more clinically aligned and so forth. And what we see is an opportunity to further that. And so we are moving to acquire a larger percentage of that co-venture, and we think it will give us a little better visibility in how to achieve better clinical integration to improve quality. We think we can use that platform to improve efficiency within our emergency rooms primarily and even on our med surge floors where our hospitalists work. It will support graduate medical education in some innovative ways, we believe. And then, finally, we think it offers up an opportunity for us to advance our connections to our strategic outreach partners in ways that maybe we don’t necessarily accomplish in the structure we have today. So we are pushing through the final stages of that transaction. I think it’s scheduled to close sometime in the spring. We will take the rest of the year to fully assimilate it, so to speak. And then as we get into 2024, we anticipate being able to execute more effectively on these categories.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.
Stephen Baxter: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask a follow-up on the 2023 guidance, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more specifically about your expectations on inpatient admissions. I guess, first, how are you thinking about where the COVID figure goes in 2023 compared to the 5.2% of admissions in 2022? Any implication being I’d love to hear how you’re thinking about non-COVID admission growth in 2023? Thank you.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. So I’ll start with that. So we expect a continued decline of COVID admission as you’ve mentioned, and I said in my prepared remarks, they represent about 5.2% of our total admissions. This year, we’re thinking next year, probably somewhere between 3% and 4% of our total admissions. We believe right now, our inpatient admission growth somewhere around that 2% number, and that’s embedded within the equivalent admission guidance that I gave between 2% to 3%. And again, we will continue to monitor that as we go through the year. We continue to believe that there is strong demand in our markets, and we’re positioned well to serve that demand. So inpatient volume, we’re thinking hovering around 2%, and then outpatient revenue probably continue to grow in that mid-single-digit level. And that helps us get to the 2% to 3% equivalent admissions that’s – that our guidance entails.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Interested if you can just recap for us what the non-COVID acuity and case mix trends were in 2022. And then what you’re building in for your assumptions for 2023? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. So I don’t know if I have the case mix necessarily. We’ve seen relatively flat, as I recall, on the COVID case mix, right? Our non-COVID mix improved about 2% sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter going forward. Our revenue per equivalent admission was roughly flat for the year-over-year comparisons.
Scott Fidel: And then, Bill, on the outlook for ‘23.
Bill Rutherford: For non-COVID?
Scott Fidel: Yes.
Bill Rutherford: Yes, that would be embedded in our revenue per equivalent admission of about 2%. And then when you factor out the loss of the revenue items, I think, as I mentioned earlier, that pushes us closer to 3%. And that would be just a combination of all factors of acuity as well as payer mix and pricing trends underneath the...
Sam Hazen: And Bill if I can add, I think it’s important for everybody to understand it. Strategically, we continue to invest in programs, as I mentioned in my prepared comments. A lot of those programs are farther up the acuity ladder, if you will. They are more significant programs. They are extensions of existing programs and as we get our footing, so to speak, with a mid-level program or an upper-mid level program, then we can move into a more acute level program. And that helps with our overall acuity statistic. So, that part of our strategy, we are doing that on top of the same fixed cost platform. So, our hospitals have the same fixed cost regardless of the acuity in many instances. And so if we can increase the acuity, we get operating leverage from that. So, strategically, that’s a very important initiative of ours. The transfers and that we haven’t been able to take care of tends to be slightly more acute than our average in most instances. And here, again, that’s why it’s so important for us to get more employees across the organization to take care of these patients who need our services. But all of that’s embedded inside of a real strategic initiative that we have.
Operator: Our next question comes from Calvin Sternick with JPMorgan.
Calvin Sternick: Hi. Good morning. It looks like another strong quarter for ER volumes. Can you talk a bit about the trends you have seen there in the last few quarters in terms of payer acuity mix, and what you are expecting for sort of full year? And as you think about the volume trends across the business over the last couple of quarters, are there any service lines or categories that have over or underperformed relative to your expectations? And any color you can give on those going into 2023? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. Let me speak to some of our service lines trends. During the pandemic, we felt the emergency room might be disrupted from what our previous beliefs were. And there was new uses of telemedicine alternatives that were being experienced, we thought. What we have seen is just the opposite. The resiliency of the emergency room for communities is even greater than we thought. And the demand there is very strong because our emergency rooms and other people’s emergency rooms are a solution set for people whenever healthcare is needed. So, our trends in the emergency room have been very solid over the course of the year. And when you look at them really without the COVID activity, it’s especially impressive I think. We have seen good volume growth in our orthopedics. Our total joint business for the quarter was up 6%. In many instances, we fully absorbed, we believe, most of the shift over the last 3 years during the pandemic, with the orthopedic business moving from inpatient to outpatient. And in most instances, we believe the large majority of that is behind us. And so we don’t have that as a pressure point like we have had over the past 3 years. But nonetheless, we have grown that business in the face of the site of care shift. We have a very robust pipeline for our emergency rooms, especially our freestanding emergency room platform, a very significant development opportunity there for us across our communities, and we are investing in that. Our urgent care center platform continues to grow. We are up to 260 urgent care centers. We will probably push through 300 in 2023. Our ambulatory surgery center platform continues to grow. Here, again, we have more de novo development inside of our ambulatory surgery center platform than we have had in the past, and we are encouraged by how that fits into our networks in a very productive way. So, we are really pretty excited about our investments in our ambulatory network, our investments in our acuity programs and our higher service lines. And we will continue to – we believe, be well positioned to deal with the growing demand that we see in the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.
Lance Wilkes: Yes. Could you just talk a little bit about permanent nurses and understand the retention rates are getting better there. Can you talk a little bit about new hirings, what sort of growth you are seeing there? What are maybe some of the drivers of access to nurses there, where are they coming from? And then also, if you could just talk a little bit about, you said the investment spend was pressuring and the long-term plan was pressuring ‘22 a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about how ‘23 might look compared to ‘22 with that? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Why don’t you take, Bill, the last question?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. This is Bill. On the investments, when you think about the technology investments, the investments we are making in some of the clinical transformation. And I would also say, with the expansion of our nursing schools going forward, probably is somewhere around an incremental investment of $150 million in ‘23 compared to what we ran in ‘22. Lance, we didn’t call that out, but it’s part of a long-term investment we think, that will continue to drive performance and value for us.
Sam Hazen: So, our hiring in 2022 was up a little north of 6%, just a huge number of new hires. And so that’s the total number just as a starting point. Where that is coming from, that’s coming from new grads. There still is a decent pipeline of new graduate nurses in our communities. We have academic partnerships with different colleges beyond Galen that are important to that pipeline. We are also seeing some travelers decide that, okay, enough, we traveled, we want to come back, and we have been able to recover some of the employees who traveled for a period of time back into our organization. So, we continue to be focused on trying to recover them. And I think again, with our benefits and with our wage adjustments and all the investments we are making in clinical education and other components of our labor agenda, we are starting to see more favorable trends in our recruitment function that we think, if they carry into 2023 and through the year, should be positive for us.
Lance Wilkes: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Cassorla with Citigroup.
Jason Cassorla: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a bit more on your capital priorities. You have recently divested ownership in some hospitals. But just wondering how you are viewing the M&A backdrop and if you are seeing opportunities to increase your footprint in your current markets or potentially entering into new markets? And then just on share repurchases, you have increased your authorization by $3 billion, you have $4.5 billion rough remaining. It’s just in light of the $7 billion this year. Just curious how you are thinking about share repurchases in the context of your larger capital deployment priorities? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes, let me take that. This is Bill. Let me take the latter one first. I think share repurchases, you spend an important part of our overall balanced capital allocation. As you mentioned, we did $7 billion in ‘22. We will have authorization close to $4.5 billion. I think we would plan on completing the majority of it sometime in this calendar year with a little bit of roll forward afterwards. And again, we will continue to adjust as kind of market conditions present, but a share repurchase program has just been part of our overall balanced allocation of capital going forward.
Sam Hazen: For M&A, we have been fairly active in the market with outpatient acquisitions again when they come available, whether it’s urgent care, some freestanding emergency room, some ASC, some physician clinics and so forth. And those are very complementary, synergistic to our network acquisitions, and we will continue to pursue those as they develop. We have not had too many opportunities on hospital acquisitions. Although, recently there was an announced LOI on a hospital just outside of the Dallas-Fort Worth market that we think is synergistic with respect to clinical services and so forth with our system in Dallas-Fort Worth. So, we will continue to look for those. We do have a pipeline of Greenfield hospitals because the acquisition environment is not as robust end market as maybe we would have hoped. So, we need to consider Greenfield projects, and we do have a number of those that are in the works. We have one under construction currently in San Antonio. And I want to say we have seven or eight parcels of land, maybe 10, that are designed for future hospital development when the time is right for us to make those investments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning everybody. So, just on the surgical volumes, you addressed most of the key questions related to the volumes for both the fourth quarter and the full year ‘23. But just a follow-up on that topic to get, I guess a little bit more. I was just curious whether or not you do see any notable pent-up demand for any surgical cases exiting out of 4Q ‘22 that might be falling at least into the early part of ‘23 for various reasons, just curious any visibility on early ‘23 at this stage? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: It’s hard for us to really judge the – whether there is demand on the sidelines, and we don’t see it. I mean we get some anecdotal information from our physicians who might indicate that, okay, their clinic patient profiles were better in the fourth quarter than they were at any point in time in 2022. I don’t know if that’s a precursor or not for pent-up elective surgical demand. I think we are just going to have to wait and see. But I believe it’s a positive metric and a positive anecdote that their clinic roles, patient roles appear to be at a higher level than they were in previous parts of 2022.
Steven Valiquette: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.
Jamie Perse: Thank you. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the commercial reimbursement dynamics, first, can you remind us what percent of contracts have been recently negotiated that will take us back at the higher rate January 1st? And then secondly, can you give us a little bit of color on what the initial bump in those contracts looks like relative to the rate escalators that are locked in place for the next couple of years? Thank you.
Sam Hazen: We have, I want to say, Bill, maybe 70% of our contracts for 2024 contracted. I will tell you that most of the contracts, if not all of the contracts we closed in the last three quarters of ‘22 were in line with our expectations, which was around mid-single digit inflators. So, those have to work their way into the ‘23 portfolio of contracts and on into the 2024. So, we are encouraged by the outcomes of those negotiations. I think there is a general recognition in the payer community that the input costs for providers is up, or up. And so given those inflationary pressures, they recognize that there is a sensitivity to respond to that. And we are trying to be appropriate in our app. And I think that’s been received well, and we have been able to close these contracts reasonably timely. So, we still have 30% or so of 2023 that will get negotiated over the first part of this year, and will carry us through all of ‘23 and into ‘24. We are about 40% contracted on ‘24. Again, the tail effect of some of the closed contract negotiations that we have just achieved will carry into 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research.
Joshua Raskin: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I know CapEx guidance for 2023 is only down slightly, and I know it’s still January, but it would be the first time in a long, long time, the CapEx would be down year-over-year, not counting 2020. I was wondering if you could just speak to any changes in budgeting or strategy or if there is anything that could be tempering that investment?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Josh, I don’t think there is anything tempering in the investment at all. I think 4.3% is our expectation. As I mentioned in my comments, we initially expected 4.2%. For ‘22, it came in a little higher because we had some year-end activity that I mentioned around some real estate and some IT. So, I wouldn’t read anything from down to the fourth quarter 4.3%. It’s actually up compared to where our initial expectations are. But as a summary, we still see very good opportunities to deploy capital, we believe, to capture growth opportunities in the marketplace. And we have talked about some of that, whether that would be through our freestanding EDs, whether there is some development of new hospitals, whether it would be expansion of campuses. So, again, I think it’s an important part of our overall capital allocation and I think an important part of our continued long-term focus on growing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Mok with UBS.
Andrew Mok: Hi. Good morning. I was hoping you could provide a bit more color on the supply cost trends into 2023. What are the assumptions around unit cost increases versus – what steps did you take to manage inflationary pressure for multiyear contracts? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Well, thank you for the question. Our teams and our supply chain teams have done an incredible job over the past 12 months to 18 months on our supply cost portfolio, and especially with the backdrop of inflationary increases. And we have talked about through the year, we have been really seeing really positive trends in and actually to keep our supply cost growth below our revenue growth. Much of that was because some of our contracts, 60% of our contracts or so was under firm pricing for the most of ‘22. As we look forward, I think our basic assumption is to continue to keep our supply cost as a percent of revenue flat from where we ran full year ‘23. That would imply our supply cost per unit is somewhere around that 2% level, plus or minus a little bit. But again, we are expecting continued good results in that. And again, our team is doing a nice job. We can keep that supply cost as a percent of revenue flat with where we ran this year, with the backdrop of inflationary that’s pretty positive. We have a number of initiatives underway that our teams use. Part of our benchmarking initiatives is to look at utilization and identify best practices across the organization. We also are looking at product selection, partnering with our clinical teams. So, we have a number of initiatives underneath our supply chain operations that are helping us to achieve those results, and we look forward to those continuing as we go into ‘23.
Operator: Our final question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James.
John Ransom: Yes. Hard it is to be clever with the question after all these good questions. I believe three in my question here and have five minutes. So, for me, if we think about, as you reduce your labor turnover, so let’s say it goes hypothetically from 25 to 20, how does that – how would that affect your labor cost per – either for revenue or per unit? How does that factor into the savings algorithm for us to think about?
Bill Rutherford: How it affects our revenue per unit?
John Ransom: Well. No. I mean salary either salary as a percent of adjusted admits or salary as a percent of revenue, how does reducing turnover? If you reduce turnover about say, 500 bps, how would that affect the labor margin?
Bill Rutherford: Well, in theory, will flow through as reduction of our contract labor. And so the margin, if you will, on the contract labor as we replace an individual from a contractor to an employed one is that we will save that margin. And being able to reinvest and what we have been able to do this year is reinvest back into our employee workforce and that’s part of that turnover level. And I think all of that, John, I would say, is incorporated, if you look at the overall labor spend. So, I mean there is a lot of components into that. And as we said, we think we can maintain our labor cost as a percent of revenue where we are finished this year. It’s a function of reducing those premium labor and reinvesting back into our employee workforce and keeping that relatively flat year-over-year. And I think that’s a good result for us and allows us to continue to recognize the important work our employees do for us.
John Ransom: Thanks a lot.
Bill Rutherford: Thanks John.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over back to Mr. Frank Morgan.
Frank Morgan: Devin, thank you for your help today and thanks to everyone for joining us on this call. We hope you have a great weekend. I am around this afternoon, if I can answer additional questions you might have. Have a great day.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-21 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.
Frank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today’s call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today’s call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today’s press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning’s call, we may refer to measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Inc. is included in today’s release. This morning’s call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning. Thanks for joining the call. As I’ve mentioned on past calls, it has been difficult over the pandemic period to judge our business trends because of the ups and downs we have experienced with the various COVID-19 surges. If you recall, the third quarter of 2021 was the most intense surge we saw with the Delta variant, and it significantly influenced our business, making it difficult to compare. We believe the second quarter and the third quarter of this year provide us with the most sustained period yet for us to judge our business. Generally, the financial results in the third quarter were in line with our internal expectations. As compared to the second quarter, our revenue production was consistent with overall volumes, payer mix and acuity generally stable. These results were generated with capacity constraints in certain situations caused by ongoing labor market challenges. In the quarter, we continued to invest significantly in our workforce including the opening of one more Galen College of Nursing campus. These investments produced improvement in retention, more new hires and reduced contract labor expenses. Overall, operating margins were solid and were a positive reflection on the disciplined execution by our teams. I want to thank them for their enduring commitment to our patients and our facilities. We continue to be impressed by the resolve and dedication. These attributes were once again put to the test with Hurricane Ian. Fortunately, no patient or employee was harmed during the storm. And with the help of our partners, all facilities with the exception of one are fully operational. In the face of disasters, whether a pandemic or a hurricane, the people of HCA Healthcare continue to shine. Normally, on this call, we attempt to provide you with some early perspectives on the upcoming year. Currently, we have reasonable insights into certain aspects of our business such as demand, which we believe will grow around 1% to 2% next year. We also expect payer mix and acuity to remain stable. However, with respect to inflation, we are less certain. We have responded to these unprecedented inflationary and macroeconomic pressures, and we will continue to respond with our workforce initiatives and our financial resiliency program, but it is too early to judge the effectiveness of our response as these forces and the related governmental responses continue to evolve and impact various categories of our costs. Therefore, we will refrain from providing the typical early outlook for 2023 until we finish our planning process in early January. By then, we will have seen another three months of performance to assess the overall environment as well as our response to it. I will close with this. We continue our work to position the Company for long-term success and sustained stakeholder and shareholder value. Our strategic plan is designed to optimize the networks we have built over the years by resourcing them with better technology and analytics, new and innovative care models and a highly trained workforce. We believe these efforts position us well to grow and effectively leverage our deployed capital. But more importantly, they position us better to deliver on our mission and provide higher quality care to our patients in a more efficient manner. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill. Thank you.
Bill Rutherford: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some additional comments on the quarter. As Sam mentioned, our results in the third quarter were in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.902 billion, adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.4%, and diluted earnings per share was $3.93, excluding losses on sale of facilities of $0.02. Our same facility volume levels in the third quarter were generally consistent with our second quarter levels. Our volume trends compared to the prior year reflect the COVID-19 surge we experienced in the prior year. For example, our same facility admissions are down 1.5% when compared to the prior year. COVID admissions were down almost 60% this quarter compared to third quarter of last year, and they represented almost 13% of admissions in Q3 of last year versus 5% of admissions in third quarter of this year. Non-COVID admissions increased 6.9% in the quarter as compared to the prior year and are up 2.7% year-to-date. Acuity and payer mix levels were generally consistent with second quarter levels as well and led to comparable revenue per equivalent admission between the second and third quarter. As mentioned in our release, we recorded approximately $266 million of revenue and $125 million of expenses related to the Florida directed payment program during the quarter. Approval for this program was received in September from CMS for the annual period ending September 30, 2022. In addition, we estimate the impact of Hurricane Ian, which made landfall on the West Coast of Florida on September 28th, was approximately $35 million in the quarter. Our labor costs were generally in line with our expectations. We made market-based wage adjustments for our employee workforce and were able to absorb much of this with a 19% reduction in contract labor as compared to the second quarter. Supply cost trends remained stable, both sequentially and when compared to the prior year. Other operating expenses increased sequentially from the second quarter but this is mostly due to the Florida DPP expenses and some increases in professional fees and utility costs. We remain focused on our resiliency programs that we’ve spoken to in past calls. And overall, our teams are doing a great job responding to the inflationary market dynamics while also identifying efficiency opportunities. Let me transition to discuss some cash flow and balance sheet metrics, which continue to be a strength for HCA Healthcare. Our cash flow from operations was $3.02 billion in the quarter, and capital spending was $1.13 billion. We completed approximately $700 million of share repurchase during the quarter and just under $5.5 billion year-to-date. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was just above the low end of our stated leverage range, and we had approximately $3.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Lastly, I will mention that our full year 2022 guidance remains unchanged. So, with that, let me turn the call back over to Sam for some quick comments before we go to Q&A.
Sam Hazen: Yes. One thing I wanted to share are the themes that we believe are takeaways from our quarter and sort of the normal business trends that we were judging between the second and third quarter. And these themes are as follows: first, again, we think our top line metrics are stable and normal seasonality patterns are beginning to show themselves; number two, we are making progress on our human resource agenda, our engagement levels are up, and so we’re encouraged by that; number three, inflation is real. It’s a pressure point, but we’re working our way through it with our resiliency agenda and other initiatives; and then fourth is that long-term growth prospects, we believe exist across our portfolio. So those things, we think, are important to our judgment of the third quarter as compared to the second quarter and as we look to push forward on into next year and the years thereafter. So with that, Frank, I’ll turn it over to you for questions.
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Sam. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so that we may give as many as possible in the queue an opportunity to ask a question. Dennis, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question today comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. One maybe a technical point. Are you just -- commenting on Hurricane Ian and the impact in the early part of the fourth quarter. And then broader question is around your surgery volumes. You clearly showed good trends inpatient versus a year ago outpatient consistent with what you’ve shown year-to-date. I’m assuming that some of that relates to what was happening last year with the Delta surge. But, can you give us some flavor for where you’re at inpatient-outpatient, and are we sort of back to a normal environment there? It sounds like you think you might see a step-up in the fourth quarter just from a normal seasonal pattern, but any comments there?
Sam Hazen: Well, A.J., this is Sam. I’ll let Bill comment on the first question around Hurricane Ian in the fourth quarter. I mean, we had two facilities -- let me back up on Hurricane Ian, just to give everybody some perspective. We did evacuate, I think it was four hospitals in the Tampa, St. Pete area when we believed the storm was going to hit further north. When the storm ultimately moved south on as we were able to move out our most critically ill patients out of two hospitals, and those two hospitals were hit pretty hard in Charlotte County. One of those hospitals suffered a pretty significant damage and we were able to get aspects of it opened already. Our emergency room is back open, one of our med-surg floors is back open, and we think will be fully operational by the end of the year. Our teams in West Florida division and really North Florida did an incredible job at responding to a really impactful hurricane. So that influenced our results in the third quarter. Our volumes were down obviously in the West Florida division, in the North Florida division, which overseas Orlando. So, we had a lot of preparation in management in advance of the storm. So, it had a modest impact on our volumes. With respect to seasonality, we do believe that normal seasonal patterns are starting to exist. And that typically yields more activity in the fourth quarter on outpatient surgery than the third quarter. So, we’re anticipating that, yes. And we are seeing normal patterns, we think, on other aspects of our business with respect to surgeries, cardiac procedures and so forth. And so, that gives us some ability to judge where we are and what initiatives are working. I think it’s important, A.J., to understand that our capacity constraints in the third quarter were real. And some of that was the typical challenges we’ve had over the last 2.5 years in managing capacity. But, we believe that we can continue to open more capacity as we move through the last part of this year and on into next year. But in the quarter, we declined in many instances because we weren’t able to accommodate the patients, approximately 1% to 1.5% of our total admissions simply because of capacity constraints. So, we need to resolve those. Again, the progress that we’re making on our HR agenda we believe is going to help us maintain sufficient capacity to take care of the patients who need our services. So, we’ll continue to push on those agendas and we’re encouraged, though, by the progress that we’re making.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Pito Chickering: I understand that you don’t want to give sort of 2023 guidance at this point, but can you help us sort of quantify a couple of things? How should we think about top line growth next year? You talked about sort of 1% or 2% demand. Where do you expect the pricing to be, any color on managed care price increases in 2023 versus 2022? Now, on the cost side of the equation, what are you seeing for full-time inflation in the fourth quarter this year? I think that evolves next year. Any color on sort of how new grads coming out of nursing schools, decreases contract labor? And then any sort of thoughts around non-labor inflation next year that you can give some color on? Thanks so much.
Bill Rutherford: Well, Pito, this is Bill. Let me try. I mean, I think Sam gave you comments on our thinking about top line. And really, the uncertainty remains around inflationary trends. And that’s what we’re looking at. Take the balance of the year, coupled with our experience so far to get some informed judgment as we go into 2023. So, it’s a bit too early to provide too many details. We’re pleased with the continuation of labor agenda. We’re pleased with the continuation of reductions of contract labor. And we’re just going to have to judge the overall inflationary environment as we go into 2023. We think our teams and our resiliency efforts are good countermeasures to that. But that’s what we’re taking a little bit more time to kind of be able to judge that, and we’ll give you a full commentary in January.
Sam Hazen: I think just to add a point to the third quarter as compared to the second quarter, our salary, wages and benefit cost per hour were flat with the second quarter. That was partially due to a 20% reduction in contract expenses. And at the same time, our normal wage timing for adjustments for our employees happens in the third quarter. And so, we were able to absorb that with the management of our contract labor expenses. So, that was encouraging. That’s the first quarter in a while where we’ve seen stabilization in our labor cost per hour when you mix all components of our labor costs. So, we’ll continue to hopefully make some strides in that area and moderate some of the pressures, Pito, that exist in the labor market as we continue to execute on our recruitment agenda, our retention agenda, our capacity management and so forth.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Ann Hynes: Your volume guidance for next year is 1% to 2%. And I believe that’s a little lower than historically, you typically guide 2% to 3%. Can you just talk about that and maybe what procedures aren’t coming back or why you feel like it’s not going to be a normal year since COVID admissions, while they still exist, aren’t at the height they used to be?
Sam Hazen: I think for -- this is Sam, Ann. I think the 1% to 2% is a little bit lower than maybe historical trends because we will have some COVID admission activity in ‘22 that we don’t think will be as much in ‘23. So, if you normalize for COVID, it’s sort of in the zone of what our historical trends have been. We think outpatient activity would be a little stronger than inpatient activity as it has been historically. But we do see, with the strong markets that we have and with the investments that we’re making in our network that we should be able to achieve those normal trends when you normalize for some of the COVID activity, which we don’t anticipate at the same level next year. So that’s part of the explanation. There’s still a little bit of the influence there from COVID.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on 2022. So first, in the -- your update -- you didn’t update guidance. I assume that means that it remained intact. Just curious, given we’re three quarters through, where you think within that guidance range you might end up? And then in the third quarter, to your point, COVID admissions were fluctuated pretty good. I was hoping you might be able to give us a revenue per admission number ex-COVID, just so we can see what the growth is doing ex that big swing in COVID. Thanks a lot.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Justin, this is Bill. Let me -- on guidance first. Yes, we’re maintaining our previous guidance, which does accommodate a wider range of outcomes than we might typically have at this point in the year. But given the uncertainties in the environment that we’ve talked about, we think it’s appropriate at this time, and we’ll just continue to manage our way through the balance of the year. Relative to non-COVID revenue for adjusted admission, we saw growth in both, overall as well as managed care. If you bear with me for a minute, I’ll get you the exact number. So yes, we were up about 2 points on revenue per adjusted admission on the non-COVID for the quarter.
Justin Lake: And Bill, that would strip out the Florida revenues as well?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, it would be.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Gary Taylor with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Two quick ones. The first is, when we think about some of the headwinds for ‘23 that you talked about before, the Texas out of period, some of the COVID reimbursement, et cetera. Does the Florida DPP, does that constitute a headwind for ‘23, or is that a program if it’s you’d expect to continue such that the annual number is the same? And then, my second question is -- I hear your comments on inflation. And obviously, we look at the pretty good labor performance this quarter and supply cost per adjusted patient actually down year-over-year. So, are you signaling that there’s a new inflection point in inflation that you’re concerned about for ‘23? And is that in the labor, or is that in other operating, so it’s utilities and insurance and that sort of thing?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Hey Gary, this is Bill. Let me address the Florida DPP. We are not anticipating that to be a headwind next year. That is an annual program, have received annual approval. So, we are subject to approval. But, as you might recall, we reported some amounts in the fourth quarter of last year. And with this amount, we would, at this point, anticipate that program will continue, and it’s material for next year, but we’ll continue to evaluate that.
Sam Hazen: Yes. And Gary, this is Sam. On inflation, we’re not really signaling anything. We’re just suggesting that we want to go three more months and understand the progress that we hope to make with our labor agenda and some of our other efforts. And that will give us, hopefully, 9, 10 months’ worth of normal run of business. Again, we haven’t had that for three years. And that will help inform where we think the market is, where we think our initiatives are and how that’s positioning us for ‘23, and we’ll give you more specificity at that particular point in time on the different cost categories and inflationary pressures that exist within each of those.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Mok with UBS. Please go ahead.
Andrew Mok: I understand you’re not commenting on 2023 at this point, but can you help us understand the level of nonrecurring benefits in 2022, so we can bridge to a proper 2022 baseline? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Well, I mean, we’ve talked publicly before around the Texas out-of-period amounts that we recorded earlier in the year that related to last year. That was approximately $150 million. And then, we’ve sized the various COVID support payments we received this year that we don’t anticipate to continue around $300 million. And so, those would be the two areas we’ve talked about before. And there is other pluses and minuses, 340B is out there. But those are the two things that I would highlight at this point.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Whit Mayo with SVB Securities. Please go ahead.
Whit Mayo: Thanks. I just want to go back to contract labor for a minute. I appreciate the disclosure that it declined 19%. Can you maybe frame that as a percentage of SWB in the third quarter and also maybe what the exit rate is? And also, Bill, your comment on market-based wage adjustments, is there any way to maybe quantify that on an FTE basis or a per hour basis, just to put into perspective the level of inflation that you’re seeing and how different that is maybe from the beginning of the year? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Whit, on the contract labor percent of SWB was about 7.2% for the quarter, and that’s pretty much close to our exit rate, as you say, for the quarter. So that’s a good improvement. Roughly speaking, half of that was through the continued reduction of the average hourly rate and half though reduction of utilization of contract labor. So, we’re very pleased with those trends going forward.
Sam Hazen: Yes. Typically -- Whit, this is Sam. We give our wage increases in the third quarter. It varies a little bit market to market. But that’s when the lion’s share of our increases go through. And we’ve been a little bit active throughout the last year or so with targeted market adjustments here and there throughout the year, but we felt we needed to be a little bit more significant. So, we -- the composite is a little north of 4%. If you look at third quarter to second quarter, as far as average hourly rate increases for our employed forces. Again, that’s just the third quarter to second quarter, and we were able to absorb that inside of our contract labor expense management and yielded again labor cost as a composite flat with the third quarter compared to the second quarter. We still are running with a lot more nurses in contract labor than we did in 2019. So, we have room to go, we believe. We obviously have to execute on our human resource agenda to make that happen. And we’ve invested heavily in our recruitment capabilities, and they’ve done a wonderful job of improving our recruitment processing and really creating a better applicant experience as well as a better management experience for our management teams out there. We have very intentional retention efforts, including compensation and benefits and flexible scheduling and so forth in order to improve retention, and we’re seeing progress there. Our engagement results just came in, very positive. So we’re really encouraged by our abilities to capitalize on modifying our workforce over time. That can change. We understand that, but at this particular juncture, that’s where we are.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ben Hendrix: One of your -- your competitor noted an increase in clinicians out on quarantine this quarter, and clearly, they had an impact on agency labor, and you seem to have managed obviously agency labor much better. And I’m wondering what you saw in terms of staff quarantine rates and -- this quarter versus prior? And how were you able to manage that? And if you saw any scheduling delays on the outpatient electives as a result of changing quarantine rates? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. Thank you for that question. We -- I don’t know of any quarantine issues that we experienced in the third quarter this year. Obviously, last year with the Delta variant, we had a number of our staff who were out on quarantine. But this year, that has not surfaced as an issue for us across our divisions. I mean, I’m sure there were some people who experienced some COVID in our workforce, but it wasn’t a significant piece of issue for us.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Lance Wilkes: Yes. So, could you talk a little bit about rate negotiations with managed care? What progress you’re seeing on that? And maybe if you can give some context on the market environment, if you’re seeing any smaller hospitals that are terming contracts or if you, in fact, termed any contracts? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Well, we’ve mentioned in the past that we felt the inflationary pressures that we’re incurring on our cost structure are being received reasonably well by the payer community. And that has, in fact, happened. We closed some additional contracts in the third quarter of this year, and they were generally in the target of where we had indicated previously that we expected our new contracts to land, and that was somewhere in the mid-single-digits. So, we are making progress with respect to our renegotiations. As I mentioned, we were already partially negotiated for 2023, and we continue to add to that negotiation in contract completion rate as we move through the third quarter. So, we’re encouraged by the renegotiations that have occurred, and we are about 70% contracted for 2023 and about 45% contracted for 2024, and we’re seeing elevated escalators by comparison to our historical trends on our commercial contract book. As it relates to our competitors, there’s always pockets of negotiations where there’s terminations and so forth. We have not had to terminate any contracts in any significant fashion. We’ve been able to reach agreements that work for us and work for the payers, and we’ll continue to hopefully be able to make that happen. We are working with the payers with respect to making sure that our accounts receivables are handled timely and appropriately with respect to denials and so forth, and we are incorporating that into our discussions in a way that we think will be productive for us and hopefully productive for the payers.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brian Tanquilut: Sam, I appreciate you guys providing some insight into next year’s volume expectations. But, as we stare down a recession here, I mean, how are you thinking about the resilience of the business? You guys did fairly well during the last recession, but just some thoughts on that and maybe your thoughts on any differences this time around versus ‘07 to 2012?
Sam Hazen: Well, I think the most material difference, and I mentioned this on the last earnings call we had is that the Affordable Care Act and the exchange community provides a potential safety net that heretofore in previous recessionary cycles we didn’t have. And that, for us, we believe, is a positive. As it relates to the other aspects of our business, our demand for healthcare services tends to lag the rest of the economy and we tend to see demand in the earlier part of a recessionary cycle sort of hold, and that was when people were under COBRA benefits and so forth and then it would fade over time. But with the Affordable Care Act and the support that the exchanges provide, we’re not sure how to gauge that at this particular juncture, because it’s a new dynamic, but we believe it to be a favorable dynamic. So, that would be where we are at this particular point with judging the future impact of a recessionary cycle. I think, our teams are working to with our resiliency agenda and other efforts to anticipate where they can anticipate and make adjustments where they can to put us in the best position to be successful. We think our balance sheet is strong and that should create opportunities for us to invest in certain situations and hopefully gain market share. You look at our markets as a whole, Florida, Texas, Nashville, Vegas. These are fairly strong durable economies, we believe. It may be a little stronger than the nation as a whole. So, that can hopefully add some support as we go into a recessionary cycle potentially in the future.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Fischbeck: I guess, there’s somewhat of a question about how we should be thinking about volume normalization. You guys are above 2019, but you’re probably 4% to 7% below where you would have thought if you were to grow 2% to 3% every year up to 2019. And it looks like you’re still talking about that growth rate being below average again next year. I mean, how are you -- it sounds like you’re saying you think that demand in your markets is durable, but it still feels like you’re getting farther and farther away from that trend line in the near term. So, can you just help us frame how we should be thinking about that? Is it labor that is the gating factor to getting back there? Are there other things -- and how long if that trend line is the right way to think about it, I guess you can say that or not? But if it is the right way to think about it, how are you thinking about what has to happen to get us back to that trend line?
Sam Hazen: Let me make a couple of comments. I do think there is an imbalance between supply of healthcare and demand for healthcare right now, primarily because of some of the labor constraints. And people are being pushed out, they’re being held up. Again, transfers are not happening as we had anticipated. So, there is some influence to that. Anecdotally, we’ve heard from some of our physicians that their clinic practices are starting to recover in ways that maybe earlier in the year, they didn’t recover. So that’s encouraging to us at some level. Obviously, during the comparison of 2019 to today, our total joint business migrated fairly significantly to outpatient activity. When you look at 2019, on the outpatient side against the third quarter of 2022, we think our outpatient activity has grown 5% or 6% over that time period. Our inpatient activity is down a little bit, most of which is explained by the total joint movement. So, we were asking ourselves when you think about it, did that business go away or not. So, I think when you look at our non-COVID admission activity, which year-to-date has grown 3% and grown a little bit more even in the commercial business, it is actually sequentially growing third quarter to second quarter. That gives us encouragement that we’re moving closer to the historical trend. Again, we have a little bit of COVID influence this year because we had activity in the first quarter and a little bit of activity this quarter. But, when we look at non-COVID by itself, we’re encouraged by what we’re seeing. ER visits have rebounded and shown a great deal of resiliency. So, we think it’s migrating closer to the historical trend than not.
Kevin Fischbeck: Would you say then that the hip knee move-out is something that’s unusual, or I mean there’s always a shift to outpatient every...
Sam Hazen: Yes, there are always some elements of it. I think that more pronounced one that we’ve seen in a long time.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel: Question just around, obviously, another one of the sort of uncertain swing factors for 2023 is just around the public health emergency and whether that gets finally pulled back or not. Can you just remind us for HCA again, just what the key impacts or benefits that you’ve been seeing from the PHE would be? And how that would factor into your thinking for next year, would you ultimately see the public health emergency go away? Clearly, return of redeterminations in Medicaid is probably the biggest item, but just any others as well would be helpful. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Scott, this is Bill. I think the primary was coded add-on to the DRG payments that we’ve spoken about. Given the COVID volume has kind of moderated, that hasn’t been material for us. So, that’s the area there. As you said, then the next area and probably more significant is just if it does -- when it does expire, what the Medicaid redetermination process will occur by various states. We’ve evaluated that. We’ve got, I think, good planning exercise around this. So, those would be the I think consequences or effects of the PHE, not material on the DRG add-on at this point, and then we’ll prepare ourselves to go through Medicaid redeterminations.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jason Cassorla with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jason Cassorla: Great. Thanks, and good morning. Just related to fourth quarter, I guess, COVID has trended higher so far this year than perhaps your previous expectations. But, can you help on how you’re thinking about COVID activity for fourth quarter and if you’re thinking if it will accelerate versus this quarter? And then, also, just what your expectations are for flu trends, maybe just in guidance and for 4Q? And how we should think about what an elevated flu environment would mean for this year, maybe just in context of the current labor backdrop and versus historical flu seasons? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. I’ll start with COVID. We don’t have specific fourth quarter projections. As I said in my comments, we ran about 5% of our admissions in the third quarter. We ran about 3% in the second. So, my intuition says somewhere between those areas might be an area we see in the fourth quarter on there. In terms of flu volumes, again, we haven’t made any specific projections for flu, but clearly, we’re paying attention to the flu volumes that are out there in the anticipation that it might be a busy flu season. But I don’t think that necessarily changes the trajectory of our fourth quarter compared to what we previously thought.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
John Ransom: Hey. Good morning I’m just thinking about sequential labor trends from 3Q to 4Q. And I heard you say you gave the 5% -- 4% [ph] update in 3Q. Does 4Q look flattish if you account for maybe continued reduction in temp labor, or if you hit a plateau in that 7 percentage range that you talked about?
Bill Rutherford: Well, I think it’s something we’re going to have to see that -- the contract labor levels, we feel good about, not only the progress we’ve made this year, as you know, we hovered around 9% in the early part in terms of contract labor percent of SWB down to 7%. We think we can stay in that range for the balance of the year. And so, yes, I think we feel generally positive about the labor environment we’re in. Too early to call specifically about is it flat, is there some growth. But I think we think can hold the majority of the contract labor trends, some incremental improvement with utilization as we continue to see recruitment and retention improve. So again, I think we’ll just have to see how it turns out, but we’re feeling positive about the labor agenda at this point.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin: I was wondering, Bill, if you could give us an update on your returns that you’re seeing on your capital expenditures, maybe how you’re thinking about spend into 2023. And maybe related to capital, anything we should read into the lower share repurchases in the last quarter here?
Bill Rutherford: No. This is -- I don’t think there’s anything you should read into that. And in terms of capital returns, we continue to see good projects to deploy capital. We continue to believe our total capital spending this year will hover around $4.2 billion. We’re in the planning stages for next year, but I anticipate it stays materially in that range. And I think that is an indication of the opportunities we continue to see to put capital to work, to meet what will be a growing demand in both, inpatient capacity as well as outpatient and program development. And again, I think with the cash profile of HCA, we’ve got a pretty balanced allocation of capital. The balance sheet is in a great position. I think our share repurchase program this year will hover around $7 billion for the full year. So, again, I think it’s strong allocation of capital. We’re intending to drive reasonable returns going forward.
Joshua Raskin: And Bill, I think you’ve said in the past something around north of 15% total, total return on CapEx, including maintenance and growth. Is that still the right range? Are you guys still generating sort of mid-teens returns on those CapEx projects?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. I mean, obviously, each project varies. But when I step up and look at our overall return on invested capital, we’re in the high teens. So, that we’re encouraged by the net effect of all of our investment decisions.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jamie Perse: I wanted to see if you could talk about length of stay. It’s still quite elevated versus 2019. What are the key bottlenecks you’re facing, both on inpatient throughput as well as discharge? Do you think those will go away over the course of 2023? And what does that mean in terms of your capacity expansion and also managing costs on a per patient day or per admission basis?
Sam Hazen: I think one thing. This is Sam. That’s important to understand. Our length of stay is up over 2019. But our case mix is up even more. So, when you look at our length of stay on a case mix adjusted basis, it’s actually down. So, that’s encouraging. Now, we have opportunities. We have significant opportunities, we believe, with better case management protocols, better use of technology, better partnerships with subacute providers and our own providers in that space to really improve the throughput in our facility. Just this past week, actually, we had an update on our case management agenda, and we continue to be encouraged by the progress incrementally that they’re making. And we think as we move on into 2023, that will continue. That is a key part of our capacity management and labor management as well. So, it’s got a lot of efficiencies connected to it. But, we have significantly increased our case mix over 2019, and that’s influenced our length of stay somewhat as well. But, I believe our overall program, which is a key ingredient to our resiliency effort is, in fact, adding value and will continue to add value for our patients as well as for the efficiency and the throughput within our facilities.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Calvin Sternick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Calvin Sternick: Yes. Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I think you noted the impact that capacity had on volumes in the quarter. Just curious, I guess, one, if you think that’s going to be relatively consistent going into the fourth quarter? And then, it looks like same-store ER visits picked up a bit sequentially. Just curious, are you starting to see some more episodic care start to bounce back in that setting? And has there been any shift in the payer mix you’re seeing there? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Well, we will still have some capacity constraints in the fourth quarter. I’m hopeful that we will relieve some of it with our recruitment agenda and the fact that we’re adding more headcount and opening beds. I think also, as I just mentioned, our case management efforts will create capacity for us as well. So -- but I do anticipate us having some closures here and there with respect to being able to take new patients at certain times. It just unfortunately happened at this at this particular point. And it happened pre-pandemic, but on a much lower level than it is today. As it relates to the ER, we’ve been impressed by how resilient our emergency room services are. We continue to work on our operations and our throughput within our emergency rooms so we can take care of people as they deserve to be taken care of. We’ve added capacity with our overall platform of emergency room offerings inside of our hospitals as well as some of our freestanding facilities, and that’s been important to our outreach in that area. We believe fundamentally that the emergency room is a key ingredient to the healthcare system overall, and it provides a very important 24/7, 365 capability for our communities. And so, we’re still investing, as I mentioned, in our emergency rooms in very selective ways in order to make sure that we have the right supply available for what we believe to be growing demand.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.
Stephen Baxter: I wanted to ask about the mix of outpatient revenue in the quarter. It looks like that stepped down a bit more than you might have expected in a typical year. What should we think about as the key drivers of that? I guess, with some distance, does it look like Q2 might have benefited from some pent-up demand? And it doesn’t sound like it based on your comments, but any impact you’d flag from outpatient surgeries moving back to inpatient at least maybe compared to earlier in the year? Thank you.
Bill Rutherford: No, I don’t think there’s anything structurally. I think the outpatient of revenue last year was busy during the Delta COVID -- the Delta surge and inpatient capacity was being managed and constrained and potentially, we saw more activity in outpatient of second quarter last year. But in terms of sequential trends, we don’t see anything structurally different going on between Q3 and Q2 on outpatient trends.
Operator: And today’s final question comes from the line of Sarah James with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Has there been a lift to acuity mix in ‘22 from some of the low acuity falling off related to consumer reactions, either COVID or the economy? And what would that do to revenue per admission as it normalizes? And then, just a quick clarification. Earlier you mentioned the 24 payer contract has labor cost escalators, can you clarify if that’s a static or dynamic? Because I think some of the acuities we’re talking about dynamic escalators coming in to reflect labor cost fluctuations.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. I’ll answer the last question. Most of our inflators are static. We do have some contracts that have corridors, if you want to call that, or dynamic components to it with respect to inflation. So, most of our 24 will be more of a static inflator that we negotiate on the front end. And so, that’s how most of our contracts are structured.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. In terms of the case mix, I mean, we’re seeing some growth in our no-COVID case mix trends. We’ve been -- case mix has been stable for us. So, we haven’t noticed any remarkable decline in that. In the COVID business, obviously, COVID ran a higher case mix in our non-COVID, so that’s been a factor. But, when we look at basic trends or the acuity levels have been stable, but mostly between Q3 and Q2. So, we’re reading that as a fairly positive indicator.
Sarah James: Okay. So there’s not a falloff of low acuity non-COVID just from people either worried about the economy or COVID that’s kind of...
Bill Rutherford: No, we’re not seeing anything of that trend at this stage.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.
Frank Morgan: Dennis, thank you so much for your help today. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call. Hope you have a wonderful weekend. I’m around this afternoon, if I can answer any additional questions. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes the HCA Healthcare third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.
Frank Morgan: Good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then we'll take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam. Let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements they are based on management's current expectations, numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements, and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measure such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Samuel Hazen: Thank you, Frank, and good morning to everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. We are pleased with our financial results for the second quarter. The solid results were driven by good mix of volume with respect to payer mix and acuity, coupled with progress in managing our operating costs. Although overall demand for our services was not as strong as anticipated. When compared to the second quarter of last year, same facility revenue grew 4%. As indicated in our earnings release, same facility inpatient admissions declined 1.2% and adjusted admissions grew 0.5%. COVID admissions declined 18% and represented approximately 3% of total admissions, which is generally consistent with the mix in the prior year. COVID admissions dropped 70% from the first quarter. Emergency room visits on the same facilities basis grew 7.3% reflecting strong demand for the service. Volumes across most categories exceeded pre-pandemic levels, as compared to the second quarter of 2019. Many aspects of our business were positive considering the challenges we faced with the labor market and other inflationary pressures on costs. Our teams executed well as they have in the past through other difficult environments. Again, I want to thank them for their dedication and excellent work. Labor metrics improved in the quarter as compared to the first quarter. Recruitment was up, turnover was down and throughout the quarter we lowered contract labor expenses in each successive months with June down 22% as compared to April. Overall operating costs per adjusted admission improved on a sequential basis as compared to the first quarter. Because of these positive developments, we operated with more available capacity than we did in the first quarter and had solid volume growth sequentially. Additionally, we continue to expand our network offerings with new ambulatory centers and clinics. We opened three Galen nursing colleges in the quarter, and two more are scheduled to open later this year. And lastly, we increased hospital capacity with a targeted capital investments. If we look to the balance of the year, we see volumes returning to pre-pandemic seasonal trends, but we expect growth in inpatient admissions at a more modest level than previously indicated in our guidance and in line with gotten for outpatient categories. We believe our labor and resiliency plans are appropriately responsive to market dynamics and the needs of our business, and they should continue to generate improvements in our operations. So let me close with this, and as I've mentioned this in the past, HCA Healthcare has an outstanding track record of responding to our realities by adjusting our operations in an appropriate manner. That is a manner aligned with our mission to provide high quality care to our patients, while also being prudent with our financial management. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for more details on the quarter.
William Rutherford: Okay, great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some additional comments on the quarter. First, as Sam mentioned, we are pleased with the overall results of the quarter. Our diluted earnings per share was $4.21 in the quarter after excluding the $0.11 from the loss on sale of facilities and $0.20 from the retirement of debt. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.04 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.5%. Non-COVID. admissions were down 0.6% in the quarter, however, non-COVID managed care admissions were up $0.7% reflecting favorable payer mix. Non-COVID case mix was up slightly from the prior year, maintaining acuity gains we've made and overall our same facility impatient revenue per admission increased 3.3% from the second quarter of last year. In addition, as Sam mentioned, we saw improvement in most all key operating indicators compared to the first quarter, including our labor, supply, and other operating costs on both an adjusted admission and an adjusted patient day basis. We remain focused on our resiliency programs that have highlighted in last quarter’s call, including our staffing and capacity efforts, executing our next generation of shared services and identifying best practices across HCA healthcare through the advancement of our benchmarking and analytic processes. These efforts continue to be an important focus for us as we respond to the current operating environment and we are pleased with the progress in these areas. So let me transition to discuss some cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Our cash flow from operations was $1.63 billion in the quarter. Capital spending was $1.08 billion as compared to $842 million in the prior year period, and we completed just under $2.7 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was just above the low end of our stated leverage range. And we had just over $2.7 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Lastly, I will mention that our full-year 2022 guidance remains unchanged from what we highlighted last quarter. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank, and we'll open it up for Q&A.
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so that we might give as many as possible of a chance to ask a question. Chantel [ph], you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody, congratulations on managing very well through a tough environment. I just want to maybe near term and [Technical Difficulty]. It does seem to be some confusion out there about what's happening with volumes. And I know you guys mentioned inpatient, you're a little more cautious about the back half, it doesn't sound like much. But [Technical Difficulty] it's about the same. Are we sort of in your mind as a new normal? There's some speculation about how the incident of COVID positivity may be affecting people who was a doctor. Are you seeing any of that have come down effects on your business? I guess, do you sense that there's still a fair amount of deferral out there that needs to be worked with system? Any comments on that? And then more broadly on the coming out of all of this. I know the company said from time-to-time, because you don't see anything that changes your view that you can grow mid single digits EBITDA long-term with often being towards the high end of 4% to 6% target. And I wonder if that's still your thinking?
Samuel Hazen: A.J., thank you. This is Sam. I believe when it comes to healthcare demand, our overarching belief is that it's pretty durable, and in somewhat responsive to normal trends over time. Obviously, we're still trying to sort out the implications of COVID in the pandemic, on overall demand and make some judgments. Here again, it's only been really five months since the last surge, when you consider February, March and then through the second quarter. And so we're making some early judgments that we believe there will be normal seasonality trends with respect to how volumes behave over the balance of the year. As it relates to long-term intermediate term demand. Again, we're not seeing anything structural, that would suggest that overall demand is reduced or necessarily increase beyond what its normal trends were. And we think on the inpatient side, healthcare demand, at least in our markets is somewhere between 1% and 2% and a little bit more than that on the outpatient side. So that lines up with our pre-pandemic, but sort of thoughts around overall demand. So that's how we're seeing it. Again, we've seen incredible resiliency in our emergency room, which we were thinking that maybe it disrupted, our emergency room activities actually up. Over 2019, many categories of our business, as I mentioned on the call compared to 2019, have shown a nice, stable response. So we're still trying to sort out a few things with the pandemic and don't necessarily have great insights yet around some of those. But we do feel confident that healthcare demand in general will revert back to normal patterns as we move through the next few years.
A.J. Rice: All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Pito Chickering: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Also going on the labor question, sort of a two-part question. The first one is, I think about your contract labor rates, how much visibility that have and what the rates you paying in the third quarter and views as it goes in the fourth quarter. And can sort of quantify to what contract labor you paid in 2Q, when you assume within guidance and then in 3Q? And then on the full time labor, can you guys gives any color on sort of what is your average hourly nursing wages in first quarter and how that went sort of in the second quarter? Are we seeing a downtick as you guys bring on a new nurse’s school? Thanks so much.
William Rutherford: Yes, Pito, this is Bill. Let me start first with the contract labor. I think, as we discussed last quarter, it was at a peak high in the first quarter really due to the COVID services. And we anticipated to be able to see sequential improvement. And indeed, that's what we saw. We thought it would first start with being able to modify the rates that we were seeing in the market in terms of the average hourly rate, and indeed, we saw that and we were able to execute on that as the quarter went through. We finished with June. We were anticipating when we reset our guidance after the first quarter. And I think over the course of the year, we'll continue to see hopefully reduction in the utilization of that contract labor. And again, we were encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw, we're encouraged by kind of how we ended the quarter in the month of June. So that's pretty much in line with what we anticipated.
Samuel Hazen: Yes, I think the -- and Pito, this is Sam. The contract labor rate itself, we do believe there's still some room to go. When we look at where we ended the quarter, I don't have a specific number that I think it makes sense to give you at this point. But we do anticipate some continued improvement on the rate and as Bill mentioned the equalization. As it relates to our nurses and our full-time nurses, we last year about this time, did a fairly sizable market adjustment across the organization. And since then, we've continued to do very targeted adjustments for our nurses as well as our non-nurses, because we need lab techs, radiology techs, and other people to support the care delivery process. Again, we are making another market adjustment this year. I will tell you that our nurse wage increase is in the mid-single-digit. It's manageable for us we believe. We've been able to maintain productivity levels in certain instances. And we've been able to arbitrage, if you will, the very expensive contract labor. And that's allowed us to position our workforce better in the second quarter than we did in the previous three quarters. So we continue to believe that there is opportunity on that front. We see the market for labor moderating some and normalizing our turnover, as I mentioned, is down over 20% in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter are hiring in a recruitment function, which has done a wonderful job is up 18% in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter. So these metrics, early successes, if you will, give us some confidence that the combination of our compensation strategies, our retention strategy, and then the mix of our labor and workforce should improve as we move through the balance of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Ann Hynes: Hi, good morning. I know it might be early, but how do you think we should think about key inflationary pressures for 2023 versus several trends, especially with age applies? And on the managed care side, I know that you will eventually be able to pass some of these inflationary pressures through pricing. Can you just give us some timing on how we should think about that? Thanks.
Samuel Hazen: This is Sam, let me speak to inflation. Generally, obviously, we are seeing inflation as we mentioned inside of our labor costs. Again, I just give you an overview of how we think we're managing our way through that. And Bill can speak to some of the specifics on the supply side. Fortunately, in many areas, we have contracts that have terms to them today. So it gives us some protection in the short run. We think protection allows us to reposition some of our pricing as we move through the next few years to reflect more accurately the inflationary pressures that we're seeing and others are seeing in the provider system. We're seeing some early success and recognition by the payers. And we expect the payers to appreciate the overall inflationary environment that the providers are in, but we're seeing some early recognition of that and some renegotiated contract have reflected more escalation in pricing than what we had seen in our past trends. As I mentioned on the last call, we're pretty much contracted for 2022, obviously, but as we look to 2023, we'll start to see some uplift in our contract pricing, reflecting the new contracts. And then on '24, we fully anticipate having a different trend on our pricing as a result of these renegotiations. On our capital costs, we obviously experienced some inflationary pressures there. I don't know that we have visibility at this point to give you any number on any of those we think about 2023. So we'll try to hone in on that a little bit more as we get ready for our guidance in the next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with SVB Securities. Your line is open.
Whit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Bill, the AR days jumped up again this quarter. I'm just trying to understand like what's driving that is that higher payer claim edits, is there any underlying deterioration in collection rates, just anything to put that into context? And if you could sort of describe how that track relative to your expectations, and if I could also just get the -- I don't know if I got the call for FTE number in the quarter. Maybe you shared it, but I missed it. But that'd be helpful. Thanks.
William Rutherford: Yes, Whit. We have seen some increase in AR days as we've gone through the year. Part of that is prior period during COVID, I think the payers have kind of turned off many of their bill edits, we've seen some of those come back into play. Pretty much in line with what we anticipated, we're hoping the kind of at a high mark right now, we'll continue to see improvement as we go through the year. But we are seeing a little bit more kind of delays in the payment processing cycle. And we're working through that with our payers. In terms of the cost per FTE, we saw again sequential improvement in the quarter compared to the first quarter recall in the first quarter, we ran pretty high. I think it was almost a 7% year-over-year number, more now in the 4.5% for the second quarter. And so it was tracking about what we anticipated as we ended the first quarter.
Whit Mayo: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with -- I'm sorry Whit Mayo.
Samuel Hazen: Gary Taylor.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Taylor with Cowen. Your line is open.
Gary Taylor: Hi, can you hear me?
Samuel Hazen: Yes.
Gary Taylor: Okay. Just the two parter, both of which you've just touched on a little bit, I just wanted to make sure I understood if you'd provide a little more color. I think we sort of triangulated in the first quarter, somewhere north of $600 million of contract labor spend. And I know that's down and you said it was down you said was in June, but just wondering kind of where that ran for the quarter, just to help us sort of modeling the rest of the year. And then the second parter is with the AR growth and also payables down, you've done $3 billion cash from Ops in the first half in the annual guide is 9% to 9.5%. So, despite the payer edits and so forth, you still feel good about the cash from Ops number for the year?
William Rutherford: Yes, Gary let me start with the cash flow process, it's Bill. We're continuing to look at that, I think it's probably going to be hovering around the 8%, maybe 8.5% level somewhere in between those. And we'll continue to track that as the year goes on. But I still think that's a very strong number for us and allows us to kind of execute on all aspects of our capital allocation philosophy. When you look at the contract labor piece, we did see sequential improvement, the actual dollars amount were down from where we were in the first quarter, and we're looking at contract labor as a percent of SWB, we finished at the end of the quarter of the month of June, down just above 8% where in the first quarter, we were running 9%, 9.2%. So again, we saw I think nice improvement in the absolute contract labor numbers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Joanna Gajuk: Good morning, actually, this is Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today, so thanks for taking the question here. So I guess the first question and then I have a follow-up too but in terms of looking at I know you maybe it's early to talk about next year, but you obviously kept your guidance positive, given the expectation here. This year has some benefits right from sequestration PHE being extended. So how should we think about, roughly speaking from going from here, is this year a good base to grow off of your long-term kind of targeted growth rate? And my follow-up question in terms of the commercial pricing discussion that you highlighted in terms of the improvement over time. So is it fair to assume when you look at the history, right of the company, should we expecting commercial that would be accelerated to say, 4%, 5% at some point, like we saw in the past, we're in a period of high cost inflation. Thank you.
William Rutherford: Well, let me make sure I got that, relative to 2023, and kind of the plusses and minuses as we go through the year. Yes, we are anticipating as we go through the balance of this year, kind of the normal course of business has stabilized, as Sam mentioned in his comments, we think we're going to see patterns return to kind of their normal seasonal trend. And so that should give us a good base to grow off of in 2023. It's a little early to be talking about all the variables in 2023. We're going to be approaching our planning process right now. But most of them are no. And I think, as Sam mentioned in his earlier comments, we think fundamentally, there continues to be growing demand for healthcare in our markets. And we're well positioned to serve that. And I think that becomes a nice place to think about 2023 in as we go forward. Relative to commercial pricing, as he said and as we mentioned before, we are having those discussion with the payers, we've had some early success, there's a recognition of the inflationary pressures that providers are seeing. So we'll continue to progress those discussions as we go forward. And hopefully we'll continue to roll those and get to benefit in '23.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on a couple of numbers questions. First, on COVID, I know you had expected the PHE earlier to expire, like almost in the first half. I think your number was about $150 million of that. Can you give us an updated number there in terms of what's in guidance, then on that total pricing, I know it's early, and you've got some wins there, hopefully. But can you give us an idea of pricing, I think was in a 4% to 5% range historically. Where do you think those contracts shakeout in terms of, as we do get through them, they may shake up the high single-digits or something a little bit lower than that. And that's it for me.
Samuel Hazen: Yes, Justin let me start with your first one relative to the various COVID support. Honestly, very little did we recognized in the first quarter, probably $20 million to $25 million. You look at last year, you guys probably hovering around $140 million in a quarter, pretty much in line with what our expectations were most of those programs have pretty much concluded. And so we'll run this out. I think it's probably $200 million year-to-date. So that's pretty close to what we anticipated, when we turn the calendar and expectations relative to pricing. I think it's reasonable to assume that we were in 3.5% to 4% zone previously with our commercial pricing, that we are going to be in the mid-single-digits as it relates to our expectations, how all those land, we don't know yet, we believe again with transparency in such that we're in a competitive positioning as a company globally. And that allows us to negotiate based upon the inflationary pressures, reasonable escalator as I mentioned. So that's sort of our targets. We're still early as our contracts come up for renewal. And we need to understand where the payers think we are aware they are in their planning as well. And I believe our relationships will allow us to get to a number that makes sense for both organizations. But I do anticipate it being somewhere around the mid-single-digits.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Ben Hendrix: Hey, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a capital deployment question now ex-these Utah hospital acquisitions, given the FTC challenge, does this change at all your strategy or impede the strategy of accessing patient access points in market? Could this potentially mean that we might look at some larger health system acquisitions in new markets. So just any thoughts on that? Thanks.
Samuel Hazen: I don't think the decision in Utah necessarily changes our overall outlook, we will continue to look for opportunities that are appropriate in market, most of us tend to be ambulatory oriented, where we're able to add to our networks, just this past quarter, we acquired another urgent care company in our Virginia division. And it's solidified our network capabilities offerings in that particular state, just like we've done previously in Florida. So we'll continue to look for outpatient network development opportunities. A lot of that will be our own Greenfield projects, but it may be some acquisition opportunities here and there. As it relates to markets, clearly, we're interested in new markets, we think we have the organizational capability and the financial capability to create a lot of value in the communities across the country. And hopefully, we will see some opportunities on that front, we're fortunate to be in a position where we have solid organic growth opportunities, given the markets that we serve. And so we will continue to invest in those. I think in general, our capital allocation strategies will remain consistent. We have a very diversified approach to capital allocation. And we all continue to use that model for delivering shareholder value as well as making sure our networks are sufficiently developed with capacity in different offerings.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Sam, you mentioned in your prepared remarks how you opened three new Galen nursing schools this past quarter. So there's a lot of chatter about how difficult it is to add nursing school capacity here in the U.S. Just curious in terms of how you're thinking about the ability to add more locations, based on availability of professors and licenses to add to the nursing capacity in HCA?
Samuel Hazen: Thank you. I think the acquisition of Galen has yielded since we closed on that transaction, we've added eight new schools. And in most circumstances, those schools have started with a moment that was ahead of our model. Part of our ability to expand and open new colleges as efficiently and effectively, as Galen has far is really reflective of a unique model they have where they standardize the facility. They standardize the curriculum in the delivery, what's unique about HCA and Galen together is that we can use some of our own staff to support faculty needs in some cases, and then obviously create very efficient and effective clinical rotations. We are up to 13 schools. We will open like I said a couple more this year, and I think our pipeline has six to eight over the following 12 to 18 months. Our vision is that all of our major communities will have at least one Galen College of Nursing as part of the overall network offering, some communities because of their size will probably have more than one. So we're extremely encouraged. I have visited myself three of our new schools. There's tremendous enthusiasm with the students. There's tremendous enthusiasm with the faculty and their tremendous enthusiasm with our nursing leadership across the company about the unique possibilities, that the integration of nursing education with clinical operations in facilities as sort of an integrated model is something that is differentiated and it's going to create better nurses, better value for the patient, and we think it supply for HCA facilities that you need in most circumstances.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Joshua Raskin: Thanks, good morning. Are there certain parts of the healthcare delivery ecosystem that you think are more attractive now that you're talking about the sort of new stabilization, that that just haven't been as attractive in the past. Are there areas of growth for HCA in the future that you just haven't looked at in the past?
Samuel Hazen: I don't think there's anything that's completely changed. Obviously, outpatient facilities, pre-pandemic were very important aspects to our network. We have roughly 2,500 outpatient facilities that are part of our hospital network ecosystem. So it's about what 12:1 in our company. We were very intentional over the last decade in building out our outpatient network to support our hospitals, which is sort of the core of who we are. And that integrated network model, we think was very effective, and very supportive and our ability to go from 23% market share in 2011 to 28% market share today. As we push forward into the future, I do anticipate more velocity, if you will, and the network development we've had previously. But that really is across all aspects of outpatient development. Our philosophy is to create convenience for the patient, efficiency for the patient with different price points, and then integration with a full system approach, so that the patient can get whatever services they need inside of our overall provider system. I don't know that anything is uniquely differentiated in that though, and I think it takes a comprehensive and complementary approach to be most effective and most responsive to our patients and our physicians.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Lance Wilkes: Yes, thanks a lot. Just wanted to understand a little bit about kind of volume constraints that have been in place during COVID. And including labor supply constraints, and maybe how you track those metrics to see if those are starting to kind of loosen up a little bit, that the aiding volume in addition to just normal resumption of volume trends out there. So how are you looking at it? And what are some of the steps you're taking to kind of improve labor supply there?
Samuel Hazen: Well, let me speak to our occupancy. This is Sam again, we ran about 72% occupancy in the second quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we did open up more capacity than we had in the first quarter, we were a bit constrained with staffing. We had surgeons we were dealing with. So our overall availability of capacity was not as much as it was in the second quarter. In the second quarter, however, we did have periods of time, where our staffing constrained our capacity, and we weren't able to take transfers and through our transfer centers, which are a very important element of our network that I just talked about, with our network model. And we saw situations where we couldn't take patients in certain facilities at certain times. It wasn't structural, but it was episodic in how much activity we had at a particular facility at a particular point in time, as well as the staffing. Our overall staffing supply agenda, I've spoken to that already around recruitment, retention, different care models that we're trying to use and managing our case management capabilities at a totally different level. We've seen improve every one of those categories, and that's helped us stretch our capacity, if you will, in appropriate ways that deliver outcomes for patients that are appropriate. So we'll continue to move on all of those initiatives. And we think it will allow us over time to continue to open up more and more capacity. We've seen a lot pressure in our behavioral health services, where we have a reasonable number of facilities that are operating less than at full capacity, we've had the same thing in our rehab services. And we had the same thing in other aspects of our business. But again, it's improved sequentially. And we think it will continue to improve as we move through the year. Does that significantly compromise our volume? No. But it does create some opportunities for more volume as we manage through those initiatives.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. I was interested if you can give us your perspectives on the evolving primary care environment, just with all the focus on value based care and then and with the emergence of some new players in the space, I guess, including yesterday. And then for HCA, how you think that could impact physician recruitment or network development longer term? Thanks.
Samuel Hazen: Thank you. This is an interesting point in healthcare, generally speaking, I mean, primary care is a multi-faceted offering. It has urgent care, it has women services, pediatric services, telemedicine, internal medicine, even the emergency room, in some cases serves as a primary care platform for many people. So our approach is to have as many components of the primary care offering set as we possibly can. In some cases that's employed, we have employed physicians. In our physician model, we have our urgent care offerings, we have telemedicine offerings. We have pediatric offerings, and so forth. In many instances as a combination of employee and affiliate physicians or affiliate providers, it could be providers of other urgent care centers, or other physicians and so forth. What's developed with the one medical, it being just another component of a possible affiliated network offering, I don't know that it completely changes the paradigm that exists across the multi-faceted aspects of primary care and how people access care through those different dimensions. So we will continue to have a pluralistic approach to primary care. And we think that's the model that works for us, as pushed through our system approach to healthcare in these communities.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Mason with Raymond James. Your line is open.
John Mason: Hey, good morning. Bill, you said on the first quarter, you thought the kind of short term margin was in the 19% to 20% range with the new realities. As your thinking changed on that?
William Rutherford: No, John, not really. I mean, you look we did I think we did it 19.7 in the first and 20.5 in the second. Obviously, there's pluses and minuses. As you know, there's a lot of variables that go into the actual margin number, and we continue to focus to operate the company as efficiently as possible. But I think that 19 to 20 range is a good planning horizon for us. I think there'll be periods were north of that some periods where within that. So I still think that thinking holds today.
John Mason: Thank you.
William Rutherford: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Stephen Baxter: Yes, hi. The commentary you gave on the non-COVID emission metrics, seems like you're seeing the growth in managed care, but I guess that implies, declines on the government side of the business or the uninsured side of business. I was hoping you could provide some insight into, what you think is driving that differential? And then as a follow-up, just wondering how we should be thinking about the growth of surgical volumes for the balance of the year? Thank you.
William Rutherford: Well, this is Bill, let me start with a non-COVID piece. I think there's a couple of things that play there. One, we did see growth in the non-COVID managed care. And that continued, I think a favorable payer mix during that we were seeing and again, as I said in my remarks, we also saw the acuity levels maintain. So those are two areas that we're focused for us and we were pleased with that. Relative to the governmental activity in a non-COVID. It fluctuates, we are seeing some growth in the Medicare, which is still a good thing for us. Our total Medicare admissions, I think we're at 0.6% for the quarter, but we also saw growth in the managed care side. So I think, ultimately what we expect to see is a return to historical growth patterns and pretty consistent among those payer prices. And as I've talked about in various settings, it may be a return of both governmental payer classes as well as a commercial and net-net those are still positive and productive for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Mok with UBS. Your line is open.
Andrew Mok: Hi, good morning, given the footprint of your hospitals, it seems like you are well positioned to benefit from stronger ACA enrollment helped by enhanced premium tax credits, can you help size the benefit in terms of revenue or volumes from those programs? And how are you thinking about the impact to your business should those enhanced subsidies expire? Thanks.
Samuel Hazen: Yes, that's a great question. And I'm sure paying attention to that. And we have some hope that we'll see those enhanced subsidies have some continuation, and we'll pay attention to that as the year goes on. And we'll try to assess any impact of that in 2023. There's no doubt we talked about that through 2021, we saw growth in the health insurance exchange activity across HCA primarily due to the enrollment increases that we saw on there. So if the subsidies end up being reduced, it would have impact on enrollment, it could have an impact on our volume, we haven't fully sized all of that, we're going to wait to see how the various proposals worked through Congress and the Houses and again, helped get some extension on there. But if we go into '23, that's obviously a key area that we're going to have to focus on kind of soon. But we saw I think, through the course of '21, our health insurance exchange growth, probably 20% to 25% in a given period. And again, I do think that was primarily attributable to the increased enrollment that I think is attributable to the enhanced subsidy. So we'll just have to see how that plays out. We're hopeful that they find ways to continue those and you won't see a drop of people gaining coverage through the health insurance changes we go through the balance of the year.
Andrew Mok: Great, thank you.
Samuel Hazen: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jason Cassorla with Citi. Your line is open.
Jason Cassorla: Great, thanks. Good morning, just with year-to-date CapEx spending close to $2 billion, you're seemingly tracking towards your '22 guidance of $4.2 billion. But I was wondering if your expectations on areas for CapEx allocation for service lines specifically has changed given trends so far, perhaps different service line buildouts, just given the volume and labor backdrop, any help there would be great, thanks.
Samuel Hazen: This is Sam, I don't think we're going to see any material change in how we allocate capital. We believe we have a sufficient allocation around our technology agenda, our outpatient development agenda, and then as I mentioned in my comments, targeted hospital investments to support a growth opportunity or relieve a capacity constraint or really even create a better environment for our patients in some instances. So I don't anticipate significant shifting of categories, we will obviously adjust the overall market demand picture in such from one community to the other and we'll weave into that inside of those categories primarily.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sarah James with Barclays. Your line is open.
Sarah James: Hey, thank you. So if I think about the 10,000 nursing students a year that could be graduating from Galen, how much of those are actually taking full-time positions at HCA? What's your capture rate and then is there anything that you can be doing with tuition reimbursement to try to improve your capture rates?
Samuel Hazen: Well, that's a great question. We're evolving our integration model, as I mentioned with nurse students and externs and rotations and so forth, and it's a little early to give an indication as to what the capture rate will be, if you will, partly due to the fact that the schools are new, and we aren't seeing graduates just yet. We only have two schools today in HCA markets where they're graduating students. And we're improving sequentially our capture rates, use your term in those two schools, and that's in Tampa and San Antonio, where we're seeing more Galen students land in HCA facilities. We have a very robust academic partnership strategy. It's not just Galen, Galen can't solve all of the nursing needs for the organization. They can complement it in a very significant way, as we've mentioned, but our broader academic partnership agenda is working with other great schools out there that provide nursing care. And we think what we can do is learn from our Galen experience and meet with other academic centers more effectively create a better experience for their students, and maybe a better pathway forward into HCA facilities in the future. We do have numerous programs that support HCA colleagues in getting nursing degrees. We have tuition support, we have other programs that create opportunities for our people inside of Galen, and we're continuing to evolve those. But I'm encouraged by some of the early indications of how many HCA colleagues were actually participating in Galen schools now. So we will hopefully see some benefit from that in the future.
Sarah James: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jamie Perse: Hey, good morning. You commented earlier just on your ability to flex and adapt. And you showed that this quarter and really the last couple of years, I'm curious how you think about a recessionary scenario or just lower growth overall, constrained consumers, weaker job growth. How should we be thinking about that type of environment? And what types of things that are in your playbook to adapt to a more challenging macro?
Samuel Hazen: Well, we have gone through numerous recessionary cycles, just as other companies have gone through. And we're preparing ourselves for what that could be, if it does develop in this cycle. And Bill alluded to a number of the programs that we have, trying to make sure our efficiencies and other resiliency items are pushing forward regardless of the circumstance because we see value there and opportunities. I think what is potentially different in a very significant and structural way now is how the Affordable Care Act in exchanges and Medicaid expansion play in a recessionary cycle, we have never had that safety net during that type of cycle. In those past cycles, if a person was lost their job, they went into an uninsured ranks. I think what we have today is a unique safety net for those people in the Affordable Care Act programs that should provide some support by comparison to past cycles. Typically, we lag as many of you know, and how demand behaves in a recessionary cycle, but it provides labor relief also for us. So there's a balance between the two, HCA Healthcare has performed well in past recessionary cycles. And I'm confident that we can perform reasonably well in future recessionary cycles as we get more adaptability in our business and then again, as the Affordable Care Act provides some level of support that we hadn't seen in the past.
Operator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Frank Morgan for closing remarks.
Frank Morgan: Chantel, thank you for your help today. And thanks everyone for joining our call, who gave a wonderful weekend. I'll be around today if I can answer any additional questions you might have. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Frank Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.
Frank Morgan: Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we'll take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may -- we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to influence our results in the first quarter with the Omicron surge, which slowed in the middle of the quarter. More significantly, the challenging labor market pressured margins as the cost of labor increased more than we expected as compared to the first quarter of the prior year. In the face of these challenges, however, we had a number of positive volume and revenue indicators that were encouraging. Compared to the first quarter of prior year, same-facility admissions increased 2%. During the quarter we provided care to approximately 49,000 COVID-19 inpatients, which represented approximately 10% of total admissions, consistent with prior year. Non-COVID admissions grew 2.2%. This growth occurred in February and March. Inpatient surgeries grew approximately 1%. And across our inpatient business, acuity levels and payer mix continued to be strong. Outpatient volumes also rebounded strongly in the quarter. Same-facility emergency room visits grew 15%. Same-facility outpatient surgeries grew nearly 7%. And outpatient cardiac-related procedures grew by approximately 7%. We continue to believe that overall demand for health care remains strong in our markets across most categories, with favorable population trends and other contributing factors that developed during the pandemic driving it. Total revenues grew 6.9% compared to the first quarter 2021. Same-facility inpatient revenues grew 5.4%. And same-facility outpatient revenues grew 10.6%. Bill will provide more color on our revenues in his comments. I realize that our bottom line financial results were not what we expected, but these top line metrics were positive. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales of facilities, were $4.12, which was down $0.02 from the prior year. In the quarter, we experienced higher levels of contract labor expenses than planned. As compared to the fourth quarter, we saw modest improvements in certain contract labor metrics. We expect further improvements in the remainder of the year as we align the workforce appropriately by reducing both the utilization of contract labor and the associated hourly rates for these contracts. In some situations, the challenges in the labor market also constrained our capacity, preventing us from delivering hospital services to certain patients. By the end of the quarter, we were able to overcome some of these capacity constraints. And for the most part, our transfer centers were able to operate normally and move more patients to the proper setting in our networks. It is important to understand, we are doing what we absolutely have to do to take care of our patients, and we will always do that. This past quarter, our teams continued to show up and deliver on our promise to provide high-quality care to patients who need our services. I want to thank them for their commitment and hard work during these challenging times. We do, however, have numerous initiatives underway around retention, recruitment, capacity management and new care models that we believe will help offset some of these labor pressures. However, we now believe improvement in our labor cost will be slower than originally anticipated. This factor primarily influenced our revised outlook for 2022. We will continue to invest in our people, in our relationships and in our networks. We believe these investments are appropriate and should help us address the long-term opportunities for growth that exists in our markets. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 2,500 facilities or sites of care in HCA Healthcare networks. This represents a 15% increase over last year. Recently, we published our Annual Impact Report for 2021, which highlights the tremendous impact our colleagues had on the patients and communities we serve. You can find the details on our website. Before I turn the call over to Bill, let me end my comments with this. Over the past few years, we have demonstrated an ability to adjust effectively to whatever our realities are, and I'm confident we will do it again.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Thank you.
Bill Rutherford: Okay. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments for the quarter and then address our 2022 updated guidance. First, let me provide a little more commentary on our revenues in the quarter. We are encouraged with certain trends we saw in our non-COVID activity during the quarter. Same-facility non-COVID admissions grew 2.2% versus the prior year, and our non-COVID revenue per admission grew 2.4% as a result of maintaining our acuity levels and a slightly favorable payer mix as compared to the prior year. Within our COVID activity, our same-facility COVID emissions were slightly above last year and represented approximately 10% of our total admissions, but we did see lower acuity and intensity with the Omicron variant this year. Our COVID inpatient revenue per admission was down approximately 15% from the first quarter of last year, which resulted in approximately $150 million less COVID revenue this year as compared to the first quarter of last year. Let me transition to discuss some cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Our cash flow from operations was $1.345 billion as compared to $2 billion in the first quarter of 2021. We did pay $344 million of deferred payroll taxes from 2020 during this quarter, representing 50% of the total amount deferred. Capital spending was $860 million as compared to $650 million in the prior year period, and we completed just over $2.1 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was slightly below the low end of our target range, and we had just under $7.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. We plan to use approximately $2.6 billion of this amount to redeem our 2023 bonds in the second quarter. Finally, I will mention, as noted in our release this morning, during March of this year, CMS approved the direct to payment portion of the Texas Waiver Program. As a result, we recognized $385 million of revenue and $160 million of additional provider tax assessments related to this portion of the program from the period September 1, '21 through March 31, 2022. Of these amounts, approximately $244 million of the revenue and $90 million of the provider tax assessments related to the September through December of '21 period. As noted in our release this morning, we are adjusting our full year 2022 guidance as follows: We expect revenues to range between $59.5 billion and $61.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.95 billion and $5.34 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $11.8 billion and $12.4 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $16.40 and $17.60. And we expect capital spending to remain at $4.2 billion for the year. So let me provide some additional commentary on our adjusted guidance and 3 primary areas that we have considered. First, our cost of labor was higher than anticipated in the first quarter, primarily due to the utilization and cost of contract labor. We now believe the disruption of the labor market and the pressure this places on labor cost inflation will be slower to moderate than we originally anticipated. Second, as I previously discussed, we saw reduced acuity and revenue from Omicron COVID patients in the quarter, and this lower acuity has been factored into our guidance as well. And lastly, we made assumption around increased inflationary pressures and expect that to have greater impact on us going forward, including for professional fees, energy procurement, cost of utilities and other purchase services. So let me close with a brief discussion on some of the initiatives we have underway to respond to these current market dynamics. We've spoken in the past of our resiliency efforts, which now include 3 main focus areas. First is around staffing and capacity, as Sam mentioned in his comments. We have teams working on and focused on multiple work streams in this category. These work streams is centered around investing in and enhancing employee recruitment and retention efforts and enhancing capacity management through new case management models and technology solutions. In addition, we are exploring new delivery models through our care transformation initiatives. All of these are focused on supporting our care teams and easing some of the current labor pressures. Second, we have our original resiliency programs that are continuing. Many of these are advancing efficiencies through our next generation of shared services. Examples of these include a consolidation and alignment of laboratory operations, facility management, environmental and food and nutrition support areas. And then the third major effort underway is an initiative around advancing our capability to benchmark key performance metrics across the organization. This is intended to identify variation and opportunity to see our best practices across several areas, such as supply utilization, provider support costs, discretionary spending and other similar cost area. Many of these were factored into our original planning assumptions, and we remain focused on these efforts to help offset some of the contract labor and inflationary cost pressures we are experiencing. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank to open it up for Q&A.
Frank Morgan: Thank you, Bill. [Operator Instructions] Emma, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice : Maybe just try to drill down a little bit more on -- I know within the range, you've changed your outlook for EBITDA by about $650 million at the high end, $750 million at the low end. There's a lot of moving parts in the first quarter with what's happening with Texas supplemental payments. Can you tell us how much of that adjustment was due to what you saw in the first quarter? And how much is changing in your thinking for the rest of the year? And particularly, maybe just drill down on the labor comments about maybe what you were thinking before versus what you're thinking today in terms of use of contract labor rates and so forth, if there's anything that can be shared there.
Bill Rutherford: Yes, A.J., this is Bill. Let me give that a shot. So as we're looking forward and we're trying to take what we saw in the first quarter to make some assumptions and revision of our assumptions going forward, let's talk about the 3 areas. And first, as I mentioned, the pressure on the labor cost that what we're seeing is it's higher than we originally planned. It's primarily related to the use of contract labor. But we're also adjusting our base wage just to be responsive to the market as well. As I would think about it, our original plans was to kind of manage our overall cost per FTE somewhere between that 3% and 3.5% level. What we saw in the first quarter is our cost per FTE was about 1.5% higher than we expected. So as we forecast this going forward for the balance of the year, it could have a $400 million to $500 million impact. So we factored that into our guidance. The second area is regarding the Omicron variant, the less acuity in revenue, not only that we saw in the first quarter, but to the extent that we continue to see some COVID at a reduced level than what we saw in the first quarter, we factored that in. And then lastly, as I mentioned, just some inflationary increases above what we originally anticipated. So I think the way I would characterize it, approximately 2/3 of our revision, I would apply to kind of our wage and inflationary cost pressures and 1/3 of that due to the revenue acuity primarily to the COVID patients.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Pito Chickering: Embedded on the guidance reduction, can you walk us through the contract labor percent of nursing hours in fourth quarter, in the first quarter and how you assume that rolls off throughout the year. And then the same question on the rates for contract labor. And just because stocks had a big move today, any chance you guys can give us sort of a range for how we should be modeling 2Q EBITDA?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Peter, let me give a shot at that. I think we talked about on our fourth quarter call, our contract labor as a percent of nursing hours was around 11%. In the first quarter, it's about that level, too. We were 11.4% specifically in the fourth quarter, about 11.6% in the second quarter. We are experiencing elevated cost per hour of that contract labor, principally, we believe, related to the COVID surges. Our plans going forward are to continue to reduce the utilization of that contract labor and eventually moderate the average hourly rate that we're having to spend for that contract labor. But we think that moderation will be slower than we originally anticipated. So that's what's based in our assumptions, and it's basically influenced with what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Sam Hazen: Yes. And let me add to that, Pito, this is Sam. I think as we have gone through 2 years of up and down periods with surges, short-cycle normal period surges, another short-cycle normal period, we saw in the surges an acceleration in both turnover and the use of contract labor. As I mentioned on my prepared comments, we do what we got to do to take care of our patients. What we're anticipating is no more significant surges as we move through the rest of this year. And we -- that gives us some opportunity and some level of confidence that we can moderate the use of contract labor. And some of our other initiatives should provide support, recruitment, some of our retention efforts and so forth, giving us an opportunity to wean ourselves off the high levels of contract labor. And we saw that in the short cycles to a certain degree, but we never were able to sustain it simply because it was just that, a short cycle. So as we go through the rest of this year, we think the cycle will be longer with respect to those surge, and that will give us an opportunity to gain some traction with some of these initiatives. Our teams are working diligently across the facilities to make this happen. And again, I'm confident, just as we've done in the past, that we can make these adjustments over time and get us to where we need to be.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: First, just a quick follow-up on Pito's question. Can you give us a number as to where you expect to end the year on contract labor as a percentage? And just to confirm, does that sit in operating expense or other operating? Because that was the line item that looks like it was a bit off. And then my actual question is, Sam, just as you take a step back, right, there was a huge improvement in margins during COVID. It looks like they take a step back here. I'm just curious, do you think this is a sustainable margin or a sustainable EBITDA level to kind of think about jumping off for next year? Or do you think some of those improvements could help you close the gap versus where you were when you guided the year originally?
Bill Rutherford: Justin, this is Bill. Let me start with the first part of that. Without giving any specific numbers, you've heard us talk about, we expect to decrease the utilization. If I look before COVID, we will be hovering around 9% to 10% of ours. I don't know exactly, there are so many uncertainties, but we expect it to sequentially improve going forward. That does come through the SWB line, not the other operating. You did mention the other operating. It was primarily influenced with the provider tax assessments that I mentioned in my prepared remarks.
Sam Hazen: Yes. This is Sam, Just. With respect to the margins in the first quarter, I think the margins in the first quarter were clearly pressured, as we've indicated here, with somewhat unprecedented levels of cost on the labor side. We -- again, those costs were driven in some respects by the surge that we were reacting to and that pressured in a very significant way. I do believe, over time, we can recover some of that lost margin as we continue to appropriately align our workforce with more permanent workforce or more efficient workforce coming from the contract labor category. As -- setting a target, we don't necessarily have a target for contract labor. Obviously, in 2019, we were maybe half of what we're running today, somewhere in that zone. I don't know if that's realistic in the short run. But I'm hopeful in the intermediate run, with the number of initiatives that we have plus our Galen College of Nursing expansion program, that we can start to get back to those kind of levels. But I do think the first quarter was uniquely pressured from a margin standpoint simply because of the elevated levels of contract labor and the costs thereof.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Just want to maybe follow up on that question there. I think last quarter, you were talking about something like a 20% to 21% margin as kind of ultimately being sustainable. Is that the right way to think about it? Or have some of these things changed your view? And it sounds like, for the most part, you talked about recapturing margin, you're talking about cost savings. Is there anything on the rate side that is part of that equation? And if so, does that take a couple of years to play out? Or is that something that we can think about more normalized margins as soon as next year?
Bill Rutherford: Well, Kevin, if you look at our guidance, I think it would imply close to those 20% margin levels. Obviously, we've had to adjust some of our thinking, given kind of these inflationary cost pressures that we're seeing. So we're doing everything we can to operate the company as efficiently as possible. There's a lot of variables that we know go into margin. Volume, acuity, payer mix, continuing to manage our cost structures appropriately. So I would use that 19% to 20% level in the short run. And over time, we're going to continue to find ways to continue to operate efficiently.
Sam Hazen: On the payer contract, we are having more discussions. Obviously, the payers understand the inflationary pressures that providers have. And there's early discussions. It doesn't change our revenue mix in the 2022 period because we're largely contracted for 2022. But as we move into 2023 and 2024, Kevin, we have opportunities to utilize our payer contracts to get some relief from the inflationary pressures. And as we further our discussions with those commercial payers, I'm optimistic that we can gain some escalators that are more in line with the inflationary pressures of today versus the inflationary pressures of the past.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with SVB Securities.
WhitMayo: Bill, what are you assuming in your algorithm this year for the guidance around COVID and non-COVID? I think you were assuming non-COVID was going to be, I don't know, 2% to 3% of the total. How has that shifted? And is there anything that you can share on how non-COVID, either inpatient, outpatient or anything, is tracking through April, that might just give us a sense of the run rate.
Bill Rutherford: I can't say April, Whit, at this point. But we said in our prepared remarks, non-COVID was up 2.2%. And that was really in February and March. In February and March, we were seeing 4.5% to 5%, potentially in those levels. So again, that's why I said we're encouraged by those trends. I don't think really what we saw in the fourth quarter really in broad terms affect our volume outlook. We still see good volume demand in the marketplaces. So originally, we said 2% to 3% volume growth, COVID still being between that, maybe 3% to 5% of our total admissions. And I think right now, I think that's mostly in line with our current expectations.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.
Ben Hendrix: Just a real quick follow-up on the comment you made just a second ago, Sam, about improving efficiency of contract labor. We've always kind of characterized this as kind of the labor backdrop as the contract being the kind of transitory piece and wage inflation being more permanent. Is that -- can we read that kind of improving efficiency comment is maybe your expectation that contract labor utilization at higher rates is more of a permanent construct now going forward in the labor market?
Sam Hazen: Well, I think it's hard than it was in 2019. I don't think it will be hard than it was in the fourth quarter or the first quarter. I think rates will naturally come down as the surges subside and as workforce is aligned with more permanent staff and so forth. And so we're dealing in the first quarter and the fourth quarter and a little bit in the third quarter as well very high cost per hour for contract labor. And we do not believe that is sustainable. And so we're anticipating improvements in that. Additionally, I think we will see reductions in the number of contract labor personnel that we use. Again, as our initiatives gain traction, we've invested heavily in our recruiting function and really improved the candidate experience inside of that. We have some improving retention efforts and compensation programs that we think are going to support that component of our set of initiatives. So all of that leads us to believe that we can get the cost per FTE down from where it was in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And so that's our thinking.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho.
Ann Hynes: Can you tell us -- when I look at inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions versus 2019, they're still down about 3%. Can you tell us what's embedded in guidance for 2022 versus the 2019 baseline trends, please?
Bill Rutherford: Ann, this is Bill. So as I mentioned before, we still believe we'll end up seeing 2% to 3% admissions for the full year '22. You're right, we are down a little on '19. I'd have to take a moment to see what that represents in ‘19, it's about 1% is what I think that would be our '21 number versus the baseline '19, would be down about 1%.
Sam Hazen: Yes, let me color that a little bit more, Bill, if I may, please. I think a couple of things when it comes to our same-store 2019 versus our same-store 2021. Our uninsured volumes are down 11% from 2019. So that's a very significant point. The second point I would say is we've had a fairly significant shift of orthopedic total joint surgeries go from inpatient to outpatient from 2019 to 2022. Again, that's put pressure on the admissions. Our surgeries were actually up over 2019. And then again, with our emergency room visits, if you look at the categories that are the paying categories were slightly up, but our uninsured activities were way down. So I think you got to look at the components of the business and understand the different components. And so the mix, slightly better shift inpatient to outpatient, which we've talked about over the last couple of years, and that influences the 2022 to 2019 comparison.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Cowen.
Gary Taylor: Wanted to think about seasonality of revenue and EBITDA if -- if you can here. Do we go back to sort of pre COVID and think about first quarter, fourth quarter EBITDA always being higher? Or do we think about J&J and some of the other device companies have said all-time high cancellations in January, things really started improving in March and April. And then obviously, you've got some anticipation that labor cost could ease a bit sequentially. So are we back to normal EBITDA seasonality yet? Or is the year still more complex? And can you help us a little.
Sam Hazen: I think a couple of things, Gary. Thank you for that question. The seasonality, we talked about this in the fourth quarter call, was really difficult for us to discern because, again, we were weaning ourselves off the Delta variant and then ramping up on the Omicron variant. I think the seasonality again, with our volume, is a bit uncertain to us right now. My sense is this could be a more normal period on seasonality for volume in 2022 than any that we've had over the last 2 years, obviously. But the seasonality on our costs, as we've indicated, I think are going to be different. And they're going to be different because we're at a high watermark on labor cost per FTE in the first quarter. And typically, our costs would go up seasonally. But we think as we work through the initiatives and the alignment of our workforce, we'll have a different pattern to our cost in 2022 than what we've had in previous years. And then hopefully, 2023 gets back to normal. So that's how we're thinking about it. Obviously, there's still months to come here for us to understand, in fact, if that does play out, but that's our thinking at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Sam, just to -- follow-up some questions on labor rate? So one question we're getting asked is, why now? Like you guys have done a great job managing through labor over the last 1.5 years? And maybe any color you can share on what you're thinking in terms of turnover on your perm nurses. And then I guess for Bill, to follow up to that, is you called out acuity as a driver of the revenue guidance cut. But as we pull back on temp staff, is there going to be an impact in labor -- or on volumes that we should be thinking about?
Sam Hazen: So the first half of last year, our costs were not in what I call an elevated state from the labor. And we mentioned this on our third quarter call, we also mentioned it again on the fourth quarter call and now we're mentioning it on the first quarter call. So we're working ourselves out of some comparisons, number one. But our costs of labor were dramatically disrupted in the Delta variant for a couple of reasons. One, we jumped our census from the second quarter to the third quarter by 8.5%. We had record census levels in the company in the third quarter. Not for the third quarter, but forever. And that forced us to respond to those patients in an appropriate way. The market -- the labor market was being tremendously impacted during the summer of 2021. And we had to use more contract labor at that time than we had in previous periods. Well, that's continued into the fourth quarter and then to the first quarter. Again, we think some of that is influenced significantly by the surges. So that's part of what reoccurred. As Bill alluded to it, the Delta variant was the most intense revenue patient population that we had. So the third quarter covered a lot of that cost because the revenue intensity of the Delta patients was quite high. The fourth quarter had a blend of Delta and Omicron and it still was higher than the first quarter. And so the labor costs really haven't changed per FTE in 3 quarters. I'm considering that to be a good thing. And I'm also considering it to be the opportunity because we're using too much contract labor and it's still at elevated outsized rates. And so our rate trend has continued in the quarter to be reduced. I think our contract labor cost per hour in the first quarter was down 5% from the fourth quarter. And within the quarter -- within the first quarter, it was better each month, month over month. Again, it gives us some confidence that the assumptions we're making for the remainder of the year are reasonable. So that's part of why it doesn't look like we manage through it in historical ways. Our productivity is at a very efficient level when it comes to employees per patient. So we're managing on that front as well as we possibly can. And as, again, we get these other underlying initiatives into a normal period hopefully of no COVID surges, we're going to gain ground on the pressure that we've experienced over the past 3 quarters.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Brian, you got a follow-up question. As I think Sam mentioned, too, in his comments, there's always the potential where the labor pressures could affect your volume. What we've seen now is in COVID surges as we manage through transfers, again, I think as Sam alluded in his comments, at the end of the quarter, we were really back to our normal levels, but we're continuing to manage through that dynamic.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens.
Scott Fidel : So we just had the Medicare IPPS proposal [contract] for 2023 and certainly had a couple of different moving pieces on that. So I thought it would be helpful if you can give us the gross versus net sort of projection for your rates from that proposal. And then just more broadly, how you feel about CMS sort of factoring in this inflationary pressure and ultimately if you think that CMS will start to factor that in more accurately as we look out maybe to FY '24 and beyond.
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Scott, this is Bill. I mean, obviously, we're still assessing it. But I think on first blush, we thought kind of the gross increase we saw would be hovering just under 2%. That's pretty consistent with what we've seen. But I think to your point, it does get netted out when we see the delay in the sequestration cuts out there. So we'll still assess that. So it may move it closer to flat net-net all-in, but we're seeing at the top line just under 2% growth on that. And so we'll see how the final rule comes out as we go through comments.
Sam Hazen: Yes. And in forward years, typically, it takes a little bit for the wage index to be adjusted to reflect what's going on in the industry. So I think as '21 and '22 start to get baked into the formula for inflation around the wage indexes of the hospital industry, it will start to influence the reimbursement in slightly different ways.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok with UBS.
Andrew Mok: Just wanted to follow up on the revenue commentary. Can you take us through the components of the lower revenue guidance in more detail, maybe help bucket the $500 million decline between volume, acuity and mix. And are there any other government-related items that you would call out in that revenue decline?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Andrew, this is Bill. I would tell you it's principally related to the drop in the COVID acuity that I mentioned in my comments. And we're estimating it to be approximately $150 million in the quarter. COVID, obviously, was higher at 10% of our admissions than we expect in the full year. But if you run that out, I would say the vast majority of that revenue decline would be due to the lower acuity that we're seeing with the Omicron variant and expect to see going forward. And outside of that, there's no other really major item that I would call out, just the ebb and flow of kind of normal volume patterns.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.
Stephen Baxter: Just wanted to ask another one on the labor market. So I'm sure part of your process around this issue involves a great degree of competitive intelligence about what's going on in our markets. I was hoping you could share a little bit about what you're seeing from your local market competitors and whether there are strategies around contract labor or employed labor forward, so even maybe potentially putting certain service lines on pause or maybe exacerbating some of the pressures you're feeling. I guess, big picture, do you think they're being as disciplined as you are? And if not, how should we think about the longer-term implications of that?
Sam Hazen: So from a competitive standpoint, I mean, obviously, our wage programs have to be competitive. And that means different things in different circumstances. And we have made adjustments to our compensation programs, really starting back in the third quarter of '21, to respond to some of the market dynamics. We continue to be very fluid in that particular area of our business in responding to the different circumstances from one market to the other. I would say that we think we're in a pretty good spot. We haven't seen any unusual maneuvers broadly. We are fortunate again to have competitors that tend to be only local and in 1 market or 2 markets at the most. So we don't see sort of patterns that permeate all 43 markets for HCA Healthcare. And so that's a positive on that front. But we haven't seen anything unique yet from the competitive landscape with contract labor and so forth. But I've got to believe that they are facing many of the same challenges as we do. And I believe over time we've been able to use our operating discipline, use our systems, use the learnings that we have across the company to create advantage for us. And I believe we will continue to do that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephro Research.
Joshua Raskin: Quick follow-up on contract labor. How long are those typical contracts in place? And then my real question is, are you having any issues with discharges, post-acute discharges? Is that impacting length of stay, driving up cost and, obviously, the same DRG, the same payment?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Josh, it's Bill. Typically, those contracts range around 13 weeks. So it takes time to adjust. But given the size, they're always flowing through our system on there. And relative to post-acute and discharge planning, I would say, yes. I think that's part of our case management initiatives that I spoke to in my prepared comments. I think the supply and demand dynamics in post-acute, whether it be skilled nursing or other post-acute settings, from time to time can cause a backup in our discharges. And that's why we're trying to advance and utilize some technologies, advance a common organizational structure around case management so we can continue to focus on that and improve that length of stay when patients are ready to go home and there's appropriate levels of discharges. That is a dynamic out there. There's no doubt about it. But I think we're focusing a lot of effort and energy and resources to try to continue to improve in that area.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla with Citi.
Jason Cassorla: I just want to go back to your comments around the initiatives for retention recruitment capacity management and new care models. Can you just help in terms of what is different with these initiatives today maybe compared to perhaps how you utilized these initiatives back in 3Q '21 when labor was picking up. Is it just more intensity there? Or are you leveraging incremental levers that maybe weren't considered or previously -- utilized back then? And then if possible, can you help quantify the offset of these programs or initiatives related to the $400 million to $500 million net pressure regarding the higher wages and costs with the revised guidance?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. I'll start and I'll let Sam kick in. I think it's a mix of both escalating existing initiatives and new ones. One, I'll give an example, and Sam mentioned this earlier, around recruitment. We've increased our investment in recruiter significantly. And that's been a really intentional effort. Same around retention. We're putting common retention strategies across the organization on there. And then the case management that I mentioned in my comments, we recently approved an effort to really align organizationally around our case management strategies. And we're investing in new technologies to give us better predictive assessments of patients' needs at discharge. So it's a combination of accelerating and emphasizing existing efforts as well as implementing new ones. And it kind of touches all bases, if you will, between recruitment, retention, capacity management. And new care models, as you know, can we -- can we bring new support staff to support the care teams, whether it be through patient care techs, through patient safety attendance and the like. So we've got a number of initiatives to try to just, as I said in my comments, continue to support the team and ease those pressures. I would say in our guidance, in our original guidance, we had already factored in some impact of those. And we're going to continue to focus on those to try to, I think, counter some of the market pressures that we are seeing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.
Jamie Perse: Question on volumes. Last year, the timing of the COVID wave was pretty similar to what it looked like this year. You had a really nice acceleration in 2Q last year in terms of volumes across the board. What are you seeing now in terms of volumes? And is last year's experience a good proxy for how we should be thinking about the acceleration into 2Q? And then just one quick follow-up. Can you guys give us what percent of your Managed Care contracts are in place for 2023?
Sam Hazen: So February and March, which were obviously months post Omicron surge, behaved similarly to the holiday surge that occurred at the end of 2020 and on into the first part of 2021. Again, we had solid non-COVID admission growth in February and March, as Bill alluded to, in the mid-single digits. So we're encouraged by that. There's nothing to suggest that the patterns will be different. But again, we're learning, obviously, as we go through these patterns and we're hopeful that we won't have any more surges and we'll be able to judge some of these patterns more effectively. With respect to our payer contracts, we're about 50% contracted for 2023 and about 30% contracted for 2024. Again, those capacities in each of those years give us opportunities to adjust some of the inflationary expectations to the realities that we have today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James of Barclays.
Sarah James: You've been talking about the majority of the pressure being on temp labor, but I was hoping you could unpack that a little bit. Are you talking about 2/3, 1/3 temp labor to kind of the longer-tailed items like wage inflation and bonuses or a more extreme split? And you guys are in a unique position owning a nursing school. So are you seeing any shift in what field students are selecting? And how is that influencing your strategy?
Sam Hazen: I don't know, Bill, if we -- if I have the split right in front of me to be able to answer the first question, but let me speak to the second question. We can get back to you on that first question with a little bit more specificity if we can. It's still early for us with the Galen College of Nursing programs and expansions. But just looking at some of the new schools that we've opened, Austin, Texas, Nashville, Tennessee, parts of South Carolina, the enrollment in a couple of those situations is record level enrollment in nursing program in the Galen College of Nursing. So we've seen a really robust initial enrollment. That gives us confidence. We also believe that we have an opportunity to integrate those students into our organization to support current needs as well as hopefully create synergy as they graduate the program and want to come to work for HCA Healthcare. So we're really encouraged by the prospects. But again, that's more intermediate run, kind of a gain, although there will be some short run with nurse externs and rotations and so forth that we can utilize, hopefully effectively, to support current day needs. But the initial enrollment in a number of these new schools would suggest that there's still a reasonable supply of students who want to go into nursing schools. Maybe circle back to -- I guess -- I think you'll have an answer to your second question.
Bill Rutherford: No, no, I don't have an answer, Sarah. We'll have to get back with you. I think our overall labor mark is a combination of the temporary labor and some of the base wage inflation. I can't split it for you exactly. We'll get back with you on that. But it's a combination of both.
Sarah James: Just to clarify on the nursing school. I was trying to understand like the structural shift that's going on, if your graduating nurses are selecting one field like surgical versus home health versus like if you're seeing just like a structural shift in where graduating nurses are going.
Sam Hazen: No, no, we're not.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.
Matt Borsch: Question is off topic for the quarter, but there's -- I have been following this closely, but there's been obviously an ongoing dialogue around compliance with the price transparency regulations. And I know there's a lot of complexity to the implementation. But can you just address where, from your standpoint, you are with that? And what -- when you would expect to get, if not already, to full compliance on that?
Sam Hazen: Well, I was going to say, we believe we are compliant with the CMS rules, which are tremendously complex and in many ways difficult to implement because of the variations that exist from one commercial contract to another and from one market to another. So we have, through our -- an internal process, established a program that we believe and CMS has validated in certain circumstances, is compliant. And we continue to try to refine those presentations in ways that, again, satisfied CMS' evolving interpretation as well as our ability to adjust some of our postings to meet the evolving requirements.
Frank Morgan : Thank you very much. I'll turn it back over to Emma.
Operator: Your last question today comes from the line of Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.
BenHendrix: Just to get to that 1/3 of the guide down that's related to the lower acuity on COVID volume, is there any way to give us an idea of the margin differential between the lower acuity patients you've seen through Omicron versus COVID patients historically and then versus a non-COVID inpatient admission?
Bill Rutherford: No. I think we'd have to follow up off-line on that. I don't have any specifics in front of me of the specific margins. But I do know when we have the acuity drop like we did, the revenue does flow through pretty much down to margin. But I don't have exact percentages that I could share with you between these various variants that we've seen.
Frank Morgan: Okay. Emma, I think that's about it now.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session.
Frank Morgan: All right. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Chris. Good morning, and welcome to everybody on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford, along with our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Michael Cuffe, and Frank Morgan, our new VP of IR. Welcome, Frank.
Frank Morgan: Pleasure here.
Mark Kimbrough: Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we'll take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam and Bill, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: All right. Thank you, Mark. And good morning, and thank you for joining us. As we begin this call, I want to reflect on 2021. Across many dimensions of our business, our teams demonstrated an impressive ability to adjust quickly and effectively to three different surges and deliver for our patients, deliver for our communities and deliver for each other. This steadfast resolve and sacrifice to serve others are what make health care workers special people in general, but specifically for HCA Healthcare, they are what make our company great. I want to thank our colleagues and physicians for their outstanding work this past year. In the fourth quarter, the COVID pandemic once again altered course with the Omicron variant. As the Delta variant surge was slowing down at the end of the third quarter with some spill-over into the fourth, the Omicron surge started to influence our business in early December. Overall, our teams continued their tremendous response and the effects of the pandemic's ever changing conditions were managed well as reflected in our financial results for the fourth quarter, which were solid and in line with our most recent guidance. In the quarter, our hospitals provided care to 27,000 COVID-19 patients, approximately 5% of total admissions. This level is significantly below the third quarter's 13%. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have provided inpatient care to over 260,000 patients who contracted the virus. Currently, our hospitals continue to treat many patients with COVID-19. COVID-related census levels fortunately have begun to peak, and we anticipate they will decline over the next few weeks. Same-facility revenues grew 6.4% in the quarter as compared to prior year. Inpatient revenue grew 2% and outpatient revenue grew 13%. Same-facility volumes increased on a year-over-year basis across most major categories, with the exception of inpatient surgeries, which were down 1%. In a challenging labor market, our teams adjusted well. Labor costs created some pressure on margins as compared to last year. But sequentially, there was no significant change in this metric as compared to the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was strong. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales of facilities, increased 7% to $4.42 in the quarter. As we move into 2022, our overall outlook for the year remains generally consistent with the early perspectives we provided in last quarter's call. While certain aspects of our business, including the impact of the pandemic remain difficult to predict, we believe the guidance that we are providing today is reasonable. We also believe that the combination of our disciplined operating culture, plus our growth plan and the strong support from our capital deployment program, should help us deliver the results we are forecasting for the year and enhance long-term shareholder value. As I indicated previously, we believe demand for health care services will be strong in 2022 and comparable to historical growth rates in the 2% to 3% zone with COVID-related admissions representing between 3% and 5% of total. We expect this demand to be supported by a growing economy and more insurance coverage for people through their employer or the exchanges. We believe HCA Healthcare's strong and diversified portfolio of markets is differentiated across the industry and presents numerous long-term growth opportunities. Because of this, we plan to continue investing in our core strategy of developing our provider networks through our capital spending plan and also through acquisitions when available [Technical Difficulty] core acquisition that we completed at the end of the year in South Florida. These investments continue to add depth to our networks and convenience for our patients, creating an easier and more cost-effective accessibility for our health care systems. Over the past year, we have increased the ambulatory care sites in our networks by 14%, bringing the total number to approximately 2,200. These sites support the 182 hospitals we operate today and will provide support in the future to the eight new hospitals we recently announced in various Texas and Florida markets. As I mentioned, we are operating in a difficult labor market. Over the past year, we have invested in our colleagues with increased pay, supplemental bonus programs and additional benefits. These investments, coupled with our efforts to improve operational support for providing care, should help us mitigate some of the difficulties caused by this environment. These past two years certainly have been a strain on our people. But through it all, they have demonstrated a level of excellence, compassion and resilience that has strengthened the company in many ways. They have accomplished this while simultaneously staying true to our mission and better positioning us for continued success. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for more details on the quarter's results, our '22 earnings guidance and capital deployment plan. Thank you.
Bill Rutherford: Okay, great. Thank you, Sam. And good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the year, then discuss our 2022 guidance. Our cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion as compared to a use of cash of $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the prior year quarter, cash flow was affected by our returning or repaying early approximately $6 billion of Cares Act funding. For full year 2021, cash flow from operations was just under $9 billion. Capital spending was $1.2 billion for the quarter and was $3.6 billion for the full year 2021. In addition, we have approximately $4.1 billion of approved capital in the pipeline that is scheduled to come online over the next three years. We completed just over $2 billion of share repurchases during the quarter and $8.2 billion for the full year. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times at the end of the third quarter, and we had approximately $3.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. For full year 2021, we realized approximately $2.2 billion in proceeds from sales of facilities and health care entities and recognized approximately $1.6 billion in gains on these sales. We also executed on $1.1 billion of acquisitions on health care entities during the year. As noted in our release this morning, we are providing full year 2022 guidance as follows, we expect revenue to range between $60 billion and $62 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $5.55 billion and $5.835 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.55 billion and $13.05 billion. We expect full year diluted EPS to range between $18.40 and $19.20. And we expect capital spending to approximate $4.2 billion during the year. So let me provide some additional commentary on our guidance. The mid-point of our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $12.8 billion reflects a 1.2% increase over our 2021 adjusted EBITDA. In 2021, we recognized approximately $900 million in COVID support from the DRG add-on's HRSA reimbursement for uninsured COVID patients and the impact of the delay in sequestration cuts. We do not have full line of sight into all of these programs for the full year, but we do expect some benefit continuing, and our guidance anticipates approximately $150 million of support in 2022. In addition, our divestitures contributed about $140 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2021. When you consider these items, along with an estimate of about $300 million of incremental cost for serving COVID patients in 2021, our growth in adjusted EBITDA is consistent with our historical expectations for growth over time of 4% to 6%. Within guidance, we expect our same-facility admissions to grow approximately 2% to 3%, while revenue per admission to grow approximately 1%. We anticipate outpatient revenue to grow in the mid to high single digits. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA margin to range between 20% and 21% for the full year. Depreciation is estimated to be about $3 billion and interest expense is projected to be around $1.7 billion. Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be about 303 million for the full year. Cash flow from operations is estimated to range between $9 billion and $9.5 billion. As also noted in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $8 billion share repurchase program and declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.48 to $0.56 per share. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to open it up for Q&A.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Bill. Thank you, Sam. Chris, would you provide instructions on the queue for questions? And remind everyone to limit their questions to one, please, so that we can get as many people on this call as faster.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Ann Hynes: Hi, great. Good morning.
Sam Hazen: Hey, Ann.
Ann Hynes: Just a couple of – how are you? Just a couple of questions. So when I look at inpatient and outpatient versus 2009 [ph] they're down roughly 5%, which is a deterioration from prior quarters. Can you tell us what's driving that? Is it - I mean, obviously, it's staffing issues. So maybe what's driving the staffing issues versus COVID spikes and you are turning people away versus maybe a change in patient behavior? And then a quick clarification on your 2022 guidance, I think you said for 2021, you had about $300 million of incremental costs for COVID. Can you tell us what that is embedded in guidance for 2022? That would be great. Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Yeah. Ann, you were breaking up a little bit on your first question. The second, I think we all understood. The first, did anyone get that? Can you repeat that, Ann, please?
Ann Hynes: Sure. So when I look at inpatient and outpatient trends in Q4 versus Q4 2019, they were down roughly by 5%, which is a slight deterioration from prior quarters. So can we just get some more color what's driving that? I mean, I know there's staffing issues. Are you not able to admit patients because of staffing issues? Or is it you're turning patients away because of COVID spikes or is it maybe a change in patient behavior? So if you can provide some color on that versus 2019?
Sam Hazen: I think a couple of high level observations that we believe are indicative of the fourth quarter of 2021 versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Obviously, we were carrying over into the fourth quarter a little bit of the Delta variant, and that was influencing some activity in some markets and we think that had some impact on the 2019 comparison. The second item would be that overall, we didn't see the same seasonality bump that we typically see in the fourth quarter. Again, we think that was influenced by the two different surges that were ramping down and ramping up. And then the third observation would be then on our inpatient activity. We have seen some migration in inpatient orthopedic surgeries primarily. And outpatient and that did influence the inpatient stat and propped up the outpatient stat somewhat with respect to surgeries. So those will be the three main drivers, I think, of the comparisons. All in all, we did have to manage some capacity in certain situations, again, of the COVID markets. And we're hopeful, again, as we wind down the Omicron variant, that we can get back to some normal period of business. Again, in the 2021, as I've said on our third quarter call, we really haven't had a normal run of what our business trends would be. We've had a holiday variant at the end of 2020 carried into 2021. We had the Delta variant in the middle. We had maybe three to four months where we can - there was no COVID influence of any significance. So we're making some judgments around those variations, but that would be the three level observations we have on the 2019 comparisons.
Bill Rutherford: Yeah. And 1Ann, this is Bill. On your second question regarding the $300 million of incremental costs, that would be above and beyond what we're anticipating next year. You know, we want to highlight the fact that we are seeing some decline in COVID support and acknowledge that we'd also expect to see some decline of some of that direct incremental costs. So that is above and beyond what we would expect.
Mark Kimbrough: And that could include drug-related PP&E and other related costs associated with treatment of COVID patients.
Ann Hynes: Great. And congratulations on your retirement, Mark.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Ann. Appreciate it.
Sam Hazen: Chris?
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. Yeah, it seems like HCA feels a little bit more controversial today than I'm used to it being, predominantly around where the margin should be normalizing out to. Obviously, this year, you're looking for lower margins than last year, but it's still nicely up from where 2019 was. Can you just level set for us where do you think ultimately those margins normalize into 2023 and beyond? And to the extent that it's above you know, the 19.5% in 2019, can you help us bridge what has gotten better sustainably from where you were pre=COVID? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Thanks, Kevin. Yeah, Kevin, this is Bill. I'll make a shot at that. So as you heard in our commentary, we expect margins to land between 20% and 21%. Obviously, as we know, we've talked about during this COVID period of time, when you compare it to pre COVID, we've seen a growth in acuity, as we've seen people return to have higher intensity of services. And we've lost a little bit of the lower acuity business during this period of time. And we've enjoyed a favorable payer mix as we – you know, a full employment effort, the activity in the health insurance exchanges. And so we saw obviously significant growth over the past, call it, six quarters since the middle of 2020. We expect those trends to remain positive, but maybe not at the same level. And that's helping drive some of the margins that we're seeing currently. And I think our view is that, you know, that coupled with other efforts, HCA had - that we should be able to land within the ranges we provided.
Kevin Fischbeck: Is that the right long-term amount as well?
Sam Hazen: Well, based on what we know today, there's no reason to presume we can't stay somewhere in that range. But obviously, there is a lot of variables to our business, and we'll have to advance our perspectives on those when we get those variables, I'll say, better understood over the course of this next year and so forth. But that's our thing. We've had a number, Kevin, financial resiliency initiatives, and we have ongoing initiatives that we think are positive to margin, all things equal. But we'll have to wait and see how some of these other components of our business develop over the course of 2022.
Kevin Fischbeck: All right, great. Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Kevin. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Mok with UBS Technology. Your line is open.
Andrew Mok: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to echo congratulations to Mark on your retirement. On the 2022 guide, I want to make sure I understand the progression and development of the guide since the 3Q earnings call. Are you saying that since 3Q, you're now expecting more COVID patients and because government relief only gives us line of sight through April, you're planning for a significantly higher level of COVID costs in 2022? But only one quarter of extended government relief, such that there's somewhat of a mismatch in COVID cost and COVID relief in 2022?
Bill Rutherford: Thank you, Andrew. Yeah. I mean, I think our guidance is very consistent with what our third quarter commentary is. I mean, there's obviously a lot of moving parts. I think the COVID volume we're anticipating now, as Sam mentioned, between 3% to 5% is consistent with where we thought COVID volume would be when we provided our third quarter. The COVID support programs that we mentioned, I think, are pretty close to what we anticipated during that discussion. So you know, without talking about the progression of those occurring during the year, I think overall, our guidance is very consistent with what our commentary and what our beliefs were at the end of the third quarter.
Andrew Mok: Got it. Okay.
Bill Rutherford: Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Obviously, first, Mark, thanks for everything over 20 years. Enjoy your retirement, you'll be missed. Then from a question perspective, maybe you can talk a little bit about two things, right? So one, your - you - we think you got some dollars, at least - there are some articles out there that you might have got about $250 million from Florida in terms of extra Medicaid payments. Can you talk a little bit about that? Was it recognized in the fourth quarter? Is it in the guidance for 2022 or because you - maybe you haven't gotten it yet so you didn't recognize it yet. So that's number one. And then number two, just in terms of your pricing assumption in terms of revenue per admit. Is it fair to say then that the - versus the typical 2% to 3% you're saying, one, you're assuming maybe about 1% of that is kind of a headwind from government dollars that are going to be down materially. And then the other 1% is a little bit of – you know, the extra 1% maybe a little bit of payer mix deterioration? Is that a reasonable way to think about it?
Bill Rutherford: All right, Justin. Yeah. So let me try to address that. So let me talk about Florida and the other supplemental programs that we have in the quarter. And I know there's been a lot of discussion. We are participating in the Florida DPP program. And in the fourth quarter, we did recognize a net benefit of approximately $130 million related to that program, we do expect to recognize a similar benefit in the latter half in 2022 as well. But I also want to talk about Texas for a moment. I think it's been reported that CMS has not yet approved the Medicaid directed payment program in Texas that's to go into effect September 1st, of '21. And as a result of this new program not being approved, we did not record any revenue anticipated with this aspect of the waiver program in the latter four months of the year. So this equated to about $120 million reduction in our waiver revenue in the fourth quarter compared to what we had recognized in the three previous quarters. So it largely offset the impact of the Florida program in our consolidated results. We believe eventually, the Texas program will be worked out, and we don't anticipate it being a headwind for 2022. But our full year guidance anticipates that we'll be able to recognize that annual historical level over time, even though it may take some time for the state of Texas and CMS to work that through. On the pricing side, our revenue per admit at 1%, you're right, it's a little lower than maybe historically on there. When you adjust for the COVID, it does add about point so I think that's right. And then when you think our outpatient revenue growth, as I mentioned, we expect to be in the mid to high single digits, and you blend that, I think it would look relatively consistent when you look at revenue per equivalent admission. So we think it's generally in the range of what our historical trends would indicate.
Justin Lake: Okay. Can I just ask a quick follow-up, Bill, on the Texas and Florida? So the way to think about them for 2022 is you're building in this extra, and let's say, $130 million for Florida is in the '22 guidance. And then theoretically, you would also have a catch-up, right, from the fourth quarter of those last four months where there's an extra $130 million. So there's another $200 million and, let's say, $50 million of kind of extra dollars that are either at a period or probably may or may not continue from Florida and Texas in 2022? Is that the right way to think about it?
Bill Rutherford: Well, just I think in our guidance, we're anticipating an annual amount, a 12 month in our guidance, we're not anticipating the catch-up, just given the uncertainty of how that may settle out. So we're going to have to wait to see how that is developed. The state of Texas is testing that federal program. We're hoping that we get some understanding of that soon. So our guidance really reflects an annual amount, not necessarily a catch-up amount from this year. And so we'll just have to see how that plays out.
Justin Lake: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Bill Rutherford: Thank you, Justin. Operator Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
A.J. Rice: Thanks, everybody. And best wishes, Mark. I will say how long we've interacting. But maybe I'll pivot and ask about, you guys have talked about from time to time in the COVID crisis, there you know, some of the downstream ability to discharge has been challenging home health, SNFs whatever. And you've also talked about that making - maybe having some impact on your capital deployment priorities. Can you just give us your updated thoughts as you see Delta moderate, Omicron come surge. Are you seeing issues with being able to discharge patients in the time frame you'd want? And any updated thoughts on having any of those areas, as particular, new or increased capital priorities?
Sam Hazen: Thank you, A.J. One of the areas that we're focused on and it's connected really to our labor agenda and it's connected to our overall business agenda for 2022 is managing capacity and throughput most effectively. So case management linked to state management, discharge planning to post-acute in other settings is very important to our success, ER throughput. All of those elements are very important to our ability to manage capacity. And then clearly, we have to execute on our labor agenda, and we have a robust labor agenda to respond to the issues that we face on the people side of our equation. And as it relates to the surges, discharge planning during the surges has been a little bit more difficult. It's been more difficult in the Omicron variant because the nursing home environment and even the home care environment has been suffering from employees who have been infected by the Omicron variant. And so that's created a little bit of a contraction, we think, in some markets with overall post-acute capacity. And that has delayed our ability to execute on our discharge planning process as we ordinarily would. As it pertains, A.J., to our capital planning, as you know, we did acquire the home care and hospice business unit from Brookdale. We have been in the process of integrating that business into our company. And the first part of this year has been about integration. We sold non-overlap components to another home care company, and then we've been organizing ourselves around home care and hospitals inside of the markets where we overlap. And so again, we're in the early stages of integration. We're looking for some significant strides on that front in '22. Additionally, we're making significant investments in rehab, as we've mentioned on these calls in the past, particularly in Florida but also in other components of our business. And we think that will enhance our ability to manage the post-acute discharge process a little bit more efficiently. We also have preferred networks that we've evolved with our bundled payment programs over the years with certain providers in post-acute. We will continue to leverage and build on those relationships, allowing us hopefully to maintain efficient discharge planning process. The last thing I would say on that front as well is our case management program is continuing to be advanced in our company. We are implementing technology. We are deploying certain shared services capabilities around utilization review and so forth. And we think those initiatives are going to yield benefits for us as it relates to capacity management. So a lot of components to this, A.J., overall capital spending, however, to sum it all up here materially changing from what we previously indicated.
A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Pito Chickering: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to echo everyone's comments, Mark, a big thank you. It's been a pleasure working with you over the years. And Frank, I look forward to working with you again in the future. So guys, I'm asking a single sort of multipart question here. So labor is obviously a big topic these days. So the first question is, how should we model the cadence of earnings in 2022 versus the pre-COVID year? Number two, on 3.8% [ph] of revenue growth guidance, you're only guiding to 50 basis points of margin compression despite these labor pressures. Can you give us any color on where salvage benefits tracks in '22 versus '21? Any other color on supply in OpEx? And then finally, number three, what assumptions are you making on labor costs sort of throughout the year? Do you have a moderating stagnant levels? Any color you can give us there?
Bill Rutherford: Thank you. Pito, this Bill. Let me start with the quarterly case. Obviously, we don't give specific guidance. But I think when you consider the discussion I had around the Texas waiver program, and we think that will take some time to settle out potentially even into the second half of the year. And then we think about labor, you know, where the current trends probably more pressured in the first half of the year, we think we can continue to manage through those in the second half of the year. I think it's reasonable to expect that our growth will be weighted in the second half of the year. We expect that as we've seen the utilization of some of our premium labor, especially around contract labor, that we can ease that as we go through the balance of the year as, hopefully, we get out of a COVID surge environment. And that will provide some relief as we progress through the second half of 2022. On supplies and OpEx, our assumptions are really consistent with our trends. When I look at those two areas as a percentage of revenue, they stay pretty close in terms of the variability from period to period. So there is really no major tailwinds or headwinds that I would call out on those. I think our supply trends and our other operating trends would be consistent with, I think, what we've seen throughout most of this year.
Pito Chickering: Okay, great. And actually, a follow-up question on the premium labor. Can you quantify how much premium labor you guys saw in the fourth quarter and what you're assuming in 2022? Thanks so much.
Bill Rutherford: Well, I think it's - we did obviously have to utilize higher contract labor. I think the impact was as much about the cost to procure contract labor as it was the utilization. Our contract labor FTEs were up maybe 10% compared to where we ran in the first quarter. But the cost to procure that contract labor update was up significantly. So we believe that as the COVID surges begin to dissipate, that the cost per contract labor will be able to manage through that and manage that down. So those are basically the numbers right now.
Pito Chickering: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Whit Mayo with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.
Whit Mayo: Hey, Thanks. Best wishes, Mark. Bill, my question is when I look at the framework that you've offered up for 2022, I may be off a point or so here. But if COVID is budgeted to be 3% to 5% of your total admissions, it does seem to imply that non-COVID admissions grow maybe somewhere in the high single-digit range, but that could be roughly flat versus 2019. So I'm just trying to see if you can put into context that the growth in non-COVID and how that's been trending. And maybe any color around service lines just to help us bridge that increase. And any views on maybe the first quarter could be helpful? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: All right. Thank you, Whit. If you look at COVID in discrete terms, you're probably not incorrect with some of your estimations. But I don't think we're viewing COVID completely discrete in the sense that some of those patients would still be entering the system regardless of COVID, and that was especially true in the fourth quarter as we looked at some of our COVID patients and such that they were coming in for different reasons. And then they were also COVID positive because many people didn't even know they had COVID. So I think you have to sort of look at it as a bit of a mixed bag there and that's how we're judging it as well. I do believe that there was deferred demand, and it still showed itself in the quarter and will yield some recovery in the first part of 2022. I mean, literally, we had surgeons who were closing practices, canceling cases because they themselves contracted the Omicron variant. So I think from that standpoint, there is the typical COVID impact on volumes in the quarter while we're experiencing a surge. But we believe, again, you know, that strong job growth across our portfolio of markets, more people covered by the exchange, deferrals, some elective and transfer closures across our portfolio all bode well for our ability to recover volume in 2022. Again, as I mentioned to A.J., we have to manage capacity. We have to supply that capacity with labor, and we're working through all of those elements as we speak to put ourselves in the best position to receive that demand. We're very excited about the prospects for growth across the company, as I mentioned in my comments. We're investing in that. We've announced, as I mentioned, eight new hospitals, recognized some of the overall growth that exists in these markets. We've had momentum. If you look at our market share at the end of 2019, it was north of 26.5%. It ended with the most recent data that we which is about 1.5 years later, right under 28% so we gained share during COVID. We've positioned our organization, we believe, with our ambulatory network better. And when we bump that up to what we're judging to be some demand that's been dislocated by the COVID surges, we feel like our guidance is reasonable.
Whit Mayo: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Sam Hazen: All right. Thanks, Whit. Operator Your next question is from Sarah James with Barclays. Your line is open.
Sarah James: Thank you. And I echo the heartfelt comments to Mark.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you.
Sarah James: Much of the wage inflation environment do you think of as a structural shift or a shift in how we think about the base wage range for nurses? And how does that impact your conversations with payers and how you think about CapEx or capital deployment mix?
Sam Hazen: Thank you, Sarah. Well, as Bill mentioned, the market has been significantly disrupted, the labor market that it has been significantly disrupted with COVID. What we see during COVID surges is more opportunities for our nurses and other people's nurses to go into a traveler and get a really outsized rate. We think as COVID surges moderate, that is going to moderate the overall market to some degree. We have advanced our wages for our employees. We've advanced some of our benefits. We've provided certain shift bonuses throughout the year, and that has yielded some increased rate of wage growth for our employee base. We think, however, moving into 2022 as we go through the moderation on the contract labor, we'll be able to absorb the wage trends that are built into our employee base over the course of '22 and land somewhere around 3% to 3.5% possibly on a composite basis for our cost per FTE. And that, we believe, is a something that we can absorb in our guidance. As it relates to our payer contracts, yes, we are talking to them about inflationary pressures and how that will influence future contracting. At this particular point in time, our book-of-business for 2022 is pretty much accomplished and part of '23 is accomplished. But we're building in some flexibility to reflect the inflationary pressures that might exist and we'll continue to work through those as we work through our contract portfolio with the different payers. But I think in general, they understand the pressures that providers are facing on that front, and they have the unique ability to adjust their premiums on an annual basis in most instances. And that should line-up with the need for us to get a fair cost increase related to inflation.
Mark Kimbrough: All right, Sarah, thanks.
Sarah James: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. And will echo the thanks to Mark and best wishes to Frank. Had a question was interested to get a few more details on the eight hospitals that you're – that you've announced that you're going to plan to build an aggregate in Florida and in Texas. And just specifically interested if you could talk about what the overall related CapEx would be for those facilities and the ROIC that you think you can generate on them. And then also maybe an aggregate sort of new beds that you'll think that you'll be able to add from those eighty facilities and when, in terms of timing, those are expected to come online? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: All right, Scott. Thanks. Well, I would submit that the eight projects that we've announced is not going to materially change our capital thinking over the next two to three years. We believe we can absorb most of that in what will be a budget that's approximately what we're indicating for, for this year. The situation is this. I mean, some of these markets are growing significantly often. This, as everybody probably knows, is growing in a way that is creating opportunities for us, just like it's creating opportunities for others in that community. But with the growth in that market and with the occupancy that we currently run in Austin, Texas, as an example, it presents a nice platform for us to expand into some of these growing areas and add to our network. Most of these hospitals will be primary and secondary care type hospitals with basic inpatient services and many outpatient services. And then to the extent that these patients need deeper, more acute care, we obviously have those capabilities in or different markets. We have the same situation in Florida with the exception of one hospital that we're building in Fort Myers, which is a new market for us. And we're extending into that market because there's a need for more capacity and it's proximal to one of our west markets in a way that we think we can create synergies. So I think with respect to returns, we have a pattern, we believe of producing very solid projects. It's reflected in our return on capital overall. And we anticipate that these projects over time will yield the same kind of value that we've typically generate with capital programs. So that's where we are with them. Again, most of them are going to be 50 to 75 beds starting out. They're not huge hospitals. They're complementary assets that, over time, will hopefully grow to more acute and more capable facilities with respect to service offerings.
Scott Fidel: All right. Thanks, Sam.
Operator: Our next question is from Gary Taylor with Cowen. Your line is open.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Mark, congrats. Not to make you feel old, but I think HCA had $2 billion of revenue in 1982 when you started so you've come a long way.
Mark Kimbrough: That's right. I remember. Thank you.
Gary Taylor: One clarification and one question. I just want to clarify, the Utah hospital's not yet in the guide. And then my question just going back to labor, I know you've covered a lot on it, I appreciate it. But Bill, on the 3Q, you had talked about contract labor over time, shift differentials and you had said 10% to 12% of FTEs were in those premium categories. And I think you - I think all three of those were included in sort of the premium categories. So I just wanted to get a sense sequentially if you have that figure, if there's a sense that, that eased at all yet or we're still waiting to see that.
Bill Rutherford: This is Bill. To answer, yes, Utah is not in our guidance. So we're still in a regulatory review process, so we've not included any of that in our guidance. Regarding the contract labor and premium labor trends, we did see some improvement as we went through the fourth quarter. I think the number is closer to 11% of our nursing hours were contract hours in the fourth quarter. So there is some slight improvement going forward. And as we think about in my earlier commentary, we think in the first half of '22, we'll continue to see that pressure over time as the year goes on, as hopefully dissipates, we'll be able to manage that process down.
Gary Taylor: Thank you.
Sam Hazen: All right. Thanks, Gary.
Operator: Our next question is from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jamie Perse: Hey. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask one clarification first. On the COVID DRG and HRSA sequestration for 2021, if you can give a breakdown of that $900 million, and same thing for 2022, the $150 million that you're planning for? And then my real question is just around, I think, it was getting to this question, but the implied non-COVID volume in 2022. You're certainly not implying you get back to trend line maybe back to 2019 levels. But really what is the bottleneck to get back to trend line growth? Is it discharge capacity, labor capacity? What are those bottlenecks that you would have to work through to see upside for your non-COVID volumes?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Let me take the first part of that, the breakdown of the COVID support. It was roughly $180 million from the DRG add-ons. The sequestration delay was about $200 million for us in '21. And then we had a little over million of HRSA reimbursement and then a little bit of technology add-on payments after that. Regarding '22, we know we have some visibility into the sequestration being phased in. I would say it's roughly half of the $150 million we talked about and the rest being from the other programs.
Sam Hazen: I think on the capacity side of the equation, again, if you categorize how we're approaching making sure we have adequate capacity, we have to execute on these categories in order to achieve that. First is staffing. We have to retain the staff we have. We have to recruit new staff, and we have to manage that obviously effectively. And again, we have a number of initiatives in place to deal with that and I'm encouraged by our hiring. We've advanced our recruiting agenda. We've got improvements in certain categories with turnover, and again, getting through COVID surges will be helpful to that. The second thing we're working on is something we're calling new models of care. We're exploring and experimenting with different approaches to staffing models that allow our nurses to be supported by different approaches and creating more capacity, if you will, for our nurse population in a way that delivers the patient outcomes we want and recognize that some of the market issues. And then the final piece is what I had mentioned previously around throughput and capacity management. And again, case management is a piece of that. Telemedicine inside of our hospitals is a piece of that. Load balancing across all of our bed capacity market is a piece of that. So we have a lot of elements of technology also factors into that and how we're using some new technology solutions to help us in throughput management. So those are the areas that we're focused on. And I've got confidence in our teams and our ability to execute around these categories and deliver the capacity that we're going to need in order to take care of the demand that's going to be in the communities.
Jamie Perse: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jason Cassorla with Citi. Your line is open.
Jason Cassorla: Thanks for taking my question. I guess just on the payer mix side, can you help flush out the volume growth in the quarter by payer cohort and how you're thinking about 2022 in context of that 2% to 3% overall volume growth embedded in guidance? I guess you suggest stability in payer mix for '22, but just wondering how you're thinking about the impact of any potential Medicaid re-verification activity and especially the pickup in the marketplace enrollment in your bigger states, I think, particularly in Texas. So any help there would be great. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yeah. I mean, in the quarter, we saw a continued favorable payer mix. Our managed care book for the quarter was up about 2.6% compared to our overall admissions that became favorable. That was partly driven, if not mostly driven by the health insurance exchange volume, we continue to see that we've talked about good enrollment and going into that. As we go forward into '22, as I mentioned in my comments, I think we're expecting that our acuity and payer mix should continue to be positive trends, maybe not at the same pace we've seen over this past several quarters but we expect some continued positive growth on that. Relative to the Medicaid piece, we've seen some pluses and minuses of Medicaid. Medicaid growth is up a little higher than our average. In terms of expectations for next year, I think they would be mostly consistent with what our recent trends have been. I'm not so sure what else was tagged in on his question.
Jason Cassorla: All right. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey. Good morning, guys. And Mark, thanks again for all the help over the years. I guess Sam my question, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how you saw the migration of inpatient ortho to outpatients. So just wondering how you're thinking about strategizing around that and how that plays out going forward. And maybe any color you can share on the difference in economics, maybe on an EBITDA basis, apples-to-apples for procedures inpatient versus outpatient on ortho?
Sam Hazen: So our total orthopedic volume, surgical volumes were up when you look at inpatient and outpatient in total. We have a physician alignment strategy with our orthopedic community that we think is yielding value. We continue to iterate on that to respond to some of the individual needs from one market to the other. The second piece of our strategy is around our outpatient elements and how we manage our surgical space in the hospitals for outpatient cases, and then also in our ambulatory surgery centers where we have orthopedic partners. So we have a multi-pronged approach to orthopedics, just like we do with most service lines, and it involves our quality agenda, our service agenda, our facility agenda and then our physicians. And so we have the same dynamic with orthopedics. The reimbursement per case is obviously less in an outpatient environment than it is in an inpatient. But I think the important thing about HCA Healthcare is we have such a diversification of services. And no one service provides a disproportionate amount of revenue or profits for the company. So when there's migration from one setting to the other, it doesn't necessarily change the overall equation for the company. And that's what we're seeing with orthopedics today. It's migrating. We've had other service lines over the years migrate from inpatient to outpatient. And we've been able to manage through that and actually create market share momentum around that transition, and we're believing that we have the right approach here with orthopedics as well.
Brian Tanquilut: Okay.
Operator: Our next question is from Kelvin Sternick [ph] with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to circle back to some of the Medicaid comments you made, specifically related to re-determinations. Just want to understand what's assumed in your guys guidance with respect to the resumption of Medicaid re-determinations and whether or not you think that has a discernible impact on your numbers, particularly in the back half? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Clear when you say re-determinations, we talked about the supplemental programs.
Mark Kimbrough: Rate determinations.
Bill Rutherford: Around eligibility. Yeah. I don't think there's any material assumptions in terms of changes of that into our expectations going forward. We haven't heard any discussion of that impact in our Medicaid volume projections going forward. So I would tell you that I think for next year, it's built on our historical trends remaining pretty consistent.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. Thanks, Kevin.
Kevin Fischbeck: All right. Chris, we got time for two questions, please.
Operator: Okay. Our next question is from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Joshua Raskin: Great. Thanks for taking me in. And congrats, Mark, and welcome Frank as well. On the labor front, I'm curious if you're seeing competition for clinical labor, specifically physicians, nurses, et cetera, that's mostly coming from other hospitals competing hospitals or maybe staffing situations. Or are there trends where individuals, the clinical labor is going to other areas, other sites or maybe even leaving health care because we continue to see that in media reports. And then maybe just a comment on Galen and the impact that, that's having and how that may be a competitive advantage for HCA?
Sam Hazen: Well, I think all of the above on labor. I mean, there's clearly competition for labor, not just in clinical labor, but non-clinical labor, too. The service side of our agenda, we have competitive dynamics on that labor front as well. So we're no different than any other industry when it comes to that. I think, again, we have advanced our recruitment very significantly, and we're recruiting significant numbers of nurses. We have retention efforts that I think are going to pay off. The care transformation that I mentioned in capacity management, all that's connected to a staffing solution for our company. And we're competing very aggressive in this space, just like we compete for physicians, just like we compete for patients and so forth. So I'm confident in our competitive abilities on this particular agenda. Galen is off to a great start. We acquired it, and we're limited to when we could start our expansions. We started our expansion this past year. I think we have 12 new schools in the pipeline, maybe six or eight of them have actually opened, one in Austin and one in Nashville. We're both the fastest ramp-up in new enrollment history of Galen, their CEO told me. So we're very excited about the prospects. It will take us time to graduate these nurses, but we expect to have 12 to 18 new schools over the next two to three years, and that should yield a number of new students for us. We will integrate those students into our facilities in ways that hopefully secure an employment opportunity for them in an HCA facility when they graduate. We anticipate tripling the number of graduates over what they currently produce by 2026, which yield a reasonable growth in number of nurses in the communities that, again, hopefully, we can retain into our facilities. We believe our faculty will be supported by HCA nursing leadership, and the externs programs that we'll use for students in the Galen school will be integrated into HCA procedures, systems and so forth. And we do think that creates some advantage in securing these graduates into our facilities.
Joshua Raskin: All right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our final question is from Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Ben Hendrix: Hey, thanks, guys for squeezing me in at the end. And congratulations to both Mark and Frank. I think most of my questions have been answered, and you've touched on this. But just kind of get your inpatient care delivery efforts and then length of stay management, this is all a consistent theme we've heard from your competitors. Certainly, Tenet has talked about this and Community as well. But just wanted to get a little bit more color on what you think are your key differentiators, whether that be your scale, your approach, and kind of what might give HCA the competitive advantage in that endeavour? And then a follow-on to that, kind of what inning are we in? How much room to run do we have on getting efficiency out of - specifically the care delivery?
Sam Hazen: All right. Thanks, Ben. I don't know what the other companies are necessarily saying about this particular agenda. I think what we're trying to do is make sure we're using technology. We have training and visibility into the processes that make a difference in case management. And then we're ultimately using our capacity broadly across the markets to support better throughput and overall capacity management. And then, as I mentioned, we've advanced our capabilities in post-acute with our own acquisitions and development, as well as relationships with others. And I think the combination of all of those elements create an opportunity for us to gain more efficiencies through our case management programs overall. And we think also that will help us with our receivables and our management of denials and so forth with the payers, and there is some yield on that front as well. So we're pretty excited about the developments in this area. How much more advantage we are than others, I can't really speak to that.
Ben Hendrix: All right.
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn the call over to Mr. Hazen for any closing remarks.
Sam Hazen: Yeah. Well, thank you again for participating on our call, and I wanted to take this moment to thank Mark for his 39 years of service. He and I both have worked 39 years with the company. I'm not sure why he's retiring. But nonetheless, he has had a wonderful career and represented our company incredibly well with our shareholders and others, and I want to thank him for that. And again, welcome, Frank, to the team. Frank's going to do a wonderful job as well. So Mark, congratulations, and we wish you the best.
Mark Kimbrough: Well, I wanted to say thanks, too. And finishing up our - my final earnings call, I wanted to thank Sam and Bill and all the others I've known and worked alongside these past 39 plus years. I truly enjoyed working with everyone here at HCA and all of you listening on the call today, too. I also want to thank Dr. Frist for his vision in creating HCA and Vic Campbell for his years of mentoring and friendship to me over the past decades. Frank and I will be here to answer any further questions you might have following this call, so feel free to give us a shout this afternoon or the week. Thank you so much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Chris, thank you so much. Good morning, and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam and Bill, let me remind everyone that should today’s call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based upon management’s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today’s press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning’s call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare is included in today’s release. This morning’s call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Sam. Sam?
Sam Hazen: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The third quarter was the most intense period yet for us with the COVID pandemic. The Delta variant surged and drove significant demand for our services. For the quarter, COVID patients accounted for 13% of total admissions. This level compares to 3% in the second quarter, 10% in the first quarter and 11% in the fourth quarter of last year. Our teams provided record levels of inpatient care during the quarter, which drove revenue growth of 15% as compared to the prior year. Inpatient revenue grew 18% and outpatient revenue grew 11%. As compared to prior year and also 2019, same-facility volumes increased across all major categories, with the exception of inpatient surgery. Surgery volumes were constrained, because capacity was used for treating COVID patients. This growth was supported by a better payer mix of commercial business. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at over 21%. Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales of facilities, increased to $4.57, which is a notable increase over the prior year. Even considering that last year's third quarter included the $1.72 per share effect of the reversal of the government stimulus income, which as you may recall, resulted from our decision to return or repay early approximately $6 billion of governmental assistance we received from the CARES Act. Once again, our colleagues and physicians delivered for our patients and for our communities. I am tremendously proud of their dedication and service to others, and I want to thank them for their great work. As we look to the remainder of 2021, we have raised our annual earnings guidance again to reflect the strong performance of the company. Now let me transition to some early and general perspectives on the upcoming year. Just like in 2020, we are providing some preliminary thoughts in the midst of a very fluid environment, which obviously makes it challenging, given the uncertainties that continue to exist with the pandemic. We plan to provide more details with our annual guidance in January, after we complete our planning process for 2022. By that time, we hope to have a few more months of results that are more indicative of a normal operating environment that is a non-COVID surge environment to analyze and give you a better indication of our business. Overall, we believe demand will return to historical trends for us, with volumes growing across most categories in the 2% to 3% zone. As part of this growth, we expect to treat COVID patients throughout 2022. We estimate that approximately 3% to 5% of our total admissions will be COVID-related. We believe our business will be supported by a strong payer mix as a result of stable enrollment in the health insurance exchanges and good job growth across our markets. We are also assuming patient acuity continues at high levels. We do expect certain pandemic-related governmental reimbursement programs either will not continue or will continue but at significantly reduced amounts next year. However, we anticipate the reduction of these revenues will be partially offset by certain costs we incurred in treating COVID patients. Clearly, we are operating in a challenging labor environment, which we expect to cause some cost pressures. But at this point in time, we anticipate being able to manage through these challenges along with other inflationary cost pressures. In sum, these assumptions lead us to believe that adjusted EBITDA for 2022 will show modest growth over this year's estimated results. Again, we are providing early perspectives and expectations, and they could change. The past two years have been a remarkable period for HCA Healthcare. We have demonstrated a high level of resiliency and resolve, while at the same time, staying true to our mission. Across many dimensions of our business, we have improved. We have improved our operational and organizational capabilities, which should allow us to provide higher quality care to our patients. I also believe we will emerge on the backside of this event stronger financially and better positioned competitively to grow and drive value for our stakeholders. We are investing aggressively at our operating model, which is to develop a comprehensive and conveniently located local network, coupled with and supported by an enterprise-level system with unique scale and system-level capabilities. We believe this model creates competitive advantage, drives market share gains and produces better outcomes for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Thank you.
Bill Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will discuss our cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter then review our updated 2021 guidance. Our cash flow from operations was $2.28 billion as compared to $2.7 billion in the third quarter of 2020. In the prior year, we had received approximately $300 million of stimulus income and deferred approximately $200 million of payroll taxes. Capital spending for the quarter was $889 million. And we have approximately $3.9 billion of approved capital in the pipeline that is scheduled to come online between now and the end of 2023. We completed just over $2.3 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. We have approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our authorization, and we anticipate completing approximately $8 billion of share repurchases for full year 2021. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.55 times at the end of the third quarter, which is the lowest it has been in over 15 years. We had approximately $5.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. Also during the quarter, we recorded about $1 billion gain on sale of facilities related to the sale of four hospitals in Georgia and other healthcare entity investments. We anticipate, we will generate approximately $1.5 billion of after-tax proceeds from our announced divestitures. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2021 guidance as follows. We now expect revenues to range between $58.7 billion and $59.3 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.5 billion and $12.8 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $17.20 and $17.80. And our capital spending target remains at approximately $3.7 billion. As I conclude my remarks, I think it's important to reflect on the financial condition of the company, as we have navigated the past 20 months of this pandemic. The financial resiliency of HCA Healthcare has been on full display during this time. Our organization has emerged stronger today than before we entered this pandemic. With our leverage ratio well below the low end of our stated range of three times, our available liquidity and our continued strong cash flow generation, we are well positioned as we evaluate capital allocation opportunities heading into our planning cycle for 2022. We are focused and committed to delivering long-term value for all of our stakeholders. We look forward to sharing more information with you about our outlook in our year-end call.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to open it up for Q&A.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Sam. Thanks, Bill. Chris, would you give instructions on getting into the queue for questions, please?
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]
Mark Kimbrough: I’d like to remind everyone also to try to keep the questions to one, so that we can try to get as many people in the queue as possible.
Operator: Our first question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Sorry, I’m going to ask for a quick clarification and then the main question. Did you say that 2% to 3% volume growth in total or across most service lines? It sounds like COVID volume might actually be down next year. So I just want to make sure I was hearing that right. But then the main question is really about labor costs. It does seem like labor was higher than we thought this quarter. And then Q4 looks like the margins may be a little bit lower than we thought. Just a little more color on how you're managing labor and what kind of pressure you're seeing there today?
Sam Hazen: I couldn't hear what he said the first question was?
Bill Rutherford: The volume. 2% to 3% on the volume. Was that all-inclusive versus across service lines, certain service lines?
Kevin Fischbeck: Yes. Because COVID is down, right? So...
Bill Rutherford: Yes, we were saying volume…
Kevin Fischbeck: I wasn’t sure if you’re saying core business up COVID up 2% to 3% and COVID down?
Sam Hazen: We expect COVID volumes to be down. As I said, we are anticipating 3% to 5% of our total admissions will be COVID-related next year. It's about 9%, I think, for this year. So that we do expect some decline in COVID-related, and we hope that happens for our communities and so forth. And so when we estimate at this particular point in time, we're expecting composite volumes across the company as a whole to be up in the 2% to 3% zone over 2020 and over 2019 is really what it boils down to.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Labor?
Sam Hazen: Yes. On labor, let me speak to labor. Obviously, in the third quarter, we were dealing with a very intense COVID surge, with very sick patients. And it was putting a significant strain on our communities and on our facilities and so forth. And we did what we absolutely had to do as a moral imperative to take care of people. And that required us to support that volume and that level of acuity with labor and our labor cost did step up in the third quarter. We used premium pay where we needed to. We used different levels of shift bonuses and overtime where we needed to. But that was not a question to us. We had a lot of people to take care of, and we took care of them appropriately. And we still produced, I think, a very good outcome for the company, with margins at over 21% in the third quarter and actually producing record EBITDA levels. So, labor going forward, we have a multipronged strategy for managing. It starts with expanding our school of nursing, which we think is going to produce a great pipeline of graduate nurses for our company. We anticipate approximately three times the number of graduates coming out of the Galen School of Nursing over the next few years compared to what we do today. The second thing we're working on is recruitment and retention. And we've added tremendous amount of resources to our recruitment functions. We've advanced our benefits in many areas. And we're trying to create an environment where nurses can accomplish what they need to do with our patients and ultimately, have an environment where they can be tremendously successful and discharging their responsibilities to our patients, and at the same time, more productive in doing just nursing care as opposed to non-nursing care. The last thing we're working on that we're very excited about is care transformation. We think we have opportunities with technology and with new models of care and different levels of support that can change the paradigm and how we deliver care on our floors, in our hospitals. And we think the combination of all three of these things put us in a position where we can manage through the environment that we're facing right now. Obviously, there's some unknowns. We're going to have to work our way through those as they present themselves, But we're pretty confident that the company is in a reasonable position to manage through the labor environment.
Mark Kimbrough: Kevin, thank you. Chris, next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Ann Hynes: Hi, good morning.
Sam Hazen: Hey, Ann.
Ann Hynes: I just want to know how volume tracked by payer mix? Is commercial still outperforming Medicare and Medicaid? And what your expectations are for 2022 when it comes to payer mix? And just one follow-up on your comment about inpatient surgeries being down. If you look at the chart you provided in the press release, they were down 11.2% versus 2019. Do you think that's all COVID-related, or is there something else happening sequentially? Thanks. 
Sam Hazen: All right, Ann.
Bill Rutherford: Ann, let me start with the payer mix. Our payer mix, I think, as Sam alluded to in his comments, remains favorable with our managed care and others growing probably 12% to 14% over the prior year. Our Medicare showed growth, but not quite at that level. We were 2% to 3% on Medicare. On whether we look at 2019, very similar trends. So, we continue to expect favorable payer mix trends going forward.
Sam Hazen: And with respect to labor - or surgery in the third quarter, as I mentioned in my comments, we constrained surgery out of need for other patient care requirements. So, we used our surgical staff in many instances to support COVID patients across our facilities. Number one, we had to use physical space in our recovery rooms at times to take care of people. And so from that standpoint, we did reduce elective care during the quarter at many of our hospitals. And we reduced transfers in that typically result in surgeries of some sort in many instances. We do think that, that volume will recover as it's recovered in previous periods where we had to do the same thing, second quarter to first quarter, as an example. So we anticipate recovery in that. And so from that standpoint, we are working our way through reopening surgery capacity across the company in an appropriate fashion. And we really don't see any structural issues with our surgical activity across the company.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Ann.
Ann Hynes: Thanks.
Mark Kimbrough: Chris?
Operator: The next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, and congrats to you guys on the quarter. I guess my question, as it relates to the guidance, it's sort of unusual for you to see a sequential decline in EBITDA from Q3 to Q4, which is what's implied by the midpoint of the 2021 guidance. So just wondering if that's just conservatism. And then as I think about the 2022 commentary, 2% to 3% volume, how are you thinking just about margin trend with labor in the background? Should we expect flat margins to translate to kind of like a 2% to 3% EBITDA growth rate as well?
Sam Hazen: Yes. Brian, let me start with the fourth quarter guidance. We think our range provides some level of growth, and we recognize at the midpoint, then there's still a lot of variables at play. We'll continue to manage the company the best we can to continue to drive growth. We've had very few normal months to project from. But we - again, I think our range is appropriate at this level. It's roughly a $350 million raise at the midpoint compared to our previous guidance. So, again, I think it's appropriate from how we read it right now.
Mark Kimbrough: Margin. I think he asked also about the margins.
Sam Hazen: Well, there's going to be a lot of variables that play into margins for next year. As we conclude our planning, we'll talk to you further about those. But I think we have a history to continue to drive reasonable margins going forward, and that's our expectation to be able to continue to do that.
Operator: Our next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Justin Lake: Thanks. A couple of things here. Just wanted to clarify, when you - given that historically, the typical EBITDA growth of the company is in the mid-single digits, when you say modest, is it fair to take lower single-digits there kind of as a jump-off point for 2022? And then my question is on labor. Can you give us a little color on two things? One, any kind of help on the - maybe the dollar amount and the percentage kind of temporary labor, travel labor that you're kind of running? I know - given it’s such high cost, it would be great on the revenue side, or I should say the cost side as well. And then, can you walk us through kind of how your labor costs are run through the year in terms of maybe what percentage of your labor kind of gets repriced to get their increases quarterly, because I know it's not all just 1:1? Thanks.
Mark Kimbrough: You snuck three questions in - on one call but...
Bill Rutherford: Justin, this is Bill. Let me start with kind of 2022. We - our intention was to provide some broad commentary, not really ready to go into a lot of details. But as we've mentioned throughout the course of the year, we know we've received some COVID support from the DRG add-on payments, HRSA payments for uninsured, COBRA payments, as well as the delay of sequestration cuts. These programs, they contribute about $625 million year-to-date. They could reach close to $750 million, $800 million for the full year. We don't have full line of sight now on what to expect for these programs going forward. We hope to have some clear assessment of these as we complete the planning process. But for now, we're not really expecting those to continue to benefit going into 2022. However, we also have some COVID-related costs this year that we don't expect to continue going forward; supply-related costs, cost of screeners and alike. So our broad thinking now is we should reasonably expect to be able to generate our historical growth rate of 5% to 6% after netting out these amounts. And that is what the result -- will result in some modest growth year-over-year on an as-reported basis. So that was kind of our broad thinking right now. We'll firm that up as we go through our planning cycle. But that was the intention of our commentary to show that we still see some growth going forward in 2022.
Sam Hazen: And with respect to labor, again, we used whatever labor we could find to take care of record census that the company was experiencing with the Delta variant surge. So we used contract labor over time. Again, bonuses for our full-time staff, whatever it took to staff to the patient load that we had. And that resulted in about 10% to 12% of our FTEs being in those premium pay categories. That obviously trends down naturally as we have a less COVID census. We've had that pattern in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year. And we expect that pattern to continue.  As it relates to the wage rates and the changes that we have, they vary across the company. Generally speaking, they're in -- mostly in the second quarter and third quarter. So that's part of the natural trend that we see inside of our labor costs as we move through the course of the year. One thing, and Bill was alluding to this, typically, we have fourth quarter seasonality that generates more activity in the fourth quarter than we have in the third quarter. We don't have a baseline third quarter to judge seasonality right now, and that's part of the challenge that we've got. But I think the company has proven that it can manage in a surge very effectively and produce really solid margins. And then in a reboot, like we did in the second quarter, managed through that transition in a very effective way. So I fully anticipate that our teams will be able to navigate through the back part of the third quarter, into the fourth quarter and on into next year, and hopefully, a reboot mode in a way that ultimately produces success for the company.
Operator: The next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open.
Scott Fidel: Interested if you could talk a bit about what you're seeing in Medicaid volumes. And just been interesting too, it seems like Medicaid volumes have continued to trend relatively low in terms of the overall mix even though Medicaid enrollments are just up so much because of the suspension of the redetermination. So just interested in your perspective on what you're thinking around that aspect, in terms of the lower Medicaid vaults relative to the increases in Medicaid enrollment growth. Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Great. Thanks, Scott.
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Scott. I'll try. We did see Medicaid growth when I look at 2021 versus 2020 of almost 9%, I don't have at my fingertips what Medicaid enrollment has done in our states. So I don't have that as a relative base. But we have seen Medicaid growth in this quarter at least. Year-to-date, we're tracking at about 7%. So perhaps that does track with enrollment going forward as well.
Operator: The next question is from Ralph Giacobbe. Your line is open.
Ralph Giacobbe: I guess, first, you gave -- and I know you want to sort of hold off on full guidance. But you gave us the volume up 2% to 3%. Hoping you can give some sense on how you see the pricing stat developing next year? And then specifically, just on the acuity mix, obviously another strong quarter there. Is there any way to exclude COVID out and give us a sense of what that is, sort of either year-over-year or relative to 2019? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Hi Rob. Thanks. Well, as I said -- this is Sam. We do anticipate that acuity levels will be strong as we move forward into 2022. Our COVID -- our non-COVID acuity levels for the year have been up compared to 2019. And so we have seen a natural lift in acuity. Part of that is strategic. Part of that is some migration into outpatient. And part of that is just sort of the environment that we're in, we believe. So we anticipate that acuity levels will remain strong. I don't know that we've assigned a metric to it at this particular point in time. But if you look at our non-COVID activity for the year as a whole, it is up compared to 2019. And so we anticipate that, at this particular juncture, continuing into 2022.
Operator: Our next question is from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Frank Morgan: Just curious on the surgery side. Any additional color you could provide to us on a regional basis between in and outpatient and freestanding surgical volumes and where you saw the biggest impact for COVID? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Well, our inpatient surgeries were the only metric, again, as I mentioned in my comments that were down for the quarter. And that's because we used a lot of the space that was necessary for COVID patients. Our outpatient activity was up. It was up 7%. It was up more in our freestanding ASCs than it was in our hospitals, but both were up. And then when you look at it against 2019, I think, again, we had growth, with the exception of inpatient surgery freight. And that, again, is a direct correlation to the fact that we needed that space for COVID inpatients in order to manage our capacity from both staffing and a bed standpoint.
Frank Morgan: And just in the -- just from a geographic standpoint, on the outpatient side, did you notice any more of an effect in, say, the Texas and Florida markets, say, an outpatient because of COVID? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: I don't have all of it in front of me. Obviously, Florida and Texas were very intense geographies for us with the Delta variant. And so it's reasonable to assume that that's where we had more pressure in those markets than we did in other parts of the country. But that would be my reaction to that question, Frank.
Operator: Our next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Pito Chickering: Thanks for taking my questions. For your 2022 revenue commentary, you talked about the Kai -- acuity procedures continuing. Just curious sort of what is fueling that? What areas are driving that? Is it cardio recovering, orthopedics, etcetera? And then as I think about 2022 and beyond, just a question for you, once you get over sort of the noise from COVID, does your long-term EBITDA growth that you've laid out in the past, does it still of continue from these levels once you get through the noise of '21 and 2022? Thanks so much. 
Sam Hazen: Thanks. Our belief is that demand for health care services is still strong. We think it's going to be 1.5% to 2% when you look out into the intermediate run and so forth. And we think for HCA, we have a differentiated portfolio of markets. And we have strong economies underneath that differentiated portfolio, where population growth, job growth and so forth is existent. And then we've had this pattern and we think this pattern can continue of market share gains. And as we look at where we are today versus where we were heading into 2020, we think we've improved our overall positioning competitively with the broader networks, more physicians, better clinical outcomes and so forth. And we will continue to resource our model. And we think that model still has growth embedded in it because of these factors. And we're not ready to give any particular guidance as it relates to out years. But we do think the company's approach can still yield successful return for our shareholders.
Operator: The next question is from Whit Mayo with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. 
Whit Mayo: As I sort of reflect back on commentary a year ago, Sam, you referenced a lot of I guess, we'll call it emerging pop-up growth opportunities. I sort of think the ability to align closer to certain medical groups comes to mind. It might just be helpful to hear how some of these opportunities have evolved over the last 18 months. And maybe I mean this in the context of market share shifts, etcetera. But just any high-level observations or thoughts would be helpful? Thanks. 
Sam Hazen: Thank you, Whit. Well, let me start with the fact that our most recent market share data that we have, which is late last year, 2020 or first part of this year, I don't remember the exact period, shows us at a high watermark. We picked up market share in 2020 when I look at just sort of what happened in that year. So, I'll start with that. Additionally, we have added to our networks. We have added, in some cases, a few hospitals here and there, whether it's new hospitals that have opened or we've had small acquisitions of hospitals to round out our network offering. But in particular, on the outpatient side, we've added a reasonable number of new facilities, whether it's new urgent care center platform, new freestanding emergency rooms, some ambulatory surgery. And then we've added to our physician platform over the last 18 months. Some of which has been development of existing practices in our communities, but also new practice acquisitions that have added to our offerings. I think our outpatient facility capability is up to about 2,200 outpatient facilities. At the end of 2019, it was just a little north of 2,000. So we continue to add capabilities and convenience for our patients, again, creating a broader network offering in these communities. We have done some acquisitions. Our pipeline as it relates to outpatient acquisitions is strong. Also, our development pipeline of new outpatient facilities is robust, and we fueled that with investment. And then as Bill indicated, we have a strong pipeline of projects that will come online in 2022 and 2023 that are connected to both our hospital platform as well as our outpatient platform. So, we see, again, the model, the flywheel, if you will, of HCA continuing to produce solid results and deliver value to our patients and value to our shareholders.
Operator: The next question is from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Lance Wilkes: Yes, I just wanted to follow up on the capital deployment theme. And if you could talk a little bit about what you're looking at as far as enterprise assets that sit atop the local markets. And in particular, earlier in the year, you were talking about the flywheel concept and looking at digital or virtual assets or other sorts of assets that might feed into it. But just interesting if you had any evolution and thought as to what you're going to be focused on there and then if there's any progress reports on that? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: All right. Thank you, Lance. We do see complementary opportunities to use digital capabilities more effectively in our company. As I've mentioned on previous calls, advancing technology in our organization is a tremendous opportunity to improve care, support our physicians and nurses with decision-making capabilities as well as a more safe environment. We also see with that more consistency and transparency, which we believe can produce more efficiencies as we go through it. So, we've got a number of initiatives that are connected to that. In addition to that component, we are using telemedicine to support outreach to our patient population, and meet them where they want to be. And then we see opportunities for telemedicine to support what goes on inside of our facilities and preserve better care for our patients by helping our physicians and our nurses with really extended capabilities that can come from telemedicine inside the walls of our hospitals. So, those areas are progressing. They're showing early signs of value in some instances. And then when they connect with our care transformation agenda, which is being led by one of our physicians and his team, we're very excited about what that potentially yields in the form of better care, more efficient care and so forth. So, we have a number of initiatives underway. They're not completely implemented across the company because we're still studying what are the best approaches. But we're pretty excited about what this agenda can do for our organization.
Operator: The next question is from Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jamie Perse: Good morning guys. thanks for the question. Early in the pandemic, you outlined a couple of different phases of cost opportunities that you were thinking about. How are those tracking? And how much more of the base cost structure can you optimize? And are those enough to offset some of the incremental wage pressures you're dealing with and other inflationary pressures out there?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. This is Bill. Thanks for the question. As we have talked about before, we have resiliency efforts underway. We started last year. Those efforts continue. We have some of those efforts that are implemented and we're realizing the benefits now. And we have some of those efforts that are still in the early stages of implementation that will provide benefit going to the future. We do expect some of those areas to help offset some of the inflationary increases we might see. These efforts are centered around utilizing our scale, where we have the ability to consolidate and standardize functions that may be distributed right now. They're also looking at some structural changes in terms of how we support our field-based operations. So we have a number of efforts underway. Some of them are at the completion stage, and the benefits are being realized as we speak. And some of them still are in the early stages that will provide benefit going forward. So it's an important part of our activity level right now. We have teams focused on a variety of efforts. And we have a certain governance structure in place to make sure that they get executed timely. So they will continue going forward.
Operator: The next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
A.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi everybody. And Mark I don’t know if we’re going to have you on the fourth quarter call, so I just would say, congratulations on your retirement and best wishes. I want to ask about the capital deployment a little further. Obviously, this year, you did $6 billion. You're on – you've done $6 billion of share repurchases. When you think about capital deployment going forward, what kind of pace do you think is reasonable for that? And I know you've already announced the Salt Lake City deal. So on the side of coming out of the pandemic, hospital assets or other more significant assets that might be available, can you talk about that pipeline? And specifically with Salt Lake, when you made your comments, Bill, about next year's growth, I'm assuming, until that deal closes, you're not incorporating that in your commentary. My understanding it's about $90 million to $100 million of EBITDA.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. A.J., you are correct. We are not incorporating anything into that into our commentary at this point in time. Relating to the capital allocation, let me step back and talk a little broadly about that. As I mentioned in my comments, we are in a very strong position as we approach our capital allocation decisions for next year given our cash flow generation, the balance sheet position and liquidity we're carrying. As we've described in the past, we're really focused on what I described as a balanced approach to capital, with our first priority is evaluating opportunity to deploy capital in our markets to capture growth through our internal capital program. We haven’t finalized on that range yet, but I would anticipate we'll increase it commensurate with the opportunity. So we mentioned in our guidance, it should be somewhere around $3.7 billion this year, maybe a little below that. Prior to the pandemic, we were at $4 billion to $4.2 billion. And so we're evaluating where that should settle for next year. But we think that will be an important part of the continuing our growth. After that, it's a matter of how best to utilize our free cash flow to drive value. A dividend program and share repurchase program, we expect to continue to be an important part of our overall capital allocation process. We haven't finalized that. But we have ample capital capacity to give due consideration to both of those programs. And I would expect them to be part of our balanced portfolio of capital going forward.
Operator: The next question is from John Ransom with Raymond James. Your line is open.
John Ransom: Good morning. I'd add my best wishes to Mr. Kimbrough.
Sam Hazen: He's not leaving yet. We still got him for a little while, but…
Mark Kimbrough: I'll be here for the year-end. Yeah. I get to…
John Ransom: I'm thinking of spelunking or ballroom dancing something. I think you need to take an eccentric hobby.
Mark Kimbrough: That's right.
John Ransom: Just thinking about fourth quarter in conjunction with your guidance, I mean, your labor costs, you talked about it a lot, but they jumped up about 11% after kind of hanging in, in the $640 million range for three quarters. If we think about the fourth quarter, let's say COVID dropped from – drops by 5%, 6%, and so some of that pressure comes off, isn't it reasonable to think that the labor costs get a little bit of a breather sequentially just relative to less acute pressure from what we saw at the Delta wave at the peak in, say, August?
Bill Rutherford: Yeah, John. This is Bill. I think as Sam mentioned in his earlier commentary, we – this quarter was affected by having and gaining the labor at any way we could to support the volume we were seeing. And as COVID does subside, we expect those premium programs that we implemented during the quarter to subside. And then whether it be the utilization of the contract labor, looking at the overtime as well as some of these bonus shift differentials that we had to pay. So we do expect that to come down relative to where we had in third quarter. But we understand there's still pressure in the labor market. So we'll just have to see where that settles out for the fourth quarter.
John Ransom: So I mean, just as a follow-up. So if I think about flat sequential revenue and less acute pressure from labor wouldn't that imply EBITDA going up sequentially, not being flat?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. I understand that question. As we said before, historically, we see some seasonality. We don't know what the seasonality change will be. We think our range provides the opportunity for us to grow at the top end of that. So again, I think just given the environment we're seeing, we're prudent in our range, and that's what we're going with at this point.
Operator: The next question is from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Joshua Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. I'm going to hold my comments on Mark, then I guess, for another 90 days to till we get them for the 4Q. My question is on value-based care. From the perspective that HCA is the largest hospital operator in the country, one of the largest employers of physicians in the country, so do you look at this movement? And it doesn't feel like it's being felt much at the facility level. But do you think there are opportunities for HCA on the hospital side to benefit from value-based care contracts? And then how do you think about opportunities for your physician base? Because I know there's a ton of conversation around enabling providers at this point?
Sam Hazen: Well, we have certain aspects of value-based care embedded in, obviously, Medicare reimbursement. In some of our commercial contracts, we have aspects of value-based care component as part of our reimbursement methodologies. That will continue, I think, into the future. Is it accelerating in our facility structures? No. Inside of our physician platform, we do see opportunities to continue to push further into value-based care. Again, in that particular platform in our company, we have aspects of value-based care. They vary a little bit from one market to the other depending on the circumstances and the demographics and payer dynamics in those markets. So we do see it growing more in the physician platform than on the facility side, I would submit. But I think if you pull up, and you look at our relationships across the organization in the payer environment, they're very strong. We're 80%, 85% contracted for 2022. We're about 50% contracted for 2023 on terms that work for both organizations. They continue a lot of the structure that's already in place. And we evolve, as we renew with what's going on in the marketplace. We are in most commercial contracts in just about every market, where we do business. And in most Medicare Advantage relationships as well. So that's a key part of our approach. And that's why it's important for our model within each of the markets to be comprehensive, both in outpatient offerings, convenient for the patients. And then, having different price points for the payers, but ultimately creating a full system that can offer solutions. And we adjust those solutions to fit the situation with each payer. And some of that, again, can be value based. Some of it can be a different approach as to other reimbursement terms. But we think we're striking the right balance in how we approach that.
Operator: Our next question is from Gary Taylor with Cowen. Your line is open.
Gary Taylor: Good morning guys. Congrats on the quarter. I know it was a very difficult one to manage through. And The Street is always immediately looking for the next data point, maybe not enough credit given, when it's due. So good job on the quarter, I wanted to ask,…
Bill Rutherford: Thank you Gary.
Gary Taylor: …I wanted to ask, I think this primarily goes to Bill. When we look at where your margins were trending a few years pre-pandemic, up a couple of hundred basis points, I think your guidance for next year inherently assumes, margins come back to some degree. And we understand all the factors that have been driving it. The higher occupancy, the better mix, the higher acuity, despite the COVID cost, despite the labor costs, et cetera. But Bill, I feel like a year or so ago, you did talk about some opportunities to take some real sort of permanent efficiencies out of the cost structure. And just wanted to get your thoughts now as we sort of head into 2022 and beyond, should investors think that margins ultimately just go right back to the low-19s? Or are there good reasons structurally to think that maybe you can sustain somewhere in the middle?
Bill Rutherford: Well, Gary, one, thanks. It is a very good question. Assure, we are focused on driving as much efficiency as we can throughout the organization. I think we have a pretty good track record of doing that. You're right. If you go pre-pandemic, we were hovering 19% margins. There are a couple of quarters we'd be in 20%. We've step changed that. Some of that is due to the mix and acuity on there. Our focus will be to continue to drive margins. We have been supported by a couple of those COVID support programs that I spoke about. We fully anticipate once we account for those, that we should maintain and find some resiliency plans and our day-to-day management, is continue to drive efficiencies, utilize the scale of the organization to bring benefits. So I do believe that once we get into a normalized kind of post-COVID surge environment and we compare our current margins to where they were pre-pandemic, you'll see some elevation in there.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Gary.
Gary Taylor: Yeah. Thanks.
SamHazen: Yeah, So when you look at the -- Gary, this is Sam. When you look at the third quarter of 2019, we cleared almost, what I call, 36% of EBITDA clearance. In other words, our margins in 2021 against 2019 were two times what the average margin was in 2019. And so obviously, it's significant compared to that same period then and we do see some structural pieces that Bill was alluding to. Obviously, there's a potential of inflation that we have to figure out exactly what the implications of that are. And we think some of our strategies will mitigate it. But we have been able to reposition the profitability of the company. And we're pushing to try to sustain those gains as much as we possibly can.
Operator: The next question is from Andrew Mok with UBS Financial. Your line is open.
Andrew Mok: Good morning. First, one clarification, then, I'll get to my question. Bill, earlier, I think you said 5% to 6% core EBITDA growth off of the earnings base ex-government aid. If so, it sounds like you actually expect accelerating growth in 2022, compared to the long-term growth target of 4% to 6%. Is that fair?
Bill Rutherford: Well, we have had long-term 4% to 6%. I think if you look at our actual historical, we'd be more in that 5% to 6%. So again, we're in early stages. And the intent was to give you some broad commentary versus specifics on there. So that was how the commentary was structured.
Andrew Mok: And then just a follow-up on the de novo deployment. I think you have at least 20 to 30 de novos underway between ambulatory surgery and inpatient rehab. Can you give us a sense for the cadence of when those facilities come online and the expected profit ramp of those facilities over the next 18 months?
Sam Hazen: I don't have -- I mean we have a pipeline of urgent care that I know is coming online in 2022 or 2023, again through acquisition or de novo development. We have maybe 10 or 12 ambulatory surgery centers. Some of which come online in the fourth quarter, some -- most come online in 2022 of that particular component. And then we have some other outpatient facilities that -- maybe 15 or so, and those categories come online in 2022, with another 15 or so in 2023. So we have a lot in different categories coming online. And that's part of the continued addition to our 2,200 outpatient facilities. And so I don't have the earnings expectations around those or a composite on each -- all of them in total. We -- but we do have a pretty active development. And those are complementary. And there's a natural ramp in them as well. And for the most part, we're really bullish on the prospects for those outpatient facilities.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call over to Mr. Kimbrough for any closing remarks.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Chris, thank you so much for your help today. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call. I hope you have a wonderful weekend. I'm around this afternoon, if I can answer any additional questions you might have. Take care.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-20 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the HCA Healthcare Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.  At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I will like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Katherine. Good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam and Bill, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based upon management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Healthcare is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning and thank you for joining us. With the effects of the pandemic moderating in the second quarter, we experienced a strong rebound in demand for our services. COVID admissions in the quarter were down to 3% of total as compared to 10% in the first quarter.  Volumes across all categories grew significantly compared to last year. And notably, we grew inpatient admissions and outpatient surgeries over 2019. The growth was supported by an improved payer mix, which resulted from an increase in commercial volume.  On a year-over-year basis, revenues grew 30% to $14.4 billion. Inpatient revenues increased 20%, driven by 17.5% admission growth. Outpatient revenues grew an impressive 59%, reflecting the resurgence in outpatient demand across most categories. To highlight a few areas. Outpatient surgeries were up 53%, emergency room visits grew 40%, cardiology procedures increased 41% and urgent care visits were up 82%. Compared to 2019, overall inpatient admissions grew almost 3% with commercial admissions growing 8%. Outpatient surgeries grew approximately 3.5%. Emergency room visits were only down 5.5% with the month of June basically flat. Acuity, however, in our emergency rooms was up with moderate growth in the most acute categories. We were able to leverage the increased revenue into higher margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved compared to last year, excluding the government stimulus income and sequentially in comparison to the first quarter. Diluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, increased 35% to $4.37.  As noted in our release, EPS in the second quarter of 2020 included a $1.73 per diluted share benefit from government stimulus income. This benefit was reversed in the third quarter of 2020, as a result of the decision we made to return our entire share of provider relief funds from the CARES Act.  Once again, our teams delivered on our operating agenda. I want to thank them for their dedication and hard work. As we look to the rest of the year, we have raised our annual guidance to reflect the performance of the company over the first half of the year, and the belief that the current levels of demand should prolong over the remainder of the year. We continue to invest aggressively in our strategic plan, which revolves around building greater clinical capabilities to serve our communities, while also developing more comprehensive enterprise resources to support caregivers and differentiate our local networks. We believe this operating model will continue to create value for our patients, deliver market share growth and produce solid returns for our shareholders.  Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Bill for more details.
Bill Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will discuss our cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter, then review our updated 2021 guidance. As a result of the strong operating performance in the quarter, our cash flow from operations was 2.25 billion as compared to 8.7 billion in the second quarter of 2020.  In the prior year period, cash flow from operations was positively impacted by approximately 5.8 billion due to CARES Act receipts. And this year, we had approximately 850 million more income tax payments in the quarter than the prior year, due to the deferral of our second quarter 2020 estimated tax payments.  Capital spending for the quarter was 842 million, and we have approximately 3.8 billion of approved capital in the pipeline that is scheduled to come online between now and the end of 2023. We completed just under 2.3 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. We have approximately 5 billion remaining on our authorization. And consistent with our year-end discussion, we are planning on completing the majority of this in 2021, subject to market conditions.  Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.65x and we had approximately 5.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Meadows Regional Hospital in Vidalia, Georgia. We also closed on the Brookdale home health and hospice transaction as of July 1, 2021.  We have a number of other development transactions in our pipeline to expand our regional delivery networks, including over 15 surgery center additions through both de novo development and acquisitions as well as a number of urgent care and physician practice acquisitions.  We also anticipate the closing of our previously announced facility divestitures in Georgia later this quarter, and we plan to use the proceeds from this transaction for other capital allocation purposes.  As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2021 guidance as follows. We now expect revenues to range between 57 billion and 58 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between 12.1 billion and 12.5 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $16.30 and $17.10 per share. And our capital spending target remains at approximately 3.7 billion. As Sam mentioned, our revised guidance considers the strong results in the first half of the year, and our belief in the company's ability to continue this performance for the remainder of the year.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark and open it up for Q&A.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Sam, Bill, thank you so much. Katherine, I think we're ready for questions now if you could give instructions to the callers on the queue. Please limit yourself to one question so that we can try to get as many as possible. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hi. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a solid quarter. I guess, Bill, I'll follow up on the last part of your comment on the guidance. So you're expecting continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2. So, how are you thinking about the delta variants coming up? And just in terms of the backlog that you're seeing in terms of procedures that was delayed on the elective side from last year?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Brian, it’s Bill. I’ll take that. Obviously, our guidance factors in a lot of variables. We believe, overall, our volume, as indicated in the second quarter, will return to 2019 levels and perhaps moderately above that. We think we can maintain the acuity levels, even though that some lower acuity may come back into the system of the balance of the year. And overall, the overall payer mix I think will remain strong. Relative to COVID, as we mentioned in our year-end results, we anticipated serving COVID throughout all of the year, and indeed we're seeing that. As Sam mentioned in his comments, roughly 3% of our admissions were COVID in the second quarter compared to 10% in the first quarter. And I think we've proven the ability to manage through different cycles as they present themselves. And so we factored a number of variables into our guidance and believe, again, in the performance of the company to be able to deliver that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Pito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Great job here in the quarter in 2021. Guidance now brackets consensus for 2023. I understand it's way too early to think about 2022, but the new guidance begs that question a little bit. So if we think about the midpoint of 2021 guidance of 12.3 billion and we back out $600 million of government spending from sequestration, HR say in other COVID payments to about 11.7 billion. Is that the right launch pad for 2022? And if we assume a 4% EBITDA growth to get us to 12.2 billion for 2022, is that the right way to think about next year?
Bill Rutherford: Well, Pito, let me start and add Sam. I think it's a little early to put math to 2022 numbers. We obviously have some puts and takes going out through 2021. You correctly anticipate the government stimulus to approximate 600 million for full year. But it's really too early to start putting numbers to 2021. We do feel confident in the general direction that the company is seeing. And so, again, we'll reserve comments on specific guidance for 2022 at this standpoint.
Sam Hazen: And Pito, this is Sam. I want to add to Bill's comments there. I think when you think about the near term, and we're not defining that as '22. We're defining it as over a reasonable period of time post this year. We do believe that demand growth for healthcare services over the near term is going to remain solid. And we think with a differentiated portfolio of markets that we have inside of HCA Healthcare, that helps support that particular belief.  The second belief we have is that our provider system model has unique strength, and will allow us to compete effectively for market share. We also had a number of initiatives that we believe are appropriate in creating better services and more value for our stakeholders. And we think these will create opportunities for us as well. And then as Bill alluded to in his comments, our capital investment strategy, our balance sheet flexibility, really provides us support also for near-term objectives. And so we will get through the next quarter. And hopefully, by that time have some perspective, as we have in the past on how we see the upcoming year. But this is more of our near-term beliefs, and we think these are reasonable for the operations of our company.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Pito. Katherine?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. So if I could beat on margins I guess. How should we think about the normalized margin for you guys? And we're hearing more and more about labor pressure. So how are you thinking about specifically how labor might impact margins in the coming years?
Sam Hazen: Well, this is Sam. Let me speak to our labor agenda in general. First of all, our employees over the past 18 months have been just incredible. They stepped up. They’ve shown up. They've delivered on our mission. They've delivered for their communities and they’ve delivered for their patients. Obviously, as other industries are experiencing, we are in a difficult labor market. I will tell you that we have numerous initiatives underway to improve our overall position. We have invested significant amounts of resources into our recruitment functions. We have advanced our expansion of our Galen School of Nursing. And then we have put in compensation adjustments, some of which were in our numbers this quarter and some of which will show themselves in the future.  What we are encouraged by is each month this year, we've seen sequential improvement in overall labor metrics with respect to turnover, with respect to recruitment. And so we're encouraged by our efforts up to this point. I will also tell you that our labor costs from the second quarter to the -- from the first quarter rather to the second quarter are essentially stable, which gives us some confidence that our efforts are working. Obviously, there's still uncertainty with respect to inflation. We will be focused on doing the right thing for our employees as we move forward in managing through this period. And we think, again, we have a number of initiatives that can help address some of these pressures that might evolve.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: Good morning. I wanted to follow up on Kevin's question, just talking specifically on margins. They're up 200 basis points versus 2019 and what you guided to originally pre-COVID in 2020. So I'm just wondering if you could break that down maybe between better acuity you've seen, better payer mix, the cost cutting you've done, and maybe some of the government program dollars, and just talk about the sustainability there. And then I apologize if I missed this, Bill, but if you could run up the acuity numbers, that would be great as well. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. So, Justin, obviously, a lot of factors go into the margins. You see in our guidance, we're raising our margin expectations compared to our original discussion as we went into the year. And I think that's reflective of all the variables. Clearly margin is being driven by the volume returns to 2019 levels, the favorable acuity, as well as the favorable payer mix. And then we continue to have a number of cost initiatives that we're managing through.  So, as we think about where we stand today and the balance of the year, the margins reflect more like our average that we've experienced over the past four quarters. The acuity, we still saw some growth in 2020. It was about 2% growth over 2020, about 5% growth over 2019 levels. So that's continuing to show strength. And so we'll have to see where that falls out for the balance of the year. But overall, we feel reasonably confident on the margin projections we have. And I think our guidance reflects a pretty significant increase in the margin expectations compared to where our original expectations were as we turn the calendar.
Mark Kimbrough: All right, Justin, thank you so much. Katherine?
Operator: Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Impressive quarter across the board really. I guess, I'll just try to drill down a little bit more on what you're seeing volume wise. I know the market share of third party statistics come in with the delay, but I'm assuming you have some sort of local assessments you do. How much of the volume rebound is stronger than I would have thought certainly to be ahead of '19 levels? It's impressive. How much of that do you think is your picking up market even the way you responded to COVID, your investments you’ve done on the CapEx side?  And how much is the underlying market? And you're expressing confidence about the back half the year. Do you have any -- I guess you have some scheduling of procedures that you can look at and what the physicians are telling you and you own a lot of physicians. So maybe just something about why you're confident on the volume sort of having that sustainability as opposed to this being a spike that then moderates?
Mark Kimbrough: All right, A.J. Thank you. Sam, Bill?
Sam Hazen: Yes. This is Sam, A.J. Thank you for that question. We have had fits and starts over the last three or four quarters with a couple of months here, a couple of months there, then we went into COVID surges and it had created difficulties in our ability to judge precisely where we were in the market. So we've had essentially four solid months; March, April, May and June, where we've been able to judge the market with some level of confidence. And what we see is, as I mentioned, the ability to move markets here. I don't know that we moved in this last quarter necessarily, because we don't have the data. But if you look at our progression over time, you've seen a pattern of market share growth. And again, I think that speaks to the model, I think it speaks to the resource allocation that we put forth and it speaks to the execution by our teams in the field. And so we're really proud of that. At the beginning of 2011, we had 23% market share. At the end of that decade, we had over 27%. We have continued to see annual growth in our most recent data points. So we believe that system capability still exists and it’s possibly showing itself in the second quarter, but we need more time to fully judge that. But these four months have given us a reasonable perspective on what's happening in the markets; job growth, more people insured with the Affordable Care Act, investments that we're making, execution on our physician and program development strategy, and continuing to manage the network most effectively we think gives us reasonable visibility into the last half of the year. And that's why we're judging that the demand is going to endure over the remaining two quarters. So we don't have anything other than our analysis of these four months, A.J., that would suggest it. But we believe with our study [Technical Difficulty] their individual markets. So that's the reason for the guidance.
Mark Kimbrough: A.J., thank you for the question. Katherine?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens.
Mark Kimbrough: Hi, Scott.
Scott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to just ask a follow-up question around the planned capital investments that you highlighted that were north of 3 billion through 2023. And specifically just interested if you can talk about the mix of those investments as they relate to inpatient versus let’s call it outpatient and tertiary and other investments? Just interested in, as you look sort of historically at the mix of investments, how those may be evolving as we've seen some shifts in site of care clearly playing out post pandemic? Thanks.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Sam?
Sam Hazen: Yes. This is Sam. Just so you have a sense of our networks today, we have roughly 185 hospitals. And then we have over 2,000, almost 2,200 outpatient facilities. So think about our network as almost 11 to 1, outpatient to hospital. Now the capital intensity in the 185 hospitals is clearly more than the outpatient facility. So as Bill mentioned in his comments, we have a significant amount of capital going to ambulatory surgery centers, but amatory surgery center per unit is only $10 million or $12 million in order to get an investment done, a urgent care center is a couple million, a freestanding emergency room is $10 million investment. So these are small dollar unit investments, but they add to our network capability and then support our hospitals in a way that ultimately create hopefully a closed loop where a patient can stay inside of one of our systems, because of the services and so forth that we offer. As it relates to our capital investment, our hospitals will always consume more of the capital just because of the intensity that it requires to have the brick and mortar associated with the heavy clinical equipment and such. But we have plenty of capacity in our spending, allowing us to invest aggressively in our outpatient network to support our facilities. So we're adding this to our facilities in many markets, because we're still running at very high occupancies. I think our occupancy in the second quarter was 73%. We have 41,000 beds in HCA operational, and we're running north of 30,000 patients a day inside of those facilities. And then as we speak to building out our capabilities, we are investing in many outpatient and ambulatory facilities, creating a more convenient, easier to access offering for our patients at a better price point so that it fits within our overall network configuration. But those investments, again, will not overcome the amount of inpatient investments that we make. Additionally, we are investing in our technology platforms and we will continue to invest in technology. We see a real opportunity in the future to advance technology and enable the company even more significantly than we do today, delivering what we believe to be an opportunity for much better care, do it in a more engaging way with our patient population, and then ultimately achieve efficiencies as a result of those investments. We're very excited about that platform. More to come on that in the future, but we see opportunities there as well.
Mark Kimbrough: Scott, thank you for your question. Katherine, next question please.
Operator: Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.
Mark Kimbrough: Hi, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So you guys mentioned commercial up I think 8% over 2019. Can you maybe just give us a sense of volume trends for Medicare and Medicaid? And then any way to gauge population growth, particularly in your Texas and Florida markets, and maybe how much that's aided the payer mix at this point? Thanks.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Ralph.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Ralph, this is Bill. I think we saw recovery volume in every payer class, and that includes Medicare. Our Medicare volume was just under 4% below '19 levels, and that compares to where we have been running 8% to 10% below. So we’ve seen recovering volume in the Medicare class as well. Obviously, it's more favorable in the commercial and managed care. So that's resulting in a strong overall payer mix area. In terms of overall demand, I don't have information on that. We're generally a couple of quarters in arrears to see that. So we're going to have to just wait to see when that data comes out. Our belief just looking and hearing the markets as we see demand recovering as the economy and markets are opening back up, we'll have to see what that actually yields in terms of the percentage of demand that we're seeing. But it's our belief we're starting to see demand recover throughout most of our markets.
Mark Kimbrough: All right, Ralph, thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research.
Mark Kimbrough: Hi, Josh. Good morning.
Joshua Raskin: Hi. Good morning. Just the ED visits I know are running 5.5% below 2019 in the quarter. I think you said June was almost flat. Are those stabilizing in your view? Is that the new normal level? Do you think EDs have actually fully recovered back to pre-pandemic levels? And then are you seeing any changes in the percentage of those ED visits that are getting admitted, that are becoming actual admissions and maybe even any differences by payer segment?
Sam Hazen: Well, one month, June, doesn't necessarily suggest a pattern. Although we think the second quarter is more likely reflective of activity in the ER than previous quarters when we were down 15% to 20%. We knew there would be some recovery in the emergency rooms. And we haven't seen the effects of schools going back yet either. So that is an area our pediatric activity where we've seen significant shortfalls by comparison to 2019 still even in the second quarter. So that would provide some potential support as kids get back to school and engage in their normal activities. As it relates to the acuity of our emergency room population throughout 2020 and on into the first half of 2021, we have continued to see in our emergency rooms more acute patient populations. That has in fact yielded admission growth in our emergency rooms. Our admissions grew in the second quarter of '21 over '19 as a result of that acuity, and we anticipate that that will also endure throughout the remainder of the year.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Josh, thank you so much for your question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.
Jamie Perse: Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to go back to the EBITDA margin piece and your guidance for the rest of the year. It looks like the second half guidance implies a lower margin rate than the first half of the year. So I wanted to get any specific incremental pressures you see for the balance of the year. On a related note to premium labor utilization and premium labor rates, are those continued to come down relative to recent trends?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, let me start with margins. As I tried to talk about before as we kind of project the balance of the year, there's a lot of variables that go into that. And I think you'll see that our margin that we're projecting is a pretty significant increase from our original projection, and more looks like our margin average for the past four quarters. And we'll just have to see how the various variables play out. We don't have anything specific we're calling out on that. We know we're running a little high in the first half. I think some of our first quarter COVID volume maybe contributed to that. But our margins for the full year are really reflective of our past four quarter average. On the premium labor, Sam?
Sam Hazen: Well, we did have more premium labor utilization in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter, and that put a little pressure on our labor costs. We were able to absorb that with the volume and the outpatient activity that we mentioned. We anticipate, again, that our labor agenda for recruitment, retention, compensation adjustments and so forth will start to moderate that pressure over the remainder of the year. But we continue to be mindful of that particular item. But obviously, we're having to staff the volume that we've gotten, in some instances -- many instances actually, we're having to use premium labor at this point.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Jamie, thank you so much.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.
Mark Kimbrough: Hi, Lance.
Lance Wilkes: Hi. How are you doing? Great quarter. Just if I could ask about impacts of value-based care on the business, in particular impacts on volumes. Just interested if that's causing any pressure in any particular markets where you're seeing the rise of some of those risks there in primary care, or if it's in fact helping you if you're taking more of that share? And maybe just a quick cleanup question on Medicaid volume relative to 2019, if you're seeing that up or down?
Sam Hazen: Thank you. We’ve spoken to value-based programs over the years and nothing has really changed in our estimation over the past year, year and a half with respect to those. In many markets, we have to respond to the dynamics in those markets. South Florida's probably the most advanced managed care market in the country. We have 24%, 25% market share in that particular region, with many investments underway to improve our position overall. So our ability navigating some of the deepest and most complex managed care markets I think has been proven over time. We nuance our strategy from one market to the other, to respond to what our payers feel they need to be responsive to their customer base. We have great relationship, great partnerships in many instances with the various payers. We're in a great position as it looks to 2022 with respect to our contracting. And so I think from that standpoint, nothing material is out there, either influencing demand in any significant way, nor putting us in a position where we don't feel like we're appropriately positioned with the payers’ objectives in allowing them to push forward on whatever agenda they think appropriate. 
Bill Rutherford: Hi, Lance. This is Bill. On your Medicaid question, we're up about 4% over 2019 on a year-to-date basis. We were relatively flat first quarter and we're up just under 9% in the second quarter.
Mark Kimbrough: Okay. All right. We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. Obviously, we're excited about the quarter. I’m around if you have any additional questions for the rest of the week, and please feel free to give me a call. Thank you so much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I will like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Kara. Good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks, and then we will take questions afterward. Before I turn the call over to Sam and Bill, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based upon management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from these - from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release as well as in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable - attributable to HCA Healthcare Inc. is included in today's release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Thank you, Mark. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge, we started the year with strong financial results in the first quarter. The results were driven by better-than-expected revenue growth and improved operating margins. Revenues grew over $1.1 billion, or 8.7% as compared to the prior year. This growth was generated by highly acute inpatient volumes, better payer mix, and a rebound in surgical and outpatient volumes in March. Generally speaking, March trends are continuing into April. Inpatient revenues increased by 12%. The acuity within our inpatient business was higher as reflected in both the case mix index, which increased 7% and length of stay which grew by 6%. Additionally, commercial admits inside of our domestic operations represented 29% of total admits, compared to 26.5% last year. Commercial payer mix has been consistently around this level for the past four quarters. These two factors combined explain the 17% increase in inpatient revenue per admissions. The total - the total admits were down 4.2% year-over-year. In comparison to 2019, admits were down approximately 3%, which was - which was in line with our expectations. In the quarter, we treated almost 50,000 COVID-19 inpatients, which represented 10% of total admissions. Throughout the quarter, the percentage of COVID-19 admits to total admits declined. January with 17%, February was 8%, and March was down to almost 5%. Outpatient revenues increased 4.7% as compared to prior year. This result is better performance than the previous two quarters in which outpatient revenue was down approximately 5%. Outpatient revenues declined in January and February, consistent with that trend. But March, which had one additional weekday this year, increased by 30% as outpatient surgery and other procedures recovered strongly. Same facility outpatient surgery volumes grew 2.3% as compared to last year. As compared to 2019, they declined 3%. E.R. visits declined 18%. This decrease is generally consistent with the trends we experienced in the previous two quarters. E.R. visits were down 19% compared to 2019. Our teams continue to focus and deliver on our operating agenda. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the company grew on a year-over-year basis and was consistent on a sequential basis with the prior quarter. Diluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales, as well as losses on debt retirement, increase 78% to $4.14. During the quarter, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire a majority stake in the home health and hospitals business of Brookdale Senior Living. This business provides us with a large platform that complements our local provider systems. It will expand the services we offer across our networks and provide us with more enterprise capabilities to coordinate care for our patients and improve their experiences. Additionally, we believe the home will become a more important setting for healthcare in the future with continuing growth and demand. We anticipate this transaction will close in the third quarter and we look forward to our new partnership with Brookdale. Also during the quarter, we opened two new hospitals, one in Denver and one in Orlando. Each of these hospitals will strengthen our system offerings in these communities. In the second quarter, we expect to close on the acquisitions of two small hospitals both of which complement our networks in Nashville and Savannah. And lastly, we continue to invest broadly across our networks to improve convenience, access, and value for patients by developing more outpatient facilities. The pipeline for development and acquisition in this category remains strong. As we look to the rest of the year, we have increased our annual guidance to reflect the first quarter's performance and better perspective on important macro factors. Mainly, governmental reimbursement and economic outlooks for our markets, including uninsured assumptions. Bill will provide more details on our guidance in his comments. The first quarter is yet another period where the disciplined operating culture and strong execution by our teams were on display. I want to thank our 275,000 colleagues and 50,000 physicians for their tremendous work. We could not have performed at this level without their unwavering commitment to our patients and the communities we serve. As we continue to resource and execute on our strategic agenda, we will remain true to our mission of improving lives and delivering on the responsibilities we have to all our stakeholders. And now, I turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Rutherford: Good morning, everyone. Sam spoke to many of our operating metrics and results. So I will discuss our cash flow and capital allocation activity during the quarter. Then review our updated 2021 guidance. As a result of the strong operating performance in the quarter, our cash flow from operations was $1.99 billion, as compared to $1.375 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Capital spending for the quarter was $654 million, and we completed just over $1.5 billion of share repurchases during the quarter. We have approximately $7.3 billion remaining on our authorization. And consistent with our year end discussion, we are planning on completing the majority of this in 2021, subject to market conditions. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage was 2.85 times, and we had approximately $5.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2021 guidance as follows. We expect revenue to range between $54 billion and $55.5 billion. We expect full year EBITDA to range between $10.85 billion and $11.35 billion. We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $13.30 and $14.30 and our capital spending target remains at approximately $3.7 billion. Our revised guidance considers the strong results in the first quarter and also considers the extension of the public health emergency and the deferral of sequestration reductions through the end of the year. In summary, we recognize some uncertainties remain as we go through the balance of the year, but we are confident in the company's ability to manage through various business cycles, and we are well positioned to continue to invest capital to capture growth opportunities and execute on acquisition opportunities if they become available. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark and then open up for Q&A.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Sam. Kara, we’re going to open-up for questions. Please remind everyone to limit their questions to one so that we might get try and get as many in the queue as possible.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Pito Chickering: [Technical Difficulty]
Mark Kimbrough: Hey, Pito, Pito you’re breaking up. I can’t hear you. Kara, let's try with next one, Pito try calling back in.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I guess my question would be on guidance. I guess, first a clarification. Your guidance, I assume, does not include the two deals you expect in Q2 or the Brookdale acquisition, but then more to the point as far as guidance. How do you think about the upside? Because it sounded like a lot of the raise is because of sequestration and the extension of the health emergency. I mean, how much of this outperformance and guidance rate do you think of as kind of one-time versus things that we should be thinking about as you having a better visibility into future growth in 2022 and 2023?
Bill Rutherford: Thanks, Kevin. Kevin, let me answer that. First, you're right. The acquisitions for the balance of the year are not included in our expectations, but we don't expect that material contribution from those – for this year. Relative to our increase in guidance, largely due to the strong performance that we had in the first quarter is the driver of that. As Sam talked, we have some insight into March and the read-through through April. And then we did consider the continuation of the deferral of sequestration through the balance of the year. And we know the public health emergency got extended at least through 90 days through July. So the majority of the guidance range is a result of our performance from the first quarter and considers the extension of the sequestration on there. So, as we've talked about at our year-end call, there's still variables out there, but the way we're reading the environment right now is generally positive.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Kevin. Kara, next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan: Margins and obviously, big expansion year-over-year and you sustained nice margins from the previous quarter. But can you just give us any more color around the dynamics of your ability to continue to manage costs this way? I mean, it really looked like it was across everything, labor supplies, other. Is it more a function of just the top line growth? Or is there something structural on the cost side that's allowing you to take advantage of having flex labor. Just any color there would be appreciated. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Frank, this is Bill. I'll start. I think the margin is primarily attributable to the top line with the revenue and the acuity and the payer mix that we had. But we continue to be focused on looking for efficiencies throughout the company, as we've talked about our resiliency plans in the past. And so those efforts continue, and many of them are well underway in almost every category. And so that is a part of the performance of the company. But the margins clearly are being helped by both the acuity and the payer mix and the revenue per adjusted admission that we're seeing. But as we've talked about multiple times, we are continuing to look for as much efficiency as we can as we go through different cycles. And many of those efforts continue to be underway.
Sam Hazen: Bill, if I can just add to that. Our cost per adjusted patient day was in line with our expectations and actually slightly underneath that. And so we were only seeing in the face of really a difficult labor market, 3% growth in cost per adjusted patient day. So I think, it's a combination of both, but obviously, with the mix, that helps, Frank.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Frank.
Frank Morgan: Thank you.
Mark Kimbrough: Kara?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.
Sam Hazen: Hey, A.J.
A.J. Rice: Hi. Maybe just ask a little bit more about the capital deployment opportunities. I know last quarterly call, you guys had mentioned potentially looking at some post-acute care dynamic. And then obviously, you've had the announcement about Brookdale. Perhaps that was what you were alluding to last quarter. But maybe talk about your appetite there and whether you're seeing broader health system. I know you have two hospital deals, but maybe broader health systems, there was some thought that they might look to partner up coming out of the pandemic? Or have you seen any uptick in activity there? And then finally, on this capital deployment, spending around your CapEx, are you moving – I mean, you're still emphasizing access points, but I wondered whether investments in ER, for example, might be diminished given what we've seen coming out of the pandemic and less ER activity, maybe you've diverted some of that money elsewhere. So, just some comments on capital deployment opportunities.
Sam Hazen: Okay. A.J., this is Sam. I'll try to respond to those. I remember all the elements. On post-acute, let me speak to that. Obviously, home care opportunity and hospice opportunity to us, we believe, is a significant expansion of the services we offer. And the opportunities for integrating those patients who are discharged and we discharge about 250,000 patients a year into home care creates an opportunity for us to coordinate care better, stay connected to the patient after they leave our facilities and ultimately integrate them more effectively in the HCA Healthcare system. So we see a nice broad opportunity. We believe home care provides multiple channels of value for us, some of which are in the discharges that we talked about, some of it's in better case management and discharge planning and some of it is staying connected to the patient when they repurchase healthcare. Also on post-acute, we mentioned before because of the CON relaxation in Florida, we have made a large commitment to inpatient rehabilitation facilities in the state of Florida, where we have the greatest opportunity to do the same thing with rehab. So we've invested somewhere between $250 million and $300 million or we are investing rather in developing rehab services in the state of Florida, which will expand the offerings in those markets to our patients and support our systems. So we still see potential in both of those areas to expand into more significant relationships with Medicare Advantage payers potentially on post-acute, so it creates opportunities for us in multiple ways.  As it relates to our capital spending, as we mentioned in our guidance for 2021, we are increasing our capital budget to somewhere around $3.7 billion. Much of that increase is related to growth projects where we are expanding at facilities where we need to expand. We're still running the company north of 70% inpatient occupancy, and many of our facilities are north of that. And so in order for us to capitalize on this differentiated portfolio we have, where we believe our markets have unique growth prospects because of great economies, population growth and so forth, we need to create capacity both on the inpatient in certain circumstances and build out the networks additionally with outpatient facilities as we mentioned. With respect to ER specifically, we do see ample supply, generally speaking, with our ER beds today. We will have some continued investments in emergency room supply and capacity across certain markets because, number one, in some cases, we need it. We continue to operate at high levels, or two, we have freestanding emergency room opportunities. And we will invest in those, but they're not nearly as significant as they were five years ago when we were investing more heavily in that. So that flexibility will allow us to invest in ambulatory surgery centers, where we have a tremendously strong pipeline for new development. I think we have 10 or 12 new ambulatory surgery centers that are under development. We have a robust pipeline in that particular category as well. And then we will also invest in urgent care, recognizing that, that continues to serve a role in building out the capabilities inside of our markets. As it pertains to M&A, I do think there are going to be opportunities. As we've mentioned in the past, they come when they come. It's hard for us to predict. We are fortunate to have a balance sheet that can take advantage of those opportunities as presented. We have an enterprise chassis, if you will, that is built to be bigger and to bolt-on new opportunities and create synergies and value inside of those systems. And so we will continue to look for those as they develop and hopefully find opportunities that make sense for us. Thank you.
A.J. Rice: Great. Thanks.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, A.J.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Let's get one more try Pito.
Pito Chickering: All right. Could you guys hear me now?
Sam Hazen: Yes.
Mark Kimbrough: We can hear you.
Pito Chickering: Take two. All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you give us the components of the 2021 guidance raise? How much is due this strong first quarter? How much it due to additional government funding and any changes to the back half of the year? And as you look at the margins in the back half of the year, you'll face tough comps and good pricing and mix due to COVID. Can you help us walk through the gives and takes are on the assumptions for margins, including the payer mix, circular trends and labor costs?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Pito, so this is Bill. Let me try to zero in on that. As I answered Kevin's, majority was due to the strong performance. We understand we beat our expectations and depending on your number anywhere from $300 million to $400 million that we expected the first half of the year to be stronger than the second half, but it still outpaced our expectations. The sequestration extension for the end of the year is probably worth anywhere from $40 million to $50 million a quarter. So that added – we originally did not anticipate that continuing past the first quarter. So that's an element of the raise, too. So if you look at the midpoint, our raise was $500 million. You could say, it's probably $350 million to $400 million from our performance and then the balance through these government extensions, if you want to have specifics on that. But we also have a range with variables that are – that continue to play out. On the margin question, yes, you're right. And when we gave our year end guidance, we said we anticipate our margins to likely look a lot like the full year 2020, as we began to kind of see the second half of 2020, really with the strength of the payer mix and acuity. So we're very pleased with where we stand with that. We'll continue to evaluate as the year goes on. But I think the balance of our guidance, I reflect back to our discussion at the end of the year. So the raise really is the consideration of the strong performance in the first quarter plus the continuation of the government support.
Sam Hazen: And Bill, this is Sam. Let me add one thing to that. I mentioned just a second ago that, I think we have a differentiated portfolio. And inside of that differentiation, we believe that the growth prospects for Austin, Texas, Dallas, Texas, Miami, Florida, places like that are much better than the national average. And so we continue to see job growth. The other thing, I would point to is that, the increase in enrollment through the exchanges is a very positive dynamic, and we see further opportunities for improvement in that particular dynamic as there's more money supporting navigation and other support for individuals who have lost their jobs. Our participation in exchange product has improved year-over-year and actually significantly improved over two, three, four years to where we have roughly 80% access to exchange lives across HCA markets today, which is quite different than what was maybe three, four years ago. So as more people get enrolled there, we think the support, and this is one of the things we've talked about in the past how does the Affordable Care Act provides support in a recessionary cycle, and it seems to be providing solid support. And as we look forward, that is an area that we find to be a positive dynamic as well.
Mark Kimbrough: Okay. Pito, thank you much. Kara?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Hey, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe: Hey, gents. So outpatient surgery, up 2.3% stands out. Maybe just what's driving that category to kind of buck the negative volume trends? And then I think, Sam, you mentioned 30% on the outpatient side in March. Obviously, that's a pretty hefty number. So just hoping you can give more detail on the categories there and maybe the impact of the influence of weather? I'm assuming some of that may be pulled forward from week of February, but any commentary on that would be helpful? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: All right. Thanks, Ralph. I think, obviously, the March this year had a favorable calendar. We had one more work day than we did last year. Last year, obviously, we shut down the company for the most part, midway through the month. But when we look at our March 2019, we saw activity levels that were consistent on a per business day. So the outpatient surgery activity in March of 2019 per business day was pretty much identical to the outpatient surgical volume per business day in 2021. It's probably a little bit of pull-through from February storms. But for the most part, we were up and operational in a week in the state of Texas, which was a remarkable feat on the part of our teams. And so I don't know exactly how much of that was storm related. It's hard to really pinpoint that. But we're seeing, obviously, a little migration from inpatient to outpatient, which has continued from one year to the next and that's influencing our outpatient statistics also. But when I look broadly across outpatient volumes, not just surgical, cardiac volume, very strong performance in electrophysiology on the cardiac side, recovery in endoscopic procedures on the outpatient side. So some of the diagnostic activity, which we believed had been deferred, it showed itself a little bit in March in ways that we hadn't seen maybe in other months in the latter part of 2020. So we're encouraged by that. As I mentioned in my comments, we're seeing some pull-through into April that’s very similar. And we'll continue to monitor this and report out on it and give you a better feel as we get further into the year.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.
Lance Wilkes: Yes. Thanks a lot. So I just want to ask about two things as we're starting to move into a kind of post-COVID impacted period. Was interested in both what are you able to do from a capacity expansion standpoint kind of within facilities and within outpatient to accommodate more volumes, kind of the catch up on deferred care maybe for the second half of the year to understand how that capacity could expand?  And then just also interested in bad debt, how that's performed during this period? And any activities you've taken as far as kind of collection or other sort of processes to deal with that and how that looks going forward?
Sam Hazen: Okay. Let me take the first one. I'll kick the second one to Bill. I think with respect to capacity management, a couple of things. One, as I mentioned, we're investing to expand capacity where we believe appropriate both inpatient, outpatient, emergency room, whatever the case may be, we have a very sophisticated analytical methodology to determining where we have constraints and where do we have opportunities to relieve those constraints with investments and so forth. But the second thing I would say, and I think this is an important point, and it’s a learning that we experienced during the COVID year, I'll call it, 2020 and the first part of this year. The ability to manage our capacity in order to deal with the different surges that we experienced required us to haul our discharge planning process and case management functions at time to create flexibility with the capacity that we do have. So if we were to see a spike in deferred care starting to show itself, I think the learnings operationally and from a capacity management standpoint, that we experienced and gained during the COVID surges will help us in responding to that particular situation. So those are the two approaches that we're doing to deal with potential growth in demand. And we still continue to believe that long-term health care demand is there. And it will be there in the future and our systems are durable and built for that as we continue to move through these different periods. Bill?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. On the bad debt and the uninsured, I think as we reported in the past, we've continued to see declines in our uninsured volume as the COVID pandemic began to show itself all throughout the last three quarters of last year, and that continues into the first quarter. And those uninsured declines were greater than our total. So some of that is also due to we are receiving some HRSA payments for some reimbursement for uninsured COVID patients. So all of those have resulted that our uncompensated care levels are actually below where we were running prior year. And we don't see any material developing trends in that category. So we're very pleased with where we stand relative to the bad debts and the uncompensated care position.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Lance.
Lance Wilkes: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Hey, Scott.
Scott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a follow-up question actually on just on the home health strategy. I'm interested if you guys had mentioned the interest statistic that you have around 250,000 patients to start annually directly into the home. Interested if you've been able to evaluate what percentage of those patients would be covered by the existing Brookdale Home Health footprint. And then as you think about markets where you have – don't have the overlap with Brookdale, whether you would look to scale up that asset or whether you would consider pursuing additional strategic relationships with other HH [ph] providers? Thanks.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Scott.
Sam Hazen: Yes. Scott, on the Brookdale, roughly 60% to 70% of their agencies have overlap in our markets. So obviously, that was an attractive strategic component of the acquisition. And as we work through the acquisition integration, we're going to explore that even further. Relative to agencies that reside in non-HCA markets, we'll still evaluate what is the appropriate course of action. And if there are partnership opportunities, we may pursue those, but we'll still take that and consider that as we go through the completion of the transaction.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, Scott. Kara?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. I guess my question for you, Sam, as we start seeing this pace of recovery, how are you thinking about remaining pent-up demand in the market? And then as we talked about payer mix earlier, what can you share with us in terms of the mix of patients you're seeing both on the kinds of procedures we're seeing, the recovery in March and April and the payer mix bucket that we're seeing? Is it shifting back to more Medicare, more uninsured, more Medicaid? I just want to see if you can give us some color on what the recovery looks like right now? Thank you.
Mark Kimbrough: All right, Brian. Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Well, I think it's still early to land on exactly what the recovery is looking like. If you look at the two elements of our business where we saw significant drop-off, pediatric activity on one side and then obviously, Medicare activity on the other. So the middle piece, if you want to call it that, is what has been most durable. Having said that, most of our outpatient business that was deferred is that middle piece. Some of the inpatient that we have lost is the outer shoulders, the pediatric and the Medicare side of the equation. So I don't really have a good sense of what's going to happen on the Medicare side. We're starting to see more pediatric activity in the month of March. It wasn't down as much as it was in previous periods, which reflects I think, kids going back to school in many communities, activity starting to happen again with spring sports and such and we're seeing a little bit more traffic in our emergency room related to pediatric volume. But I think on the outpatient side, which is where most of the deferred care, we believe was, that is largely a commercial book of business. 55% of our revenues or so on the outpatient side is commercial-related. And as that starts to develop, we think that will be probably what shows itself from the deferred care. But it's still early. Obviously, there's still uptake with vaccines. There's still concerns with COVID from one community to the other. And all of that could create some choppiness to it all, but we need a few more months to really judge exactly what that rebound is going to be, but we're encouraged again, by March. We're encouraged by the early view into April and we're hopeful that sustains itself over the remainder of this year.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake, Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: Hey, thanks. Good morning.
Mark Kimbrough: Hi, Justin.
Justin Lake: Hey. I’m going to try to squeeze into quota [ph] numbers questions here, if that’s, okay. First, given the meaningful shift in 2021 numbers, obviously, little positive. Wanted to ask about the right jumping off point going in 2022 in terms of moving parts. I mean, obviously, I could think of is just on sequestration is probably going to come back, maybe offset by some acquisition benefits, et cetera. So if you can run through that, that would be great. And then on the commercial mix shift, given how dramatic it's been. I was wondering if you have any ability to parse that out in terms of market share gains versus just the population shift in younger people moving south into your markets. And simply just less deferred care among commercial populations versus maybe Medicare? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Justin, I'll start with the first one. It's early for us to be thinking about the variables going into 2022 as we were just talking about trying to get a read on how the recovery period, if you will or how the business settles once COVID gets to a normalized level. So it's just a little early to think about the puts and takes of 2022. We don't have insight into government funding beyond this year at this stage. So give us another quarter or two. And then as we near the completion of the year, we'll be able to talk to you about our view of the trends we're seeing currently as far as how they roll into 2022.
Sam Hazen: And Justin, this is Sam. On the market share, we are operating at an all-time high on market share based upon the most currently available data we have, which is the end of the third quarter for 2020, and we're pushing the overall market share for the company across the 43 domestic markets into the low 27% zone. So very high watermark. On the commercial side of the equation, we have, in fact, gained market share on the commercial at an even faster pace. I don't know exactly how that's playing out in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter. But we have seen trends that are more positive for our company on that particular front and our overall trends. And I think that's been part of our results. And we continue to evolve our physician strategy, our service line strategies, our outreach strategies and so forth toward the commercial book of business as you would expect, and we believe it's yielding positive results for the company.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Justin.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.
Mark Kimbrough: Hey, Josh.
Josh Raskin: Thanks for taking the question. Just had a quick one on CapEx. It looks like CapEx was actually down almost $200 million year-over-year in the first quarter, even though you are guiding to considerably higher CapEx for the full year? So I was just wondering what caused that decline this quarter. And I wanted to see what the thinking was on how CapEx would ramp through the balance of 2021? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. This is Bill. We understand it was below. Some of that is the capital program starting. We're repopulating the pipeline with approvals. And so the spending of that you didn't see in the first quarter. We still believe that our capital spending will approximate this $3.7 billion, maybe a little bit on either side of that. And so we do anticipate the capital, the actual spend to ramp as we go throughout the year, and we'll just have to continue to evaluate that. So ultimately, I think what you're seeing in the first quarter is as we slowed down capital in 2020, as we began re-implementing some of our capital programs, just the spending didn't occur at that same level. But we still believe 3.7% is the right number here. Just timing on how the capital gets spent.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Josh. Even though, I don't think you are Josh.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James.
John Ransom: Hey. Good morning, team. I have an exciting opportunity for you. I'm going to ask two questions, and you can either answer both the quick ones. We'll catch-up on the other offline. So dealer's choice. So my first question is, if we look at your assumptions for the back half of the year, my hypothesis is that certainly, Medicare will grow faster than commercial, but both buckets, if we measure by adjusted admissions will grow just commercial at a lower rate. Is that consistent with your assumptions? And my second question is what is – what are your top two or three public policy priorities in D.C. given the new administration? I'll stop there. Thank you.
Sam Hazen: Yes. John, let me take the first one. Our assumptions throughout the year just consistent with our year end is that we do expect a recovery of our historical business to return. As we see COVID settle to a level, as we hope broader populations get vaccinated, that we'll begin to see this return. So we do expect some growth to occur from where we are now as we go through the year. And I think that is reflected in our full year guidance. The exact timing and the pacing of that is unclear. But we do expect throughout the year, there will be a recovery, and we'll return to some historical level of pattern for us. And that would likely occur through all payer classes in Medicare as well as the commercial as we've talked about.
Bill Rutherford: And we're going to play both of your cards. So the question around ...
John Ransom: Just like a dream come true through.
Bill Rutherford: Just for you, John, just for you. You should have asked great question. On the public policy front, I think, obviously, we're focused in on health policy. And it's our belief that the Affordable Care Act is providing the support for the country that it was intended to do, and we're hopeful that we can maintain policies that provide that kind of protection for people so they have the coverage and access they need. And then the second area would be around tax policy. Obviously, we're a tax paying healthcare system as compared to many of our competitors who aren't and paying and focusing in on getting to the right tax policy is important to us. Those are the two categories that we're focused on.
John Ransom: Thank you.
Mark Kimbrough: All right, John. Have fun at the golf course.
John Ransom: Not today, my course is closed.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Kimbrough: Hey, Jamie.
Jamie Perse: Hey, good morning. You mentioned the March trends and that continuing into in April. I wanted to clarify, does that mean the volume levels were similar in March and heading into April or that the recovery curve is progressing in April. And then more forward looking, just what leading indicators do you look at, whether it's primary care utilization or non-COVID diagnostic trends that might give us some color on where volumes might go from here?
Sam Hazen: I think for the comment around April is a general observation about our business as a whole. And some of the aspects of our March activity and results is carrying forward into April. That's really all I'm going to say at this particular point in time. What was the second question again?
Mark Kimbrough: Leading indicators?
Sam Hazen: Okay. We use our physician practices as a source of leading indicators, if you will. And we're starting to see new patient activity grow. I want to say, in the month of March, new patient activity, some of this is business day driven was up 17% over the previous year. And that's a pretty significant indicator of future activity. That occurred across a variety of specialties. We employ roughly 7,500 to 8,000 physicians. And so we're seeing activity within new patient rosters and new patient activity show up in our clinics. And as I mentioned also, our emergency room activity has started to grow a little bit from where it was in the low point in 2020 and during the COVID periods. So those are two leading indicators that I would suggest are indicative of maybe more activity starting to percolate in the markets.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Jamie. Kara?
Operator: And there are no more questions at this time.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Well, listen, we want to thank everyone for joining the call today. As always, feel free to call, if there are additional questions that you might have. But have a safe day. Thank you.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-02 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and inductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Good morning, and thank you, Nora. Welcome to everyone on today's call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and CFO, Bill Rutherford. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then we’ll take questions. Before I turn the call over to Bill and Sam, let me remind everyone that should today’s call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management’s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today’s press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning’s call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today’s release. This morning’s call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be made available later today. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning. In the face of the highest surge yet of the COVID-19 pandemic, we finished the year with strong financial results in the fourth quarter. These results were driven once again by highly acute inpatient volumes, coupled with solid cost management. In the quarter, our hospitals provided care to 56,000 COVID-19 inpatients, a 40% increase over the third quarter. Since March, we have delivered care to 122,000 inpatients with the virus, representing 8% of total admissions. Currently, our hospitals continue to treat many patients with COVID-19. Census levels fortunately have begun to decline over the past few weeks. Revenues in the fourth quarter grew by $770 million or 5.7% over the prior year. This increase was driven by growth in inpatient revenues, which were up 12%. Revenue per admission grew 16%, while admits were down 3.4%. As mentioned, the acuity within our inpatient business was higher as reflected in both case mix index, which increased almost 7%, and length of stay, which grew by 6%. Outpatient revenue continued to lag as volume declined across most categories. We attribute many of these declines to the swell in COVID activity we serve, causing many patients to defer care. Outpatient revenues were down 4%. On the cost side, our teams continue to perform well. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the company grew on a year-over-year basis. In the quarter, we experienced some upward pressure on labor costs due to challenges related to nurse staffing, which were caused mostly by demands related to the COVID-19 surge that occurred across most hospitals in the country. With respect to supply costs, we incurred increased drug costs related to the growing utilization of remdesivir and personal protective equipment costs. Diluted earnings per share increased 33.7% in the quarter to $4.13. For the year, diluted earnings per share, excluding losses and gains on sales, as well as losses on debt retirement, grew 10.6% over 2019 to $11.61. Before I provide our outlook on 2021, I want to reflect on 2020. Just like many others, this past year was clearly a remarkable year for HCA Healthcare on multiple fronts. For us, however, I believe it will be seen also as a pivotal year. Across many dimensions, we improved our enterprise capabilities, which should allow us to support our local health systems better and enhance their abilities to provide higher quality care with greater efficiency. More importantly, we demonstrated an organizational ability to respond quickly and effectively to possibly the greatest challenge the company has ever experienced. And now, I believe we are emerging on the backside of this event stronger and better positioned to grow and drive value for our stakeholders. We did this while staying true to our mission throughout the process, and we could not have made these improvements without the unwavering commitment and excellent execution shown by the 285,000 colleagues and 50,000 physicians who make up HCA Healthcare. I want to thank them for their tremendous work, compassion and service to our patients and others in their communities. Currently, our teams are working diligently to vaccinate as many people connected to our health system as possible. To date, we have vaccinated approximately 200,000 colleagues, physicians, first responders and other individuals critical to the delivery of health care services. As we push forward into 2021, our overall outlook for the year remains generally consistent with the early perspectives we provided last quarter. While many aspects of our business, including the impact of the pandemic, remain difficult to predict, we believe the guidance that we are providing today is reasonable. We also believe that, together, our growth plan and capital deployment plan, which was announced in today's earnings release, should enhance long-term shareholder value. Because of the decisive actions we took at the onset of the pandemic and the solid results we produced in 2020, our company is now in a stronger financial position. This strength allows us to deploy sufficient capital resources to both plans while still maintaining ample balance sheet capacity to use for other strategic opportunities that may develop, including acquisitions. As part of our growth plan, we continue to find ways to strengthen our position locally and nationally. Some highlights are as follows. This past year, we acquired a 40% interest in a telemedicine company, which we believe has capabilities that can accelerate our program. We have committed significant capital to develop new and expanded inpatient rehab bed capacity in Florida, which recently eliminated certificate of need requirements certificate of need requirements in this service. And finally we have partnered, in many instances, with marquee physicians across the company to grow programs horizontally and vertically in key services. Our objective is still to be the provider system of choice in the communities we serve. Our strategic approach to accomplishing this goal has two overarching components. First, develop comprehensive health systems locally that deliver high quality, convenient care to our patients and second, support these networks with our unique enterprise capabilities and economies of scale. This blended model supported with strong execution has served us well over the past few years, as market share has reached an all-time high, using the most recently available data. But we are pushing for more. We have constructed a set of strategic initiatives that are underway and designed to deliver a better experience for our patients and improve the company's future performance. These efforts include seeking ways to utilize our network and expand into upstream or downstream business opportunities, including identifying different approaches to optimizing our portfolio of assets, we are investing more in technology to enhance quality outcomes for our patients, advance our operational effectiveness and drive efficiencies. And finally, we are finding ways to capitalize on the diverse footprint that we have by partnering with other companies to accelerate these initiatives. One example of our efforts to partner is the recent announcement we made to invest in a domestic PPE production company, which will be based in Asheville, North Carolina, this entity will supplement other supply chain sources, we have for procuring sufficient PPE for our colleagues. In 2021, we plan to increase our capital spending by approximately $850 million. This step-up is expected to mostly support our growth plans. Additionally, we have approximately $3.3 billion of other growth projects under construction that we expect to be operational this year or next. This pipeline includes capacity expansion projects at various hospitals, two new hospitals and additional outpatient facilities, mainly ambulatory surgery centers, freestanding emergency rooms and physician clinics. To round out our capital plan, our Board of Directors approved reinstating the quarterly dividend at $0.48 per share, while also increasing the authorization for a share buyback program. Bill will provide more details on these items and others in his comments. We are incredibly proud of our colleagues in the company's accomplishments in 2020, which included returning or repaying early over $6 billion of CARES Act funds to the federal government. Our performance this past year, gives us greater confidence to believe that we will be able to navigate successfully through future challenges as well. As we continue to honor our mission, we will remain focused on delivering high quality care to our patients, supporting our colleagues and physicians, responding to the vital role we play in the communities we serve and creating value for our shareholders. And now we'll turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Rutherford: Great, Thank you Sam and good morning, everyone. I'm going to walk through our 2021 guidance, and then touch on our capital allocation plan, including our announcement this morning to reinstate our dividend, and share repurchase program. The 2021 guidance outlined in our release this morning is consistent with our broader commentary, we provide on our third quarter call. We anticipate our inpatient admissions to grow approximately 2% to 4% over 2020, as reported results. And this would equate to about a 1% to 3% below 2019 levels. We expect our outpatient volumes to grow from 2020 levels but to track below 2019 as well. We expect our revenue per equivalent admission to be flat to down slightly with our 2020 level. This is mainly driven by expected declines in COVID activity throughout the year and loss of supplemental COVID funding. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be consistent with our as-reported 2020 full year level and range between 19% and 20%. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is between $10.3 billion and $10.9 for 2021. Earnings per share is expected to range between $12.10 and $13.10 for 2021. Also, we expect interest expense of approximately $1.6 billion and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. I would like to share a couple of other thoughts regarding our 2021 guidance as we think about our 2020 performance and results. The COVID pandemic and the various surges we have seen had a significant effect on our operating results throughout the year. As we have mentioned previously, we expect to continue to serve COVID patients throughout 2021. And while it is difficult to predict how the future cycles of this pandemic will occur, at this point, we anticipate our COVID volume to be heavier in the first half of the year and then hopefully will decline in the second half of the year as broader segments of the population receive a vaccination. We do expect some recovery of demand and deferred volume as the COVID activity lessens. It is difficult to predict the progression of the pandemic during 2021, but we believe our baseline assumptions are reasonable at this point. Let me speak briefly to some cash flow and balance sheet metrics, along with our capital allocation decisions. First, as a result of numerous measures we took in 2020, the cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet position of the company are in a very strong position. We finished 2020 with cash flow from operations of $9.2 billion. After our capital spend of $2.8 billion, the first quarter dividend of $150 million and non-controlling interest distributions of $625 million, our free cash flow was $5.6 billion for the year. Our debt balance declined $2.7 billion from our year-end 2019 levels, and we have approximately $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.0 X at the end of the year after netting out available cash. All of this is after returning or repaying early over $6 billion of provider relief funds and accelerated Medicare payments that we discussed on our third quarter call. Our 2020 cash flow metrics were benefited by deferred payroll taxes of approximately $700 million, which will begin to be repaid in later 2021, as well as great working capital management by our teams. The -- for 2021, we\ anticipate cash flow from operations to range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. As we evaluated our 2021 finance plan and considered our capital allocation strategies, we recognized our current position and outlook for 2021 presents an opportunity to find the optimum balance of investing capital to drive growth, position the balance sheet to execute on strategic M&A opportunities as they may present and returning value to our shareholders through reinstated dividend and share repurchase programs. We entered 2021 positioned to execute on all of these objectives. So as mentioned in our release this morning, our 2021 finance plan calls for the following. We anticipate capital spending to approximate $3.7 billion in 2021. This represents an approximately $850 million increase over 2020. Our Board of Directors declared a $0.48 dividend to be paid in the first quarter. This represents over an 11% increase from the quarterly dividend level that we suspended in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID pandemic. Our Board of Directors also authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program. We had approximately $2.8 billion remaining on our prior authorization. As a result, the company currently has $8.8 billion in total authorization. Consistent with our past programs, we have no defined time period to execute on the share repurchase authorization, but we anticipate executing over the next 12 to 18 months, with the majority expected to be completed in 2021, subject to market conditions. In addition to these actions, we are making an adjustment to our historical leverage target. Since 2013, we've had a stated leverage target to operate at a leverage ratio between 3.5 times and 4.5 times. Given our current leverage position is below that range and with our outlook going forward, we are lowering our expected leverage target to be between three times and four times, and we expect to run at the mid to low end of this range in the foreseeable future. We believe all of these actions represent a balanced capital philosophy that allows the company to continue to invest in our existing facilities to drive growth, position us well to explore strategic acquisitions as they may become available and provides the opportunity to drive long-term value. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark and open it up for Q&A.
Mark Kimbrough: Okay. Thank you, Sam and Bill. Nora, would you give directions on getting into the Q&A and remind everyone, please, to ask one question?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Kevin Fischbeck: Okay. Great. Thanks. I just wanted to get a little bit more color on how you were thinking about, as volumes normalize, how the margins look on that volume returning, just because this year you benefited -- last year, you benefited from higher acuity payer mix benefited as the volumes returned? Is it going to be lower acuity, worse payer mix? How are you thinking about how that all comes together when you think incremental margin, not volume?
Bill Rutherford: Yeah Kevin, this is Bill. Let me take first stab at that. We recognize, we've been running high margins in the last half of the year. And as you stated and as we've said previously, that's largely due to the acuity that we've seen, the higher COVID activity, and a favorable payer mix going forward. We said in my commentary that we expect margins to range between 19% and 20%. The midpoint, obviously, will be 19.5%, which is where we finished full year 2020. We do believe as COVID declines throughout the year and we begin to see return of our historical volumes that, that will settle out. And we see that in our revenue per adjusted admission commentary that I gave as well. So it really is a matter of timing of when that occurs. But as we look forward -- and this year, we've been benefited by the acuity and the payer mix in terms of our commercial volume declines lower than our Medicare volumes, I think that will eventually settle out and return to maybe what our historical norms have been.
Sam Hazen: Let me add to that comment. This is Sam, Kevin. I think one thing, as I mentioned, we're pushing for more with respect to growth. We're also pushing ourselves with respect to resiliency and finding ways again to leverage economies of scale inside of HCA, giving us opportunities possibly to sustain this. That's our management challenge. We're obviously not there yet, but we have opportunities, we believe, inside of our financial resiliency program to advance that initiative. The second thing I would tell you is our investments and our advancing of technology is another opportunity for us to find more profitability within our existing revenue base. We have a lot of variation. We have a lot of opportunities to create more timely decisions and ultimately drive more efficiencies and better patient outcomes. And so technology and economies of scale continue to present opportunities for us to improve profitability across the organization. I don't know exactly where that lands, to Bill's point, but we do see certain initiatives yielding certain value for us over time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Operator: Gary Taylor, your line is open.
Gary Taylor: I'm sorry. Can you hear me now?
Sam Hazen: Yes. Yes, you're good.
Gary Taylor: Okay. I'm sorry. I'm going to ask two questions in case I strike out on the first one. The one I wanted to get after, if, Bill, if you had any comments on just EBITDA progression for the year, whether that looks like sort of what we're used to normal kind of first quarter and fourth quarter being highest. Obviously, I listened to your comments about margin and how COVID might normalize. If I don't get anything on that, I just wanted to ask about on the labor front, if you had any views on how the Biden administration plan to raise the minimum wage, how that might impact you and if any of that was incorporated in the guidance or could be accommodated in the guidance.
Sam Hazen: Okay. Let me -- Gary, this is Sam. I would swing and miss on your first one because, like Bill said, we -- we're trying to judge the pandemic and the implications of the pandemic, and it's been variable as you have seen over 2020, and we expect more variability with it. Our belief is, generally speaking, the latter part of the year will hopefully be a situation where we have a rebound in normal care and that some of the deferral of care, which we know has taken place over the past year, will start to surface in a more noticeable way. With respect to minimum wage, HCA has a living wage policy that had implemented approximately two years ago or actually advanced two years ago where we have different levels of minimum wage established based upon the cost of living. So, for example, in San Jose, California, the cost of living is much greater. Our minimum wage threshold in that particular market would be well north of $15 per hour. But in El Paso, Texas, as an example, it's lower because the cost of living in El Paso, Texas, is much lower than San Jose. And our floor on that program is $12.50 per hour, adjusted again to local market conditions. So we have a number of markets that are above $15 per hour already and others that are approaching it, but our floor for everybody is $12.50. In addition to that, we obviously have to be competitive with the marketplace as it relates to service workers or whatever the case may be. And our competitive wage program and our compensation programs are embedded in that. And in many instances, they are above the floor also. As it relates to a global $15 per hour federal policy on the wages, it's a minimal impact on the company because of the program that we already have in place.
Gary Taylor: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Frank Morgan: Good morning. I'll move away from guidance. Maybe two more detailed questions. Where do you stand today on deferred procedures in light of the surge? And hopefully, that's rolled over now. And are you starting to see any kind of change in the Medicare or any of the government mix now that the surge is starting to roll over nationally, or are you seeing this rollout in the vaccine increasing? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Let me give you some general progression on COVID in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the first two months in the quarter we were ramping up COVID activities. October was the low point. November was higher, and then December was almost 50% of our COVID activity in the quarter. That continued into January, which is even higher census levels for COVID in December. We have proven that we can manage through COVID surges, and I'm immensely proud of our teams and how they've responded to the pressure points from one facility to the other, from one community to the other. And so we continue to manage through that. As part of our management process in responding to the communities in an appropriate way, we have to manage the intake process with respect to transfers into our facilities at times and elective care at times. Those are dialed up, dialed down as needed. And we've told our teams that we expect you to manage that activity conservatively so that we can respond to people in need whenever they need our services. And that's been our approach. So during December and also January, we had to manage down the intake into our facility so that we could deal with the COVID surge that we were experiencing. We have relaxed that over the course of the first part of this year as our census levels, as I mentioned in my comments have declined over the past few weeks. And it's too early, Frank, to know exactly what the recovery is going to be within Medicare population or other services and so forth. And we will just have to wait and see exactly how that plays out. But to Bill's point, we expect the first part of the year to be still more COVID activity than the last half. And the last part of the year to be, hopefully, a recovery in the certain levels of deferred care that, again, we know has taken place.
Frank Morgan: Any way to measure that deferred volume?
Sam Hazen: No. No.
Operator: Next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just -- I want to just piggyback off of some of the comments that Sam and Bill made during their prepared remarks, expressed some interest, Sam, I think in looking at upstream and downstream opportunities. I know we mentioned the Florida Rehab opportunity. Just trying to understand exactly what you're talking about there. I know people are talking about things like behavioral on the downstream might be of interest on upstream. I don't know whether you're referring to maybe even start to think about taken some risk or what that involves? But -- and Bill mentioned strategic deals, usually when you talk about strategic deals being a possibility, that's bigger than a one-off hospital. So I think when I think about capital deployment, I'm wondering what you guys are talking about, if you could flush it out a little more when you're referencing those types of upstream, downstream and strategic deal opportunities?
Sam Hazen: A.J., this is Sam. Let me give you some sense of how we're thinking about our provider system. It's not necessarily a new thought, but it's one that we have advanced over the course of this year. Our provider system model, which we like to term the HCA flywheel, it's been very consistent in how we think about it, how we plan, how we resource and how we hold ourselves accountable over the past decade, has served us incredibly well, as I mentioned in our comments. And we have challenged ourselves to understand what else is available to us as a result of that flywheel in that system. And we believe that – and we've proven it in certain categories. We have as a classic example in markets where we didn't have certificate of need that we have been able to integrate that service. When a patient needs rehab, we've been able to internalize that patient in our system and deliver value for the patient and value for our system as we build out that service line. We see other opportunities in post-acute in certain markets and maybe even beyond certain markets. We see opportunities again in behavioral health where we have delivered value in that category. It's not really post-acute, but again, it's connected to our system. A lot of our patients have behavioral health needs, many of which we can take care of, but there are opportunities for us to add programs and add capacity in some markets to deal with some of the mental health challenges that exist across the country. With respect to upstream, where we see opportunities is with telemedicine. We see a lot of opportunities upstream with telemedicine. Obviously, it's creating a new access point for patients as they interact with telemedicine and physician offices, but we also see inside of telemedicine other value chains that exist within that particular platform. And again, we took an interest in what we believe to be an incredibly well-run organization that has already done some work with HCA, but we see opportunities to use our footprint their capability to create a better solution for telemedicine. We think that can enhance delivery of in-hospital medicine with better physician coverage, more efficient physician coverage and ultimately better outcomes for our patients. So we see a value there. And for many of our physicians, we see an opportunity to attach them to this telemedicine platform and create an opportunity for them to be a service to other non-HCA facilities. So that's an example of telemedicine that we were approaching. With respect to strategic opportunities, I think people don't fully understand how many different components we have inside of HCA Healthcare. There are clearly a portfolio of services, of markets and facility types. And when we look inside of our portfolio of offerings, we see opportunities to create more strategic value with aspects of our portfolio that are outside of the normal hospital. We see opportunities to create new strategic relationships with other entities that we believe can help us accelerate our initiatives, and we, at the same time, accelerate their position, so strategic partnerships are available to us. We learned a lot about that during COVID. And then finally, we have opportunities, we believe, to create financial value with certain transactions because these assets are potentially worth more outside of HCA than they are inside of HCA. And if we can secure strategic value or a certain relationship that allow us to accelerate our initiatives, there may be opportunities for us to co-venture or something else even with those assets. So that's what we're referring to. We have a number of initiatives and analyses underway. I don't know exactly where all of those are going to land, but that's what we're talking about.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Joshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe explain a little bit on that last question around risk, but are you starting to see any impact of physician alignment with payers and sort of other large MSOs? And thinking about markets like South Florida, maybe Texas for you. Is this just more of a Medicare Advantage phenomenon? Are you seeing some impact in the commercial segment? Are you being presented of opportunities to take risk?
Sam Hazen: Well, let me speak to physician alignment in general. I think that is our wheelhouse. We are a very physician-friendly, customer-oriented organization with respect to physicians. We have almost 50,000 physicians who are affiliated with HCA in some form or fashion. Some of those relationships are through MSO relationships. Some of those relationships are, as it relates to institutional providers when the physicians are taking risk. Our fundamental approach to physicians are to give them voice inside of HCA, to make sure we have the clinical capabilities, nursing, technology, subspecialty support that they need, number two; number three, to be efficient in taking care of their patients; and then number four is to prove to them that we can help them grow their practice. That's been our model. That will continue to be our model in the future. And we believe that's a winning formula when executed at a detailed level. As it relates to certain opportunities with risk, we do have some of our physicians taking risk in certain specialties or certain categories. That's not large scale across our organization, but it does happen. As we think about the future and managed care relationships, I will tell you, we have advanced our payer relationships. We're roughly 90% contracted for 2021, over 50% contracted for 2022, again, continuing at similar trends to the past few years. We have structurally advanced our relationships with HICS payers this past year. We're in a much better position with HICS access. And as the Biden administration continues to push on the Affordable Care Act as the solution for uninsured, which we believe is the right solution, we should be in a strong position as a result of the improvements in contracting. So managed care is not a one-size-fits-all for 43 different markets. Healthcare is still local at some level. We think we're advantaged because of national capabilities within our local systems and we will adjust to each market condition appropriately to deal with risk relationships, other type of relationships needed in order to drive value for our organization. Most of the risk, to your question, is in Medicare Advantage. It hasn't spilled over in any significant way to commercial. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Pito Chickering: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. On capital deployment, I understand the 3 to 4 range that you're guiding for and that you're running at the midpoint to low end of that range. So a multipart question. Is it safe to assume that all free cash flows will be going to share repos, and if EBITDA grows that you'll lever up to maintain those ratios? Will you get investment great credit if you're on at the low 3s on leverage? And how much share repo is assumed in the 2021 guidance?
Bill Rutherford: Pito, thank you. Pito, this is Bill. Thank you. Yes. At a current level, you could probably assume most, if not all, of our free cash flow will be dedicated to share repurchase. But as we've said, we have ample capital capacity ending the year, both in terms of cash on the balance sheet, as well as access to our short-term revolvers and bank commitments on there. So we've got capacity to execute, as I said, on the majority of the share repurchase, and then we'll evaluate the market conditions as they present to fine-tune the cadence of that. As we said, we believe lowering the leverage ratio is the right thing to do given where we are today and what our outlook is. And we do anticipate running at the mid to low end of that as we execute on all of our capital philosophies. And I think that leaves us in a very strong position to pursue any acquisitions that may present themselves, as Sam talked about. So I think all of those are part of our comprehensive plan.
Pito Chickering: So just a sort follow-up, how much share repo do you assume in your 2021 EPS guidance? And do you think you guys can get to intonate credit at this current leverage ratio?
Sam Hazen: Yes. Thanks. So our range in our EPS guidance provides accommodation that we can accomplish and will accomplish the majority of our share repurchase program. In terms of investment-grade rating, we're just going to have to continue our positive discussions with the rating agencies. As you know, our secured credit facilities are already at the investment grade. In terms of getting the whole company upgrade, we'll just have to wait to see. I think to wait to see. I think the agencies are expecting us to state a range and commit to that area, and we'll have to see how they evaluate it relative to investment grade going forward. What I can tell you is, we have ample access to the market and we believe at reasonable rates. And so we're generally comfortable with our position today.
Bill Rutherford:  Hey Pito, in the earnings release this morning, there is a supplemental non-GAAP disclosure on the guidance piece, which gives you the weighted average shares for the year. So you can kind of use that as your starting point, understanding that share repo will take place throughout the year, obviously, and that's a weighted number.
Pito Chickering: Great. Thank you so much guys.
Operator: Next question is from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Your line is open.
Scott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning
Scott Fidel: Interested if within the 2021 guidance, obviously, there's a lot of impact from mix around the revenues per adjusted admission. So just would be interested if you could walk us through maybe the average underlying rate update assumptions that you're thinking about for commercial, Medicare and Medicaid? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yeah. Scott, there's always a lot of variables in that. As Sam mentioned, we've got good visibility into our commercial contracting at comparable rates have been. Our Medicare rates probably is in that 1% to 2% level as we've seen going forward, maybe a little north of that, depending on how some of the specifics fall out. The rest of our acuity is going to be impacted just by the decline in COVID, as we've talked about, that's brought a higher acuity. And then we do receive some supplemental funding for COVID, the DRG add-ons and some of the versa and some of the other things that may have delayed some sequestration cuts that we don't anticipate continuing throughout the entire year. So, all of those are our factors, when we talk about our revenue per equivalent admission discussion. I'll also say that, if we hold where we are in 2020, it still represents about a 10% growth where we finished 2019. So we think our estimates are reasonable at this point.
Operator: Your next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi Bank. Your line is open.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to -- Hey. I just want to go back to the labor side of things. I thought you managed it pretty well, but your commentary suggests greater pressure. So just hoping you can give us a little more detail on sort of wage growth, turnover competition and maybe what you've embedded into guidance for 2021 and maybe just how the acquisition or investment in Galen perhaps is that line item? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. Yeah. In my comments, I was referring to the fourth quarter vis-à-vis the third quarter as it related to the marketplace and some of the dynamics of the marketplace with, specifically for nursing, but secondarily, even for respiratory therapists. Obviously, when the whole country is in a respiratory distressed mode, because of the COVID surge that was occurring on a broad-based level, it put pressure on nursing. There were opportunities for nurses to go from one community to the other as it related to travelers and special pay programs and all that kind of stuff. So we were seeing a bit of velocity inside of our flexible staffing categories that we hadn't seen before and that required us to respond and so we did experience cost per FTE pressure in the fourth quarter that we didn't have in the third quarter and the surges that occurred more recently then. As we think about of 2021, we have advanced our cost per FTE assumptions somewhat, and we expect the marketplace to be a little bit more advanced than it has been historically. We think that will moderate as COVID moderates, because of the fact that there will be less sort of national demand for nurses across the country as COVID moderates over the course of the year. We do believe we have a robust agenda. We have to execute on that agenda. That includes better retention. That includes better recruitment and sourcing. And it also includes advancing our Galen strategy. We acquired Galen at the beginning of 2020. We have been limited in our ability to expand it because of the Department of Labor requirements where it imposed upon us a one-year moratorium on expansion. We have an expansion strategy that we will execute over the next two to three years, and we think that will create the continuum of nursing education that we want that will solidify our sourcing and training of nurses on the front end and then coupled with the clinical education programs that we've advanced over the past few years. Once a nurse is in our system, we can continue to develop their skill sets, their competency, their confidence and hopefully create an environment where nurses feel that they can be even more successful inside of an HCA facility.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Got a couple of numbers questions here. First, you guided to about 5% revenue and EBITDA growth at the midpoint year-over-year, but you mentioned 2% to 4% volume and flat pricing and margins. So I'm wondering if I'm missing something here in the components to get to 5% versus that, call it, 3%. And then you did a great job of managing costs in a tough 2020 environment. I'm just curious, how much flexibility do you think you still have here into 2021 given the uncertainty you talked about around volume and acuity and payer mix. Thanks.
BillRutherford: Yeah. Justin, that volume was on the inpatient admissions, and we do anticipate recovery of the outpatient volume and revenue. So I would tell you that our revenue expectation is more in that 4% to 6%. And that, I think, lines up more with the mid-point of where our expectations are in terms of the EBITDA range. So I think it lines up pretty well, and we can talk further about that. In terms of room and the management costs we've talked about before of our resiliency plans. And as Sam mentioned in his commentary, we continue to search for every way we can to improve efficiencies out there. We are well into our stage two of our resiliency plans that are looking at longer term impacts, whether it be how do we use technology, automation is an example of some initiatives that we have going on that front. We have initiatives around support structures that we have throughout the organization. We have some call center discussions and optimization efforts. And we have a whole host of what I would call Stage 2 resiliency that we are going to continue to focus on and execute throughout 2021. And I think that can provide upside and protect a little bit buffers if we continue to see some upward pressure on the labor cost. So we do see continued opportunity for efficiency gains within HCA in a lot of our areas. Our supply chain teams continue to find opportunities to improve supply chain and utilization. Our revenue cycle teams as well as a host of other efforts going around the support structure of the enterprise.
Justin Lake: Thanks, Bill. Can I just follow up with the…
Bill Rutherford: Sure.
Justin Lake: Can you give us a view on adjusted admissions then for 2021 that you built in the guidance that would include the outpatient?
Bill Rutherford: Yeah. So that would be more in that 4% – 3% to 5% level.
Justin Lake: Okay, perfect. Thanks for the help.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line from Whit Mayo with UBS. Your line is open.
Whit Mayo: Hey. Thanks. I was just looking at the ER numbers, and I don't think the trends are terribly surprising to many of us, but I'm just curious how you're thinking about the ED, maybe not this year, but next year, and maybe more specifically, how you're reorienting how you manage the ED for the lower volumes. I just have to imagine there's some fundamental changes you guys are thinking about in terms of how you approach the ER moving forward.
Sam Hazen: Whit, let me speak to that. I think just as our inpatient population of patients this year is more acute, our emergency room population of patients is more acute. We have seen less declines in our upper level acuity categories for emergency room patients than we've seen in previous years. We have lost some lower acuity business. Of the total business that we lost, almost 70% of our declines have been in uninsured patients or Medicaid patients. So it's been interesting to me that the payer mix on a relative basis is actually slightly better, even though all categories are down. And then within the categories, it's more acute. As a company, I will tell you, we have sufficient ER supply beds at this particular juncture. We do have some pocketed opportunities, as I mentioned in my call -- my comments rather, around certain freestanding emergency rooms in certain markets where we see opportunities to serve the community better. And we will push on those. I think, today, we have roughly 125 or 130 freestanding ERs. We'll add another 12 to 15 over the next year or so. And those are very strategic with respect to certain markets. The emergency room is a very important component of our system, and it will remain that for really high-end care, trauma, burn, stroke, cardiac and so forth. Our patient satisfaction, it has been stable this year. It's been a difficult year in the emergency room. Our throughput continues to be reasonable, given some of the pressures we've seen with the acuity of patients. So we continue to be optimistic about the purpose and the role that our emergency rooms play to our system, but we have seen some change in overall mix, and that will put downward pressure on capital needs that we had historically, and we'll be able to utilize those capital capacity for other strategic opportunities or other components of our programs as we move through the next few years.
Bill Rutherford: Hey, Mark, let me correct something I said with Justin's question. Our AA guidance would be more four to six. I misspoke saying three to five. So I want to correct that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Lance Wilkes: A little bit about how you're looking at drug costs and revenues going forward and I'm particularly thinking at three points. One would be, policy and transparency sort of risks or headwinds those might present. Second would be, sourcing initiatives you may have underway. And the third might be, opportunities you see, whether its adding capabilities, et cetera. I appreciate it.
Bill Rutherford: Yeah. I missed the first part of that question, but it was regarding -- around drug costs and revenue and opportunities that we have. So our HPG teams do a great job in the sourcing of our pharmaceuticals, and I think that was clearly evident as we navigated the challenges of 2020. We actually have several initiatives going on around pharmacy procurement and sourcing of that. And so that's ongoing. We continue to work with our clinical teams as we have pharmacy optimization through our efforts as we've, over the years, consolidated a lot of our pharmacy supply chain. So we continue to see opportunity to advance in the supply chain of that. I don't really see material changes on the revenue side relative to pharmaceutical cost given what our Medicare reimbursement structures are as well as some of our commercial side. We are optimistic that there's going to be some revenue support of some of these COVID drugs that we've seen increased utilization, as Sam mentioned, the use of Remdesivir in his comments. And so I think it's pretty much fairly stable in that environment for us. Relative to transparency question on the pharmaceutical costs, we'll have to see. We have other price transparency. I'm not just sure if your question went in there that we continue to work on complying with the federal price transparency regulations and posting through those. But in terms of drug cost transparency, I don't see that having much of an impact on us going forward.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Good morning guys and congrats. Sam or – I guess I'll ask about the CapEx, right? I mean, it's up $850 million year-over-year. You're already spending an elevated amount of CapEx prior to this. So you called out ASCs and freestanding decent, among others. But how are we thinking about your long-term strategy in terms of continuing to ramp up CapEx? And then is there a goal in terms of kind of like penetration on freestanding EDs and ASCs in terms of number of units or percentage contribution that you said? And I guess last part is, from a returns perspective, how long do you normally see the investments before they yield in terms of growth or hitting your internal metrics?
Sam Hazen: All right, Brian. Let me see if we can hatch that one out for you.
Brian Tanquilut: Sorry about that.
Sam Hazen: Let me speak generally to capital expenditures and where we are at this particular juncture, and then Bill can speak to the returns and how we analyze our capital spending from that standpoint. We are increasing our capital spending from 2020 level. We spent about $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion this past year. We're going to approximately $3.7 billion. We believe, as I mentioned in my comments, that a lot of this increase is going to some of our growth plan initiatives that we have. I think one thing that's very important to HCA Healthcare, and I hope you all appreciate and understand, is that we have a unique portfolio of markets that we serve. And when we look and score objectively the HCA markets that we serve compared to the national average with respect to certain economic indicators, roughly 2/3 of our portfolio of top markets outperforms, and in many instances, outperforms the national averages as far as forecast very significantly. So we still have growth opportunities embedded in our portfolio. That's the first thing I would tell you. Secondly, we are investing in our outpatient facility development. A reasonable point of reference is roughly every 1 of HCA's hospitals has 10 to 12 outpatient facilities attached to it. That's not exactly symmetrical from one institution, but when you look at the total outpatient facility network capabilities we have, it's roughly 2,200 to 2,500 outpatient facilities on top of 185 hospitals. So, it's roughly 10 to 12x the number of hospitals. We will continue to build on that because we believe that our patients deserve a convenient offering of facilities in our network. That doesn't require, fortunately, as much capital as the in-patient components of our spending. On the in-patient side, we have a handful of projects out there that we felt still made sense. Most of them are in these high-growth markets; Dallas, Texas; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida, places like that, that are on par with respect to demographic changes that appear to be occurring across the company. We don't want to miss those opportunities. Fortunately, a lot of our investments are long-lived assets and we're in a situation where some of the historical capacity that we put into the market will serve us well in the future. And then as we look at what's already in the pipeline, the $3.3 billion that I referred to, those are going to supplement our capacity. And then by then, hopefully, we're starting to get better visibility into what's happening with demand, and then we can adjust accordingly. So, at this particular point in time, we're not giving any additional long-term guidance on CapEx, but we believe we're in the zone of what we need in the near term to be responsive to the marketplace, competitive, provides the patient safe environment that we want, and ultimately, achieve our overall objectives. So, Bill, you want to speak too?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. I'll just mention briefly, I think for all of you following us, you know we have a very robust process for vetting and evaluating and validating assumptions in our growth capital projects that Sam talked about. In addition, we've got a very robust process where we do retrospective analysis after those projects have been completed and come online to evaluate our assumptions. And really, I think, to take away those retrospective assessments say that we achieve the majority a very high percentage of our returns. So, we're very confident in the assumptions that we use. In terms of time frame for returns, each project is a little bit differently, as might imagine. So, your out-patient, maybe your freestanding EDs, the returns come very quickly. Your new hospitals are maybe longer term returns and long-lived assets. Many times, your expansion projects on a hospital campus are dealing with pent-up demand. So, we can -- once we get through the construction and the opening, those returns come in a reasonable level. So, each project is a little bit different, but we have a really strong process to evaluating our assumptions and taking those into account as we approve projects going.
Sam Hazen: And let me just add to that. Even on our acquisitions, I think we had a strong year with respect to the company's acquisitions. So, the portfolio of acquisitions we have done over the past three or four years was solidly accretive. The margins continue to grow. They're into the low double-digits at this particular point. Our tax-exempt assets that we acquired in Savannah and North Carolina are ahead of models. And then we have a host of other outpatient acquisitions that we've integrated effectively. So, here, again, to Bill's point, we're doing retrospective analysis on our organic growth capital. And then at the same time, we're studying what's worked well and what hasn't worked well with our acquisition portfolio and continuing to refine that in a way that I think is very productive for the company. As we think about acquisitions, the point Bill made in his comments, we've created balance sheet capacity for that. We think -- we don't know when, that there's going to be nice opportunities for us to capitalize on that balance sheet capacity and build out more capabilities across the company. So we will be very opportunistic with respect to that given the position of the balance sheet and the performance and the confidence, we've gained with respect to our acquisition integration.
Operator: All right. Your last question comes from the line of Jamie Perse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jamie Perse: Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on your inpatient and outpatient guidance for the year, you talked about that being below 2019 levels. I'm curious in the back half of the year, fourth quarter you're anticipating getting back closer to flat or even growth. And then any breakdown by medical or surgical, the cadence you're expecting throughout the year in that recovery? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yeah. This is Bill. As we said, we do anticipate as the COVID volumes decline, that will start to see return of our historical volume and maybe capture some of that pent-up demand. So, many variables at this point. It's hard to call and give you specifics in terms of timing of the year. Obviously, we have some comparable issues as we go through the last half of 2020 versus 2021. So we'll have to see that plays. But generally speaking, our broad commentary early on says that we expect our volume to recover, but still run slightly below 2019 level.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Jamie. Nora, I think we're finished here. Listen, we want to thank everyone for participating on today's call. As always, feel free to reach out and contact me, if you have further questions. Thank you so much. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Third Quarter 2020 Earning Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and instructions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Kimbrough: Okay. Thank you, Julianne, and good morning. Welcome to everyone on today’s call. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; our CFO, Bill Rutherford, along with our CMO, Dr. Jon Perlin. Sam and Bill will provide some prepared remarks and then will take questions. Bill will start with some comments on the quarter and then Sam will provide some thought or commentary around some observations that we’re making today. Before I turn the call over to Bill and Sam, let me remind everyone that should today’s call containing any forward-looking statements, they are based on management’s current expectations. Numerous risk and uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today’s press release and our various SEC filings. On this morning’s call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is included in today’s release. This morning’s call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be made available later today. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I’ll provide some additional information on the quarter. You will note in our earnings release this morning, our reported adjusted EBITDA was slightly better than our preview. So, let me highlight some volume indicators and trends. Our same facility admissions declined 3.8% in the quarter. Within this, our Medicare admissions declined 7.6% from the prior year period, and our managed care admissions declined 0.7% from the prior year period. Our same facility admissions declined 3.7% in July, 5.2% in August, and 2.6% in September. Thus far in October, we’ve seen continued improvement in our admission trend. The COVID increases we saw in the quarter began in July and stayed elevated for most of August. Due to this and as we have mentioned in previous settings, we voluntarily suspended elective procedures in over 100 of our hospitals for some period of time during the July and August surges. And this impacted, our surgical volume statistics. Same facility in-patient surgeries declined 6.8% in the quarter from the prior year period. They were down about 11% in July, down about 9% in August and were within 1% of prior year levels in September. Same facility hospital-based outpatient surgeries declined 7.5% in the quarter from the prior year period with about 12% decline in both, July and August, but September saw some growth over prior year. Our ambulatory surgery center volume had a similar result with a decline of 4.7% for the quarter occurred, which occurred primarily in July and August, while September’s volume was about 1% over prior year. The surgical volume results were influenced by business of surgical days in any given month and September did have one more surgical day than the prior year. But, we wanted to share some of the results we saw throughout the quarter to highlight the impact of our voluntary suspension of the elective procedures. Emergency room visits trends were consistent throughout the quarter, which declined 20.3% from the prior year period. Our level 1 and 3 visits declined about 29% and our level 4 and 5 visits declined about 14%. Admissions to the emergency room were down about 2.5%. The higher acuity and revenue intensity results we saw in the quarter offset the impact of these volume declines. Our same facility net revenue per adjusted admission increased 14.8% in the quarter compared to the prior year period. There were three factors that contributed to this result. One is a level of COVID-19 patients we served in the quarter. As we previously mentioned, we served close to 40,000 inpatient COVID cases in the quarter or about 8% of our total admissions. These patients have a higher acuity than average and a longer length of stay, which resulted in a higher consumption of resources. Due to this, revenue per admission is a little bit higher than our average. Second, within our non-COVID patients, we saw a higher acuity patient as those patients presenting for service have been in higher acuity areas such as neurology, cardiology, and oncology and the lower acute services were slower to return. Our non-COVID case mix index increased approximately 5% over the prior year. Lastly, as we mentioned earlier, our maintenance care mix of inpatients as our Medicare volume was slightly slower to recover. Our teams continue to do an excellent job managing our cost structure during these pandemic cycles, which benefited our performance in the quarter, and our labor, supply and other operating costs as a percent of revenue, all showed improvement as compared to the prior year period. Before I conclude, let me speak briefly to some cash flow balance sheet and liquidity metrics. As we mentioned in our earlier calls, the Company took a number of measures early in this pandemic to enhance our operational and financial flexibility. Because of these actions and other factors, we were able to announce that we will return or repay early $6 billion of CARES Act funding, including $4.4 billion of accelerated Medicare payments, and $1.6 billion of provider relief funds we have received. We are working with various government agencies to execute these payments. We expect to fund the entire amount from available cash in future cash flow from operations. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had approximately $6.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet and $7.7 billion of capacity under our credit facilities. Our debt to EBITDA leverage was 2.67 times as of September 30, 2020, after netting out available cash. Cash flow from operations was $2.7 billion for the quarter, which includes the effect of approximately $300 million of stimulus payments that will be part of our repayment. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $12.8 billion, which includes approximately $6.1 billion of government stimulus funds. Also, as mentioned in last quarter’s call, we have reduced the Company’s planned capital expenditures and anticipate our full year 2020 capital spending to be about $3 billion. In short, we believe even after considering the plan returns $6 billion of CARES Act funding, the cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet position of the Company provides us the financial capability and flexibility to navigate these unprecedented times, and we will continue to look for opportunities to create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning. The disciplined operating culture of HCA Healthcare, and the ability to take full advantage of what our size and enterprise capabilities have to offer have produced remarkable performance for the Company this year. These attributes, along with the great people we have in our organization, and the steadfast commitment we have to our mission have allowed us to deliver value consistently and at high levels for all of our stakeholders. As demonstrated again in this quarter’s results, we continue to show resiliency, both operationally and financially, while also enhancing our overall position across the communities we serve. For the past couple of years, we’ve used the third quarter’s earnings call to provide some early thoughts about the upcoming year. In those years, we obviously had a more stable environment, economically, politically and operationally. While always difficult to predict our business with precision, today’s environment with all of its uncertainty makes it particularly challenging. We plan to provide you with more details in January, when we complete our planning process for 2021. By that time, we will have a few more months of experience that we can hopefully use to give a better indication of our thoughts regarding certain components of our business. With that being said, we’re beginning to formulate some preliminary perspectives around a few aspects of our business. And I want to share those with you this morning. With respect to volume, given the unusual volatility we’ve seen in 2020 with COVID-19 surges, mandatory and voluntary suspension of elected business and intermittent recovery periods, we currently plan to use 2019 volumes as a starting reference point for early 2021 planning purposes. Since the pandemic began, we have had very few months, mainly September and October that we believe are indicative of somewhat stable activity. Notwithstanding, we have some observations from these two months, and we are using them to inform our current thinking. First, we believe, we will continue to treat COVID-19 patients throughout 2021. Over the last two quarters, COVID-19 patients have represented approximately 6% of our admissions. Recognizing that there are many variables that could affect next year, at this point, we believe it is reasonable to estimate around 4% to 5% of our 2021 admissions could be related to the virus. This factor suggests continued high levels of acuity in our overall mix of inpatient business, which should provide some support for current inpatient revenue trends. It is difficult however to know if the various governmental reimbursement programs for providing care to COVID-19 patients will continue through 2021. Overall, we believe demand for inpatient admissions next year will be down from 2019, approximately 2% to 3%, but again, with the mix being more acute. On the outpatient side, as compared to 2019, we anticipate emergency room visits will be down in 2021, similar to this year. But like our inpatient business, we expect it to be more acute, which should drive higher revenue per visit, offsetting some of the volume decline. For outpatient surgeries, we are expecting some recovery over current levels, but we expect volumes to be down slightly. With respect to managing operating costs, which has been a key part of our solid results this year, we have continued confidence in our team’s ability to hold many of the gains they have made across the different expense categories. In those areas where we anticipate some pressure, we believe we have future resiliency actions that can help offset some of these challenges. Collectively, these factors lead us to think that our preliminary expectations for adjusted EBITDA for 2021 could look similar to the Company’s original 2020 guidance, but likely with a slightly wider range of results. Clearly, there are additional factors that could influence these perspectives and expectations, including but not limited to, the economy could worsen and impact payer mix, the election result to bring adverse changes to healthcare policies, and the pandemic could fluctuate or affect our results in ways that we cannot anticipate. We will evolve our thinking accordingly as we gain a better understanding of these factors. We believe as I stated in my comments a few weeks ago that we have proven we can meet the challenge of this pandemic. We also believe the Company will be able to navigate successfully through future challenges as well. Since the onset of this historic event, we have improved many clinical, operational, technology and organizational capabilities. We believe these improvements coupled with the financial flexibility we possess, should provide us with a platform to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. Once again, I want to thank our colleagues and our physicians for their incredible work during this year. We are fortunate to have such capable people in our organization. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Mark for questions. Thank you.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Sam, thank you, Bill. Julianne, we’re ready for questions, now if you’ll provide information on the queue, and instructions. And let’s please keep your questions to one, so we may hear as many people into the queue as possible. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Whit Mayo from UBS. Please go ahead.
Whit Mayo: Thanks. I just wanted to -- I got actually two-part question. I just want to be clear on the message for 2021. I appreciate all the details. Just the current thinking is admissions down 2% to 3% in 2019 versus -- I’m sorry, in 2021 versus the 2019 baseline. And also just wanted to build on the wanted to build on the $3 billion that you’re spending on capital this year, it implies kind of a step-up in the first -- in the fourth quarter up to about $1 billion. Is that a good run rate to think about next year? Just was wondering if there’s any comments on 2021. Thanks.
Mark Kimbrough: Sam?
Sam Hazen: So, on the admission estimation, that’s our best thinking at this particular point in time with, we are believing based upon September and October and maybe even June, to some degree that we will not see some of the lesser acute inpatient admissions that we had seen in previous years, but we will continue to see acute -- more acute type patients who need significant care throughout 2021, just as we’ve seen in many months this year as we’ve gone through this COVID period. So, that’s our thinking. Obviously, as we get deeper into the fourth quarter, we’re hopeful that we’ll have months that are reflective enough of what we’ll call stable activity that will allow us to inform that thinking even further. And if we have adjustments to that thinking, we will clearly update you in our fourth quarter call in January.
Mark Kimbrough: Bill, do you want to talk to capital?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. On capital, as you know, our fourth quarter typically runs a little bit higher. I don’t necessarily think the fourth quarter alone is indicative of go-forward run rate. We’re obviously in the ‘21 planning and we’ll finalize our capital expectations. I think, it likely will land somewhere north of where we are in 2020 but less than what our original historical spend was for this year. So, we’ll give you some detail as we get into next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Pito Chickering: Back on the 2021 EBITDA guidance assumptions for a minute. You talked about sort of the volume trends a little soft than 2019 levels but at higher acuity. Can you let us know what payer mix you’re assuming in the guidance, how it differs versus what you saw in the third quarter? And if you dig into the margin side, you saw some pretty good margin leverage on OpEx this quarter. Can you walk us through what assumptions you’re making on salaries and benefits, and OpEx within that guidance?
Sam Hazen: We don’t have those details at this particular point in time to share, Pito. We need to finish our planning process as we typically do in the fourth quarter. We’re trying to give you some general sense of where we see things. There’s obviously puts and takes on every line item on our income statement as always. And as we get further into the fourth quarter and refine our thinking on each of those categories, we’ll give you some range of expectations around those metrics in our planning process in our fourth quarter earnings release.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Taylor from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Gary Taylor: Two-part question as well. One, Bill, wondered, if you could tell us 2019, what emergency room was as a percent of either total revenue or total outpatient revenue, just so we can sort of think about the headwind that you’ve baked in there. And then, the other part is, I guess, clearly, we’ve seen that the worst financial result for HCA comes from when the facilities are empty because you’ve deferred surgical business, and there wasn’t COVID. Now, you’re managing much better sort of simultaneously the COVID ebbs and flows with your surgical business. So, the question is, as investors look forward, as COVID cases increases, do we think that’s a positive or negative for EBITDA, or do we think that still just allows you to manage your overall EBITDA trajectory in a fairly tight range?
Sam Hazen: Let me answer a couple of questions here, Gary, and then I’ll hand it over to Bill. I think, it’s important to understand that two-thirds, two-thirds of our ER visit decline in the third quarter was either uninsured patients or Medicaid. And the balance of our visits were patients who were more acute, as one would expect, and that they delayed possibly or deferred care and were more sick when they came to the emergency room. So, I think it’s a very important element of our ER business. We don’t know exactly how that’s going to play out, but that has been the pattern throughout most of the pandemic. So, Bill, do you want to answer the other question?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. On the COVID, as you’ve identified, volume will fluctuate. It’s hard to isolate that population by itself, if you will, because as we mentioned and intended to highlight in our trends, it also has an impact on some of them were elective as it fluctuates. But, we think we’ll have a level of COVID patients that we’re going to serve throughout 2021, as Sam mentioned in his comments. And I think we’re prepared to manage through those fluctuations as they present.
Operator: Your next question comes from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
A.J. Rice: Just one point of clarification, and then a question. One, so, you’re saying the guidance you gave coming into the year for EBITDA sort of is general range, maybe a little wider. I’ve got various data points, but I just want to make sure I’m looking at the right number. I had $10.25 billion to $10.65 billion was your original guidance. And then, for the question, I guess, I’d just ask, you mentioned future resiliency actions that could be taken as some of the other cost reductions or other aspects of the business, the benefits you’ve seen in the second half here fade a little bit. Maybe expand a little bit on that and how significant are those opportunities as you look out into next year.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. A.J., first, on your first one, yes, I’ll confirm your numbers are correct from what our original 2020 guidance was.
Sam Hazen: And then, A.J., on the question around future resiliency, Bill is leading this effort, but I want to give you some strategic approach that we’re taking because we believe that there are significant opportunities inside of the approach, and we are executing on some of those as we speak. And we still have capacity in these initiatives as we push forward. But, we have grown the organization over the last decade, I’ll call it, organically. And through that organic growth, it has yielded results that we think are very powerful for the Company over the past decade and have positioned the Company very well. As a matter of fact, our market share at the end of the first quarter right before COVID hit or even at the end of March period is at an all-time high. We think our overall positioning in the marketplace has improved over these seven months in many circumstances. And if we move forward, we should be in an even better position. But with respect to our financial resiliency program, we have looked and challenged ourselves at a number of areas where we have redundancies and/or duplications in our operations. Today, for example, we have multiple call centers. We think we have opportunity to create consolidation in those areas and create efficiencies, better outcomes for our patient and ultimately a better use of overall Company resources. We have similar opportunities in our lab services. Throughout the pandemic, we’ve enhanced our lab capabilities, and it’s enlightened us on opportunities to advance our lab services in a way that we think can yield efficiencies and better access to lab services and so forth, doing it more efficiently. And so, we have those type of examples. We’re challenging how we’re structured to see again if we have redundancies in our structure and whether or not there are better ways to service the field and produce outcomes on that front. And then, what I’m most excited about is our technology initiative where we have opportunities to advance technology even further in the Company and ultimately deliver a better patient outcome, but at the same time, support our physicians, support our management and deliver our services more efficiently. So, we think these work streams to have opportunities for the Company that we can use to offset any pressures that might serve us in 2021 and on into 2022.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ralph Giacobbe: I just want another clarification here. So, you said inpatient down 2% to 3% on sort of the core 2019, then plus COVID of sort of that 4% to 5%. So, net volume, call it, up 2%. I just wanted to frame that if that’s right. And then, I want to go back to competitive -- I just want to go back to the competitive positioning. In terms of if you’re able to figure out if you’re drawing sort of more of that acute population in your markets any more than before? And if so, why that would be the case?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Ralph, on the first one, I think, the 2% to 3% is just broad guidelines that we wanted to provide you with that would include all of our patients, including the COVID within that. But, obviously, we’re going to finalize our planning here and share with you more thoughts as we get into our year-end call. But, at 2% to 3% is our broad planning, including all patients.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. As it relates to the competitive positioning, we don’t have any data on the second and third quarter yet that would give us market share information and provide insights into whether we had more patients in our hospitals than our competitors. Intuitively, I don’t think that was the case because all the systems in these markets were under community pressure to respond to COVID. What I’m reacting to is certain outpatient opportunities, certain physician opportunities, certain program development opportunities that we think have evolved that positions our organization, we believe, better than what it was at the beginning of this year. And we will continue to, as I mentioned on the preview call, continue to move forward on those components of our development in order to enhance our overall position.
Operator: Your next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Justin Lake: Just a few quick numbers questions here. First, on EBITDA, similar to 2020 is kind of the EBITDA number you talked about. Should we assume revenues in that general ballpark as well in terms of what you gave us for 2020? And then, can you give us the overall payer mix numbers for 3Q? And finally, any October volume numbers you can share? I know you said volume improved there in terms of volume, surgeries, ER visits in October.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Justin, this is Bill. On the revenue side, it’s a little early. We know the composition of the revenue is changing as we’ve seen over these past couple of quarters. So, I don’t want to give parameters on the revenue yet till we complete our planning. On payer mix for the quarter, very quickly, our Medicare was roughly -- our inpatient payer mix was roughly 45%, our managed care, 24% and then self-pay was around 8% for the quarter. And then, what was the third one?
Justin Lake: The October volume numbers, anything early on surgery volumes, ER visits, inpatient, outpatient…
Bill Rutherford: Obviously, a sequential improvement in our admissions. As you saw, we finished the September at 2.6%. October is probably 1.5% down, a little better from where we ended September. But obviously, it’s still early in the cycle.
Operator: Your next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Josh Raskin: So just again, I sort of hate to harp on this, but the 2021 guidance of, let’s call it, $10.45 billion at the midpoint, that coming despite pretty significant improvement on the margin side, margin is up 500 basis points, excluding CARES Act in the quarter. And so, I’m curious, is there some offset? It doesn’t sound like revenues are going to be materially different than what you guys were assuming. So, is there some offsets, some costs that are coming back? And maybe specifically in that, supply expense has been down more than 50 basis points, despite this higher acuity. So, is there some assumption that some of that comes back as well?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Josh, I think there’s a couple of points. And there’s obviously a lot of puts and takes, whether performances, our thinking into next year, and we haven’t finalized it. One is, we know we do have some other government funding relative to COVID patients this year, whether it be the Medicare DRG add-on or the HRSA payments to recognize resources consumed by uninsured COVID. And I don’t think we see those continuing too long into 2021. And again, I think, the purpose of our guidance was to give you our general thinking versus that we’ve gone through a lot of calcs on each one of those inputs. And so, as we complete that, we’ll go forward and give you our input in that. I think, again, I’d reiterate, we’re confident in the team’s ability to hold many of our costs that we’ve seen. And as Sam mentioned in his comments, to the extent that we have any new costs that may enter the system, we’ve got resiliency plans that I think we can execute to help offset those. And I think, given the profile we’re seeing, we feel generally reasonably comfortable with our current margin performance.
Operator: Your next question comes from Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Frank Morgan: Sam, I think, you said you didn’t have any market share information yet around the different regions of the country. But, could you just give us some high-level perspective about the financial performance across HCA’s enterprise in different areas of the country? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: I don’t have it for the market share, Frank, for the second and third first quarter. We’re obviously just processing the first quarter. I think, we had one of the strongest portfolio performance in years across HCA’s 185 hospitals. 76% of our facilities had year-over-year EBITDA growth. So, we had very consistent performance across all of our divisions. To say one, we had a little bit of a challenge in the far west division, primarily because of our California hospitals and just the slow uptake in the activity in those communities. But our strength across the portfolio, it’s very good, consistent. And I think it again reflects the power of our portfolio, the diversification of our portfolio, including even the service mix that we have inside of it. So, very strong portfolio performance for the Company.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Brian Tanquilut: Just a two-part question for me. As I think about your guidance again, is that basically assuming that the economy stays where it is or you’re not expecting any further degradation in unemployment? And then, I guess, just for Bill, with $6.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, how should you be thinking about buybacks and the dividend resumption at some point? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Let me start with that. And so again, I think, as we mentioned in our comments, the balance sheet and our cash flow gives us a lot of flexibility and I think, capability of managing through different cycles. We’ve made -- haven’t made any decisions on capital allocation at this point or resumption of the share repurchase or dividend. We will complete our planning in ‘21 and announce kind of what our plans are. As we’ve said before, I think we have a pretty long history of having a balanced and disciplined approach to deploying our capital. And as we get some understanding of the market environment, we’re looking for when is the right time to resume some of that but we haven’t made any decisions at this point. About the economy?
Sam Hazen: I’ll take that. This is Sam. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we’re making these judgments off of our current read of economy, and we’re not factoring in any kind of significant worsening of the economy. So, obviously, if the economy were to worsen, it could have an impact on our expected results as we’ve indicated here.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kevin Fischbeck: Just maybe I want to follow up on that one. But the first part being, as far as the guidance, are you assuming that COVID starts off at about these levels at the beginning of the year and then kind of gradually goes away because the core business improves throughout the year, or is this kind of a steady state kind of assumption? And just a follow-up on that last question about capital deployment. If next year’s EBITDA is going to be more or less the same as this year’s EBITDA was supposed to be, what are the markers you’re looking for to get back to a normal capital deployment? I think with normal EBITDA, strong balance sheet, you’d expect a normal [Technical Difficulty] on that, but what are you looking for?
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. I’ll let Bill take the second question. With respect to the COVID assumption, our experience with COVID throughout the pandemic has been that it’s choppy. There are going to be situations where COVID is up; there’s going to be situations where COVID is down. We’re trying to give you some estimation of the average that we’re expecting. We are, at this particular point in time, balancing off what I call the floor. And we are not nearly as intense with the volume of patients today as we did in late July and early August. But, we are seeing a little bit of a rise, primarily in one market, and that’s El Paso. And that’s created a significant challenge in that community, but we only have two hospitals there. And at this particular point in time, we’re able to support them appropriately. And with the actions that the community has just recently taken as well as what the governor has done to support that community, we believe that we should be in a reasonable situation there. So, we’re not anticipating month-by-month estimations around COVID. We’re just going to respond to it with the capabilities we’ve developed. And we’re estimating what we believe to be an overall metric that is likely to occur in 2021.
Bill Rutherford: And Kevin, this is Bill on the capital. I don’t think there’s any one unique trigger that we’re looking for. I mean, we’re obviously still going through these cycles. We want a couple more stable months to kind of firm up our assessments that we’ve talked about. And part of our normal routine as we go through any year is to make those assessments, judge the environment we’re in and make the right capital decisions. That’s what we’re going to plan to do and we’ll share with you our final thinking in our year-end call.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Gillmor from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Matthew Gillmor: I wanted to follow up on the resiliency topic and the technology capability Sam mentioned. I think, Sam said technology was potentially the most exciting area. I think, it’s efficiency. And just hoping you could expand a little bit in terms of what that means, and if you had an example or two to conceptualize it for us?
Sam Hazen: Well, I’ll give you a very specific example that we’ve been able to use on two fronts this year. We have a system called NATE. NATE is a technology solution that gives us individual insight into every patient in our hospital right now. And that insight provides clinical metrics, it provides bed location, it provides certain metrics around what requirements the patient has with respect to, let’s just say, ventilator management. And we’ve been able to use those insights from this particular system to improve our ventilation management of COVID patients in a way that has reduced their length of stay on it and provided a much more efficacious outcome. So, that’s just one example that reduces ICU days. It creates a lower length of stay for the patient and ultimately, a much better outcome. So, we see opportunities to advance this system. The second aspect of NATE that’s proved to be very productive for us is capacity management, allowing us to position patients most efficiently within the facilities or even across our networks at time. So, this insight into our capacity management has allowed us to be, I think, more efficient at managing our beds and the turnovers, if you will, around those beds, providing better discharge planning and timing and then better utilization of existing assets. So, those are just two examples. We see opportunities beyond that as we’ve had experiences with clinical initiatives, like our sepsis initiative in the past. But going forward, we see more on that particular platform.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Lance Wilkes: Quick question on capacity, and I’m just interested in getting some color on what you guys are doing as far as being able to expand capacity in order to kind of recapture those avoided or deferred cases. And then what’s the net impact as you think about the COVID protocols that you are having to deal with?
Sam Hazen: On capacity, I mean, we have multiple capacity metrics that we use to determine needs for capital. We have triggers around how many ER visits per bed, how many surgeries per surgical suite, what’s the occupancy in our ICUs, what’s the occupancy triggers inside of our med/surg bed in order to determine capital needs. Currently, the Company is running about 70% utilization of its inpatient beds. Where we have capacity today, which won’t require the same level of capital, at least in the intermediate run is in the emergency room. With emergency room volumes being down some, we find ourselves in a situation where at a company level from one facility to the other, we may have issues. But at a Company level, we’re running about 60% to 65% utilization of our ER beds currently. That’s down from about 85% in 2019. So, we have the situation where our ER beds are flexible now, allowing us to accommodate more volume, if in fact, it presents itself. So, I don’t see capacity as being a barrier to growth for us. We do have capital still in the pipeline that will ultimately add capacity to institutions that we believe needed. And those will be playing out over the rest of this year and on into 2021. And I think, the Company is in a solid capacity position today, generally speaking, maybe in the best capacity position we’ve been in a number of years, given the circumstances. And so, from that standpoint, there’s not any significant pressures. I don’t remember what the last question was. Bill, do you...
Bill Rutherford: Yes. It was on the net effect of the COVID and the loss of those businesses. I’d just say it’s hard to really quantify and that’s why we -- I tried to give you some of the trends we saw in the surgical volume. We do know and as we’ve talked about before, we recaptured some of that, but we don’t think we recaptured all of that. And so, the net effect is really hard to quantify. But, we’ll continue to monitor our volume trends as they progress through the balance of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Andrew Mok: Hi This is Andrew Mok on for Steve. I just wanted to follow up on the slow ER volume recovery and expectations for a similar decline in 2021. Do you suspect that some of the ER volumes, especially on the lower acuity visits had left the hospital system permanently? How does that scenario impact your strategy and resource allocation from here? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam again. We don’t know, to be honest with you. We’re not anticipating a further decline in 2021. We’re anticipating that the ‘20 decline as compared to ‘19 volume, that’s the metric that we’re reflecting here. As I just mentioned, we’re running about 65% utilization of our emergency room beds across the Company, which gives us ample capacity to absorb growth, if growth resurfaces in this particular category of our business. If it doesn’t, as I mentioned, we’re anticipating that the ER patient that we do see is one that is in fact more acute. And so, the revenue per visit will actually be supported by the acuity of those patients. Whether or not they’ve been lost forever? I don’t know. Our business model is to have capabilities outside of the ER as we’ve been investing in both, urgent care platforms over the years, telemedicine platform significantly during COVID and then our primary care platform as well. So, we have multiple platforms to stay connected to the patient. That’s the important objective for us is ultimately to stay connected with them. And if they feel that it’s better for them to use telemedicine, better to go the urgent care, it’s better to go to their primary care physician. Obviously, we’re fine with that. That’s a great answer for them. It’s a great answer for the payer. And then, ultimately, they stay inside the HCA system. So, we see this, net-net, is still being a positive scenario for us and one that we can manage around.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you. Julianne, we’ve got time for two more questions, and we’re going to call it.
Operator: Your next question will come from Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Scott Fidel: Just interested in as you think about the mix of patients for next year and some of the assumptions that you have around COVID, just how you’re thinking about the timing and efficacy of the vaccines going into the market and how that influences your thoughts on some of this initial planning that you’re doing for 2021.
Sam Hazen: Okay. I’m going to ask Jon Perlin, our Chief Medical Officer, to answer that question. Thank you.
Jon Perlin: Thanks, Sam. I think, it’s really anyone’s guess as to when the vaccines are probably available. Certainly, they’re promising, but to get them broadly distributed requires a great deal of logistics. There is also broad skepticism. So, I think we have to think about next year COVID as sort of continuation of what we see now. Clearly, diseases that are spread by respiratory transmission increase in the winter. And I think, we’ll anticipate some increase and drop after that. There are a number of vaccines that follow the initial build. I think, there’s some speculation, they may be even better. And so, I think next year is really the year where we’ll see the introduction of vaccine, the larger scale uptick of vaccine and potentially greater effectiveness of the vaccines.
Operator: Your last question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Ransom: Just to drill down into COVID a bit. If we look at the quarter, do you have a sense of kind of payer mix within COVID? And then, for your commercial COVID, are they mostly paid on a per VM basis, or is this set up like the DRG with the 20% add-on and maybe a little extra for the commercial upgrade?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. John, this is Bill. Our COVID mix is probably 50% running Medicare, 10% to 11% on Medicaid, and probably close to 20% on just procure manage, and then we have a few other categories that’s impacting that. So, it’s fairly comparable to our overall with some changes that fluctuate from market by market. So, that’s the mix.
John Ransom: So, on your commercial, how do you take per day…
Bill Rutherford: It follows the contractual terms. So, whatever the contractual terms with that payer would be is what it would follow. So, it’s a mix of payment methodologies.
Mark Kimbrough: John, thank you so much.
Sam Hazen: There’s no commercial add-on per say, like the Medicare program. If that was his final...
Bill Rutherford: Yes, I think that was.
Sam Hazen: So, there is no -- it just follows the term as Bill indicated. 
Mark Kimbrough: All right, Julianne. I think, we can wrap it up.
Operator: All right. So, if you don’t have any closing remarks, this will conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for everyone’s participation. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-22 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. At this time, for opening remarks and instructions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Ian. And good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call and our webcast. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen and CFO, Bill Rutherford, as well Dr. Jon Perlin, our Chief Medical Officer. Sam and Bill will provide comments on the company's second quarter results and then we'll open up for questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in today's second quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. I will now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning. And thank you for joining today’s call. The second quarter was a remarkable 91 days for the company, possibly the most remarkable I've experienced in my 37 years with the organization. It started with a level of uncertainty and uneasiness that was very high as the pandemic began, the middle part was filled with example, after example of people inside our company, stepping up and delivering for each other and delivering for our patients. All the while strengthening our culture of taking care of others in the right way, whenever we are needed. And finally, it ended with the prowess of our teams on display, showing their abilities to manage relationships with their employees, respond to the needs of their physicians, deliver on operational adjustments that were necessary, given the circumstances and build clinical capabilities that not only give us more confidence in responding effectively to the ongoing challenges and resurgence of this pandemic, but provide us capabilities to improve our services and create even more value in the future. I've never been more proud to work with this company that I am now. As a shareholder, I hope you are equally as proud to be associated with HCA Healthcare. From day one, we addressed the pandemic with two clear objectives. The first was to protect our people that is keep them safe and keep them employed, giving them the assurances they needed both at work and at home. The second was to protect the company and that is protecting its financial positions, so we can continue to serve our communities for years to come. Both of these objectives endure today and directed by the guiding principles we laid out at the beginning of the pandemic, they allow us to provide the care patients deserve. Thus far, we have been able to achieve these foundational objectives because of the partnership and hard work of our 280,000 colleagues and 45,000 physicians. I want to thank them for their unwavering commitment and tremendous sacrifices in the midst of this global health crisis. In addition, thorough planning, solid execution, appropriate resource allocation and focus leadership all contributed to numerous positive outcomes. We also had strong collaboration with our partners, health plans, lab companies, suppliers, post-acute providers and others who I also want to thank. Every corner of this organization has come together to do what's right. In times of great uncertainty, our people continue to show up and pursue the path forward. We press on in that journey now. In pursue of the first objective, we implemented a number of pandemic pay programs to support our colleagues, including a program that continued income for them that otherwise would have ceased due to stay at home orders and reduce patient volumes. 145,000 colleagues benefited from these programs at a cost to the company of approximately $110 million. As a result, and I'm proud of this fact, not one employee in HCA Healthcare has been laid off or furloughed due to the pandemic. The HCA Hope Fund raised $4.5 million during the quarter and unprecedented level of contributions from employees, our board and the First Foundation. This year the fund has provided almost $2 million in grants to employees who needed emergency support. Our mission is to care for and improve human life, which primarily revolves around our patients, but it also, revolves around our employees. Truly, we care like family. Today, HCA Healthcare is taking care of more than 33,000 COVID-19 inpatients including over 5,000 patients who are currently in-house. Throughout this pandemic, we have developed more enterprise capabilities to respond to this crisis giving us greater confidence as we address the resurgence and the many challenges that exist in the communities that we serve. Examples of these capabilities include; enhanced clinical management protocols for patients on ventilators, increased lab testing capacity and improved turnaround times for results, currently 90% of COVID-19 lab results are produced in less than 48 hours, more sophisticated supply chain systems and logistics management, we have distributed over 20 million pieces of personal protective equipment to care givers. Additionally, we rapidly developed and deployed applications that manage capacity in case management requirements, increase telemedicine product offerings in capacity, we performed over 500,000 telemedicine visits in the quarter which was well above prior levels. And finally, we initiated various clinical research projects that should improve patient care in the future. Now let me transition to the earnings report. Like the first quarter, our business was significantly limited by governmental policies that restricted elective procedures and required communities to shelter at home. As many of our markets begin to reopen in May, patient volumes improved as our teams executed their reboot plans. Over the course of successive two-week period, we saw sequential improvements in most categories, ending the quarter with modest growth in admissions. For the quarter, admissions were down almost 13%. April was down 27%, May was down 12% and June was up 1%. Outpatient volumes across most categories also improved sequentially during the quarter, but we did not reach last year's level for any service. Emergency room visits and outpatient surgeries were each down 33% in the quarter. On the revenue side, the qualitative aspects of our inpatient -- specifically the following two factors drove a 10% increase year-over-year in inpatient revenue per admission. First, the overall acuity was higher with case mix index growing 3% and second, payer mix was better with commercial business representing 28% of admissions as compared to 26% last year. As a result, inpatient revenue was only down around 4%. Outpatient revenue declined 30% and in total, revenue decreased 12% as compared to the second quarter last year. The improvement in our financial results was generally better and broader than we expected but we believe it is too early for us to make any conclusive statements about the future or provide any guidance for the rest of the year. As we manage the company through these remarkable times, we are mindful of our mission as well as the many uncertainties that remain with respect to the broader recovery of the economy, uninsured levels, government regulations, state budgets and the resurgence and duration of COVID-19. In my comments last quarter, I spoke about the three-stage cost reduction plan we developed to respond to the different scenarios we had modeled. During the second quarter, we implemented first stage items and also many second stage items. Our teams did a masterful job in executing these plans. In the quarter, salaries and benefits, supplies and other operating expenses collectively declined approximately 11% as compared to the prior year. For the quarter, we reported pretax government stimulus income from the CARES Act of $822 million, which reduced expenses further and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.73. In sum, our overall performance was better than we expected, with diluted earnings per share of $3.16, an increase of 46% as compared to the second quarter last year. We continue to maintain a close watch on the macroeconomic factors that influence our business. Again, as we get further into the year, and gain a greater visibility into these factors and the performance of the company. We hope to be in a better position to evaluate the capital and operational decisions that we made earlier in the pandemic. Currently, we are dealing with resurgence of COVID-19 and many of our communities in particular Texas and Florida. We made the decision across both states to restrict elective procedures where appropriate, freeing up capacity and staffing while preserving PPE. We continue to work with state and local governments to coordinate community wide efforts. Thus far, we have been able to manage the situation and also provide non-elective care to non-COVID patients who need it. I mentioned in my comments last quarter that I had faith in our team's abilities to adjust their operations. And I believe they would once again respond to this challenge and deliver results. As you can see, they did it again. We are fortunate to have can do teams. I'm confident they will continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders. Even though the second quarter felt a lot longer to me the 91 days. I'm reminded once again, what an incredible and resilient organization we have. One that is driven by common purpose to do the right thing for others. As I've highlighted today, we accomplished a lot during this time across multiple dimensions of our business. These accomplishments, I believe, will position us well for long-term success and continue to the great legacy that is HCA Healthcare. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill Rutherford for more details on our financial results.
Bill Rutherford: Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some additional information on the quarter. As we expected, the second quarter saw progressive improvement each month of the quarter as we evolved from the initial response phase early in the quarter, and then enter the reboot phase during the second half of the quarter. We saw an improvement from the middle of April, which was our low volume point throughout the quarter in most every volume statistic. Our same facility admissions declined 12.8% in the quarter compared to the prior year period, and the monthly progression as Sam mentioned in his comments on admissions occurred with most of our key volume indicators. Same facility inpatient surgeries declined 15.7% in the quarter, with April declining about 38%, May was down 12% and June was up 3% over the prior year. Same facility hospital-based outpatient surgeries were down about 27% in the quarter, with April down about 65%, May down about 19% in June was up 4% from the prior year. Our outpatient surgeries in our ambulatory surgery centers were down about 40% in the quarter with April down 85% May down 32% and June was up 1% over the prior year. Our teams did an incredible job of managing our cost structure during this period of significant volume and revenue fluctuation during the quarter. We began adjusting most of our discretionary and variable expenses in late March and April, when the volume declines were most pronounced. We were able to sustain many of the expense improvements throughout the quarter as the volumes began to improve in May and June. As reflected in our financial statements, our reported revenues declined about $1.5 billion, or 12.2% in the quarter from the prior year period. Our salaries and benefits supplies and other operating expenses collectively declined approximately $1.1 billion or 10.5% during the quarter compared to the prior year. This is a testament to our management teams across the company, and highlights our ability to adequately adjust to the sudden volume declines as well as efficiently serve the increased volumes we saw during the reboot phase. Let me highlight a couple of other important items in the quarter starting with the CARES Act. As we discussed last quarter, the company is very appreciative of the government's recognition of the significant impact this pandemic has had on healthcare providers across the country. As I alluded to previously, our revenue was significantly impacted during the quarter due to this pandemic and the subsequent stopping of most elective procedures. In addition, we experienced significant costs in the preparation and response phase, including our pandemic pay program, other employee assistance efforts, as well as securing adequate supply chain items. We believe the CARES Act funding was developed to account for this volume disruption and to offset some of these costs, both of which began impacting us in the first quarter and to ensure healthcare providers across the country could continue to offer critical services to the communities they serve. As noted in our release and financial statements, we recognized $822 million of government stimulus income from the CARES Act during the quarter. This equates to about $590 million on an after-tax basis. As of June 30th, we had received approximately $1.4 billion of CARES Act stimulus funding. This included about $920 million from the general distribution and about $450 million from certain targeted distributions for rural and safety net hospitals, as well as hotspot funding. We have not recognized any of the targeted distributions in our P&L as of June 30th, as we are still performing the required analysis and attestation process. The evaluation period and guidance related to the relief fund continue to evolve and as a result, we’ve recognized $822 million of the $920 million in general distribution funds received in the quarter. Subsequent to June 30th, we’ve received approximately $300 million in additional targeted distribution funds. Before I conclude, let me speak briefly to some cash flow balance sheet and liquidity metrics. As we mentioned in our first quarter call, the company took a number of measures early in this pandemic cycle, including entering into a $2 billion short term credit facility, suspending our share repurchase program and quarterly dividend, as well as reducing planned capital expenditures. These were in addition to a number of operational adjustments, we mentioned earlier. All of these efforts have enhanced the company's liquidity and capability to manage through these uncertain times. As of June 30th, 2020, the company had $7.7 billion of capacity under our credit facilities and $4.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Our debt to EBITDA leverage was 2.7x as of June 30th, 2020, after netting out our cash on the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $8.72 billion for the quarter, which includes the following components. We received approximately $4.4 billion in advanced Medicare payments during the quarter. These amounts are scheduled to be repaid over an eight-month period, beginning in August of 2020. Cash flow from operations was also fairly impacted by the approximate $1.4 billion of CARES Act funding received during the quarter, I mentioned earlier, as well as the deferral of estimated income tax payments to the third quarter of approximately $200 million and payroll tax deferrals, that will be paid in late 2021 and 2022 of approximately $200 million. As we mentioned in our first quarter call, we’ve reduced the company's plan capital expenditures. At this point, we anticipate reducing our capital spending to approximately $2.8 billion to $3 billion for 2020, as compared to our original plan of approximately $4.2 billion for the year. This remains subject to further evaluation of operating trends and opportunities. In short, we believe the steps that we implemented have enhanced the company's financial flexibility as we navigate these unprecedented times. We continue to believe the strength, scale and resiliency of HCA are longstanding and critical attributes that served us well, not only during this past quarter, but we'll continue to service as we can go through the future cycles of this pandemic. So, with that, let me turn the call over to Mark and we'll open it up for Q&A.
Mark Kimbrough: Okay, well thank you, Bill. We will now start the question and answer session. Ian, would you please give instructions to those who would like to get into the queue.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about decremental margins and what you're seeing in COVID effective phase to go into late-June and into July. So, appreciate all the color. The decremental margins were incredibly strong this quarter. I think they're only down about 30% -- near about 30%. Just curious if that's something that you think is sustainable going forward. And then can you give us some color on what's happening in Florida and Texas in late June into July as in terms of volumes and payer mix? We've seen significant pick up in the COVID cases there. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Hey, good morning, Justin. So, let me start with that and I'll pass Sam to add in. So, as we mentioned, I think the acuity of the patients that returned were a higher than they were pre-pandemic. As we saw some of our higher acuity patients in cardiology, neurosciences and orthopedics returned. And the lower acuity patients were maybe the ones that will take a little bit longer to return. In addition, we had favorable kind of ICU and NICU days. There was a high that contributed to the acuity. And so, I do think that the margin generations of those higher acuity patients as they return were higher than normal and what they were pre-pandemic. As we mentioned throughout our prepared remarks, we're very pleased with the response of our operating teams and the efforts we are able to make around discretionary costs and managing the variable cost. And we're very pleased with how we finished the quarter on that. Sam, do you want to give any comments on going forward?
Sam Hazen: Well, let me speak to Texas and Florida. Those are the two states where we have seen COVID-19 resurgence at its greatest level. We have other components of our company where we are seeing COVID volumes, but they're not to the level that we had seen in Texas and are seeing in Florida. In Texas which was a little bit ahead of Florida, if you will, with respect to the resurgence. I think the company has done an incredible job at responding to the needs of our communities, as have our competitors. And I think it's a testament to the healthcare system in the country, and its ability to respond to these challenges from one place to the other. What we've seen in Texas is that our volume for COVID patients have peaked and actually started to decline. Whereas in Florida, we've seen a flattening out in a very modest growth rate over the last week. And we hope Florida is maybe a week behind what's going on inside of Texas. In total, our activity levels are up slightly in July as compared to June with respect to overall in patient census. Clearly with our decision to restrict elective care to manage our response to the community, we have seen a slowdown in surgical activities. But we anticipate recovering that at some point in the future as we get better visibility into the COVID cases in the different communities. Our teams have done an incredible job as I mentioned in my comments. Our physicians have supported our teams incredibly well. And then our corporate and other teams have made capabilities available to our institutions, allowing us to respond very appropriately. So, I'm really pleased with our outcomes. And we do believe that we're going to have to manage through COVID again. It's not something that's going to go away necessarily. But our ability to scale up, scale down, scale up, I think is now been proven. We've gained greater confidence in our ability to run our business, and at the same time respond to surges. And so, the execution and the agility that our facilities and our teams have showed over this period of time helps us in developing learnings that we will be able to advance as we go forward on into this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Gary Taylor: Hi, thank you. Really impressive expense management in the quarter. It's really commendable. I guess I just want to follow up a little bit and understand what you're saying. I think I understand that too. So, if we look at this improving trajectory of revenue and volume through the quarter. And we get to July, you're saying inpatient census is up but I guess COVID is fueling some of that. And surgical volume is down. Is that really, I mean, just really happening sort of in Texas and Florida and not in the hotspots? Is there diversity of that experience even in those states? And then when we look at the rest of the portfolio that perhaps isn't being as hit by the resurgence as much. Are you still generally seeing an improving trajectory out of June into July? So, I guess we're trying to get at is there any sort of pent-up demand that's now diminishing or is it really just the virus that's causing some of the surgical activity to slowdown in some of those hotspots?
Sam Hazen: All right, thanks, Gary. Well, we have not restricted elective procedures or surgeries in markets where we don't have a need to respond to COVID. So obviously, in Texas it started out, in Houston in the Valley and those were the first markets where we implemented our elective procedure decisions. Then as it expanded to San Antonio, we replicated that in that market so it’s sequenced based upon the circumstances and it will unsequence if you will, based upon the circumstances. So, in Dallas, for example which is not as significantly impacted by COVID, we've started to relax some of our procedure, requirements and restrictions in order to deal with the circumstances in those communities. So, we're going to see some natural ebb and flow in Florida similarly and then if we were to see it somewhere else, we would use those experiences that we learned in Texas, in Miami as an example to manage the situation. And this is what we're required to do with respect to our responsibilities as community infrastructure. We take it seriously and we think we've been able to prove to ourselves and prove to the community that we can respond effectively to the needs of our patients whatever COVID does surface at a level that’s much greater than what we were seeing in April and May. And we had some of this activity in June in some markets where we had COVID surge going on. It wasn’t as hot profile as what it was in Texas and Florida. Again, we were managing through that within our portfolio similarly in learning from that Gary and putting those learnings into our experiences now. And I'm confident that we will continue to learn and gain greater capabilities in managing the volume requirements in the ups and downs of this particular pandemic.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Yes, great job on the crazy quarter. Maybe just ask about the backlog or the pent-up demand, I don't know whether there’s any way that you're able to assess maybe through your doctor practices what that looks like, is that something that's going to go through the rest of the year? Could that spill over into next year? And there's been discussion about rebuilding a new pipeline not just working through the backlog; can you talk about your sense of people doing the primary care and to build the case backlog for surgeries in orthopedics and all that stuff? And then if I could just slip one other in, Bill mentioned the CapEx decline, can you comment on what, where you're pulling back on CapEx and should we assume that you’ll have to do more next year as a result of pulling back this year or these things that will permanently go away? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Okay, A.J. it’s Sam. Thank you for the question. What I'll give you some observations. It's really difficult for us to pinpoint precisely what's going on in these circumstances. But we believe that approximately 40% to 50% of the deferred cases during the six to seven week period where most of our company was restricted on what we can do have been recaptured. And by recaptured, I mean either done or scheduled. So, the other 40% to 50% that hasn't been recaptured, we don't have visibility into the timing of that yet. Our positions continue to build back their practices just as we're building back our business in a way that should hopefully recapture some of that gap that I just mentioned, but we don't have great visibility into that as of yet. What I will tell you also is that, our ambulatory surgery centers were slower in their ramp up because they were at a complete stop versus our hospitals, which were continuing to run during the pandemic period. And so, they have ramped a little bit slower as Bill alluded to in his comment. What we saw within our surgery was procedures, orthopedic, spine, general surgery recovered quicker and stronger. We also saw a slower recovery in our GI procedures and certain diagnostic categories, which started to ramp significantly at the end of June, which gives us a belief that downstream those diagnostic patients and encounters will ultimately require some level of therapy, whether it's surgery or something else. So, we have some insights into it. We believe we'll need through the third quarter, probably through the fourth quarter to have a better sense of what the full recapture was of the cases that were in fact deferred. In cardiology, components of our cardiology business recovered really well, mainly electrophysiology and the procedures in that particular category. So, we had a mixed bag of events in the second quarter. And there are some indications of decent recovery in certain service lines, still more to come in others, and we will continue to monitor and try to gain insights from within our physician practices, whether they're affiliated or employed and within the different markets that we think are more advanced in their recovery period than others. And let that inform some of our observations further as we go into this next quarter.
Bill Rutherford: Yes, AJ, this is Bill. We think it was prudent at the time to reduce our capital spending, as we talked about last quarter and updated on this quarter, most of those projects were either deferral or slowing down some activity that was in the pipeline, as well as some deferral of our IT capital. We don't believe any of those decisions have compromised the strategic or growth initiative for us at this point, actually during the quarter, we turned on a couple of projects that we felt there was compelling opportunities out there. As far as next year, we'll have to see what the marketplace and the environment is. I don't think just because we deferred these, that we'll have to substantially increase over what we ordinarily would have planned, but we'll continue to evaluate that as we go through these different cycles.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Pito Chickering of Deutsche bank. Your line is open.
Pito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and excellent job in a very challenging environment to the whole team over at HCA. So, the question here is actually on the cost control side. You walked us through the revenue ramp throughout the quarter, but can you walk us through these sustainability, the cost control leverage that you put into place in April and March, and if the June positive revenues continue into July and the third quarter. How should we think about the cost controls you put in place?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Pito, this is Bill. Let me give a start to that. I think generally speaking, we can hold much of the cost controls that we put in place, as we said, most of those were around adjusting some of our discretionary spending, as well as some of the variable cost, like as Sam mentioned in his comments. We do know this recent COVID surge, we have to make sure we have the appropriate labor to serve that surge that may result in some increase use of either contract or premium labor. But I think as a whole, our teams have done a nice job. We continue to have opportunities to continue to look at other discretionary spending that we have. So, I think we've got a little bit of a track record of being able to manage to the environment, managed to the revenue that we have. We're very pleased with the results and we'll just going to have to see how the volume returns. And what are the variable costs that we're going to need to support that. But we feel for the most part, we can hold much of the expense adjustments that we made during the quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor of Baird. Your line is open.
Matthew Gillmor: Hey, thanks for the question. I was hoping I could get an update on the competitive landscape and maybe the potential for some M&A in the future. I know the industry is obviously working very collaboratively right now. But are you seeing any health systems that will be attractive partners for HCA struggling at all? And do you think you'll have more shots on goal from an M&A standpoint as you look out over the next one or two years?
Sam Hazen: Thank you, Matt. This is Sam, Matt. I don't know that we have any insights yet -- market insights into competitor issues or opportunities that might exist. I think everybody is scrambling in many markets to deal with COVID-19 and discharge their responsibilities appropriately. And the likelihood of any strategic decisions being made during this particular period in time I think is probably not that high. We will continue to explore. We have a very robust pipeline for outpatient facility development and/ or acquisitions that we're very excited about. And they're complementing of our existing networks. And we'll continue to look for adjacency -- with adjacencies within that platform, as it relates to new market opportunities, and so forth, I would just have to be, I think aware and open to those but very conservative and appropriate and how we think about them. And capital allocation, as Bill just alluded to in our planning. I don't know though, at this point in time that we're going to see anything in the short run. I think it's going to take systems a while to get through this period and then start to determine what their appropriate steps are. But as we've done in the past, we have been opportunistic, with respect to certain acquisitions. And we will continue to maintain that philosophy and appropriately move forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Whit Mayo of UBS. Your line is open.
Whit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe it's too early to tell. But any color around payer mix, and then any help on any internally developed framework to think about what the impact could be on HCA going forward? I mean I know you've had a lot of time to address this. And just wanted to get an updated view because my sense is that you're probably not seeing any meaningful change. And, I guess call it your core payer mix now. And maybe just an update on your self-pay and balance after reserve. Just where those are?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, this is Bill. As we mentioned in the payer mix, we did see some favorable in the payer mix as our commercial declines were a little less than or Medicare declines which makes sense that that the Medicare population may take a little bit longer time to return to a healthcare facility. Our uninsured volumes remained consistent with our overall volumes that we haven't seen any material kind of differential with our self-pay volume. Going forward, that's obviously an area that we're paying attention to. We're doing a lot of study market by market to track various factors, whether that be unemployment or coverage. I think it is too early to be able to predict how that may unfold. But clearly some of those factors will contribute to some of the uncertainty as we face the future. And factor into some of our decision. But we haven't seen a play out right now. But as we go forward, it's an area that we continue to monitor. And we have some data that we're trying to track to give us some insight as we go into our 2021 planning cycle.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open.
Steven Valiquette: Great thanks. Good morning, everybody. So now generally speaking, I think most investors are have been thinking about 2Q,'20 likely being a trough for the hospital industry profitability, then sequential improvements and 3Q and 4Q. And I guess my question is if we just ignore the stimulus money and look at your strong $1.85 billion of operational EBITDA generated in 2Q just operationally. Should the investment community generally assume that operational EBITDA will continue to improve sequentially, at least in 3Q from the $1.85 billion base that we see things right now? And despite the fluid situations in Florida and Texas are the two or to make that call right now, just on the quarterly cadence?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Steven. This is Bill. Let me try. I think the reality is there are still many unknowns relative to the duration and impact this pandemic will have. One of the reasons we cannot update or guidance at this point. It's unclear the longer-term macroeconomic impact of how this might change the overall landscape including patient behavior, the economy, employment and coverage and alike. So, these are kind of somewhat unprecedented times for so it's really hard to really project on a quarter by quarter basis what we might see. What we do know is that we've demonstrated and I think as we demonstrated in this quarter, we have plans in place to respond I think to a range of scenarios that might unfold. And we have different stages of management actions based on how either volume returns or what that makes may be and alike. So, we'll continue to assess the market, let you know what we're seeing as we go through the year. But right now, we're just unable to convert that to any type of financial guidance going forward and we just have to wait to see how the market place unfolds.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Kevin Fischbeck: Thanks. I guess just try to go back to the pace and timing of volumes and like you guys obviously operate in a lot different markets across the country. I don't know if you have any experience about markets that maybe got hit a little bit earlier from COVID and have since rebounded and whether the elective procedures coming back are coming back a lot quicker in those markets or if it's more balance? I guess in the past you've given some data about procedures by the different regions that you guys or divisions that you guys have maybe color there and maybe as far as June goes, how many of those 14 or kind of at or above where they were because it sounds like June rolls up but what percent those regions you're seeing about average volumes?
Sam Hazen: So, here's how we looked at the recovery, we base lined everything off of April and we looked at May and June and highlighted within our portfolio what the revenue growth was in each of those months’ vis-a-vis April. And for the most part, we had remarkably consistent performance across the divisions with the exception of a couple of spots. Those two spots were out West in California primarily and then, in Miami secondarily. And that was because of releasing the restrictions a little bit slower in parts of California than Texas and Tennessee and places like that as an example and then Miami was dealing with COVID in a totally different scenario and their restrictions were released a little bit differently. But within those two brackets, most of our divisions ramped reasonably consistent as it relates to their revenue growth over April. And so that's how we judged it, again it's very difficult for us to get very specific observations from one category to the other within procedures and so forth but looking at the revenue recovery as the better metric, we were able to see remarkable consistency across the rest of the company with respect to gains over April.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Frank Morgan: Good morning. It sounds like in your comments that you really are more prepared as an enterprise for ebbs and flows and COVID volumes. And I'm just curious do you think that plays out with doctors, with physicians as well as patients in that over time if we do have another flare up in the fall of that? I mean, basically we all become more desensitized as we figure out operate in the whipsaws that we see become less noticeable in the future. And I guess related to that you did talk about on this current surge an increase in things like premium labor, contracted labor and alike. Maybe just any color you can tell us about general profitability of these COVID patients. Are they; is it actually a profitable business when you bring it in? And then last just any DC perspective, Bill made some comments about the funding you receive and yet you've got lost revenue and higher costs. Any thoughts around additional relief funding for the hospital industry? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Yes, so Frank let me speak to the ability to respond downsize, upsize, and respond again. I think we've proven to ourselves as I mentioned an ability to manage through that operationally as a facility and as a company. Also think, government -- many state governments have learned how to respond and to dial up, dial down maybe some of their policies. I think this is my judgment only those individuals understand how to dial up, dial down their social activities in a way that is responsive to what's going on in their communities as well. So, I think all of this is creating a bit of muscle memory, if you will, with respect to COVID-19. It's our belief that we're going to have to maintain that memory, use that memory again and be able to deal with the potential flare off that might occur until we have a vaccine or a different kind of therapeutic remedy that would allow for less COVID activity in our communities. So, I think it's not just us, it's policies, it's business, it's individuals, all taking advantage of these learnings and applying them to the situations that we believe will still exist in the future until there is some vaccine. So, Bill.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Frank, I think it's too early to talk about the profitability of COVID patients. What we do know early on is that our COVID patients that we saw did have a generally a higher acuity than our typical medical patient, just given a longer length of stay, a higher proportion in intensive care units. So, and there were some add-on payments by Medicare, as we know but too early to really convert that to profitability. Our focus is really making sure that we've got all the resources to be able to care for those patients.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Your line is open.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. First, just wanted to clarify, you said June inpatient admission was about 1% and July inpatient was running ahead or was that commentary just on Texas? And then more specifically on the ER volume, I know down 33%, what are some of the initiatives you're working on to get maybe people more comfortable to come in, if any, and then you've been talking for a while on access points and increasing those access points. Where are you with that and how does the backdrop sort of change or accelerate that? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Thank you, Ralph. So, what I mentioned, this is Sam. What I mentioned on July was that our inpatient census was up over June. We haven't finished the month yet. So, it's difficult to say exactly where admissions are going to be. With respect to emergency room activity, again, we saw sequential improvement in the rate of decline in our emergency room business in the second quarter with June being down, maybe half of what it was down or third less what was the third, 15% down versus a roughly 40% down, I think it was in April. So, we saw significant improvement, if you will, from the rate of decline. What we also saw inside of our emergency room business was greater acuity. We had similar to our inpatient, a bit business, greater acuity in our ER patients who visited our facilities and that yielded revenue per ER, visit that was slightly above our expectations. So, the business that we're losing is the lower acute business, which you would expect. We saw within our freestanding emergency rooms slightly quicker ramp up than we did our hospital-based ERs. Again, some of that could be due to patient concerns with respect to COVID. We have a very aggressive campaign, both operationally from a patient safety standpoint, as well as a communication standpoint with our patients on demonstrating to them, the safe environment that they deserve when they come to one of our facilities. As it relates to developing our outpatient platform, in order to support our hospitals, we continue on that pathway. We think it's an important part of taking the care experience to the patient, creating a more efficient, and a better price point for them. And we will continue to invest in that platform. We currently have a number of our outpatient facilities that are reopening as a result of the COVID pandemic closures that took place. So, each week we opened more of what we had previously close. We're not up to a 100% reopening of our freestanding ERs in some markets or urgent care centers and other markets. On top of that will be telemedicine. We have, as I mentioned in my comments developed rather quickly, a telemedicine capability, which is critically important, we think to furthering our access strategies for our patient and creating convenience for them and efficiency for our physicians. So, we will continue to invest in that and build capabilities that support that as a wraparound platform. So, I'm very encouraged about what we have done. I'm encouraged about what we're seeing in the recovery in these outpatient activities. And as we move forward, I anticipate that we will continue to develop these wraparound capabilities that support our facility, our hospitals in a way that make it easy for our patients. And then if they need deeper care, they can get more sophisticated and deeper care inside of our hospitals.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ranson of Raymond James. Your line is open.
John Ransom: Hey, good morning. I'll add my congratulations. That's remarkable job in an unprecedented situation. I'm curious, as we look at July and you've got at least temporarily some inpatient capacity constraints in Texas and Florida. Have you been able to either through flexing capacity or moving things to outpatient? Have you been able to move material amount of maybe what would have been an impatient elective a year ago into a different setting? Or is it kind of looked like it did before?
Sam Hazen: Thanks, John. Well, I think, this is Sam again. What we have done with capacity management to deal with COVID is quite remarkable. We've developed technology capabilities to give us real time insights into our patient population into every bed in the facility at any point in time. Also giving us an indication of their clinical condition allowing us to think about and work with their physician to possibly place them in different settings. That has allowed us to increase the throughput in many respects, versus what we were able to do in the past. So that's an outgrowth of what happened during COVID that we think is going to create value for our patients, create better use of our assets in the future and create more value for our payer, partners in the future as well. The other thing that we've done during COVID is we have been able to what we call level load patients across our network. And by that, I mean getting patients into the right facility, even when we know we're going to have a pressure point at a particular facility because of the community issues that are going on. So, moving patients to where we had staffing or moving patients to where we had beds was another piece of capabilities. I think we advanced. We do that all the time with Hurricane, as we deal with hurricanes. But we took our hurricane learnings and applied that to COVID situations where we had stress. The area where we've seen slight acceleration of inpatient to outpatient over what we saw pre-COVID is in some of our surgical cases, mainly orthopedic total joints, where there was a natural progression of inpatient to outpatient. It's slightly higher post-COVID than it was pre- COVID. It's not significantly higher, but it is higher. And is that something that's going to continue? We believe that it will be there. We anticipated in our planning, our multiyear planning those orthopedic total joints would continue to migrate to more outpatient activity. But we're built for that. We collaborated with our physicians on making sure that we're dealing with the patient in the proper setting. We have an ambulatory surgery center platform, that if that's the best setting, they can go to that. So, we have prepared ourselves for this migration. Outside of total joints, I wouldn't submit that there's anything material that's taken place. That's been part of our overall capacity management. It needs to be clinically driven, not capacity driven. And as long as it's clinically effective for the patient, and will support that and hopefully accomplish that in a way that's productive for the capacity and at the same time appropriate for the patient.
Operator: All right. Your next question comes from line of Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research. Your line is open.
Joshua Raskin: Hi, thanks and appreciate the work you did, but also taking the question here. So, mine on the CARES Act funding, you received, I think, a total of $1.4 billion plus an additional $300 million after the quarter. You recognize $822 million. And I understand the difference between the general distributions of $920 million and then the more targeted what seems like $750 million or so. So, I guess the question is do you think you're going to be able to actually recognize even that incremental $100 million or $98 million of the general distribution, or any of the targeted distributions? You just not seen that level of impact either volumes or costs?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Joshua. This is Bill. Let me try to highlight that. As you might know, the terms and conditions and general guidance for these funds continue to evolve and update. And for the most part, you have a 90 day or longer period to go through an analysis and attestation process. And we're in the middle of our analysis and validation procedures for those funds right now. So, it's really too early to talk about when and how much we might recognize in the future. We continue to monitor the guidance that comes out from various government agencies and we continue to do our analysis for the targeted funds. We have till mid to late third quarter or even July in the fourth quarter. So, we'll continue our analysis and go forward and we'll discuss really what that results when we go through future periods.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Scott Fidel of Stephens. Your line is open.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. And thanks for fitting me in here. I've just had one other CARES question as well and just relating to the Medicare advance payments that you and the others have receive at the industry. And I know those payments are supposed to get started to get paid back in August and over the course of eight months. Obviously, still a lot of virus impact and it seems like a lot of other hospitals in the industry are facing a lot of financial pressure still. So just interested if you're hearing any or you have any line of discussions with CMS in terms of them maybe looking to delay in terms of when facilities are required to start repaying those Medicare advance funding that was paid out of 2Q.
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Scott. This is Bill. I know there's been some discussion, but I don't have any insight into how those have progressed. As you probably know, it's scheduled to be repaid and offset against Medicare claims in the future beginning in August. So, we'll just have to see what that cadence goes. But I know there's been some discussion, we read about some potential altering how those funds and what the time period may be. But I don't have any insight on what ultimately may come from those discussions.
Mark Kimbrough: All right, Scott. Thank you for the question. Appreciate it. All right. Listen, thank you. I want to thank everybody who joined us today and participated on the call. As always, we're here to answer any of your questions. And so, take care. Have a good day and be safe. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-21 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. At this time, for opening remarks and instructions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Marcella. Good morning. And welcome to all of you on today's call and our webcast. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen and CFO, Bill Rutherford. And also joining us this morning is Dr. Jon Perlin, our Chief Medical Officer. Sam and Bill will provide comments on the company's first quarter results and also the company's response to COVID-19. Then we'll open up for questions. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, numerous risk, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and those factors are listed in today's press release and our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses or gains on the sales of facilities, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in today's first quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. I will now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning. And thank you for joining the call. I will focus my comments this morning on the COVID-19 pandemic and direct you to our earnings release for the financial results for the first quarter. In general, the first 80% of the quarter was very similar to the growth we have experienced over the past two years, and was a reflection of the momentum we had heading into the year. Then the effects of the pandemic begin to hit us in mid-March. We will answer any questions you have about the first quarter's results following our comments. The early planning and preparations we did for COVID-19 involved updating clinical policies and operational guidance, preparing supply chain with added inventory levels for key personal protective equipment, drugs and ventilator equipment. It also included building approaches to add capacity for potential surge in patient volumes, leveraging data, initiating our emergency operations center and refining our management structure to execute. Like most things in our company, the basic approach was to find ways to maximize unique enterprise capability, leverage financial resources and further develop corporate relationships with other to support our hospitals. HCA Healthcare has a storied history of responding well to disasters, such as natural disasters like hurricanes and floods, as well as mass casualty events like the concert shooting in Las Vegas. We used these past experiences to guide and inform the planning and response during the crisis, which was the first one we would face at enterprise scale. This event has required us to respond differently with a structure that included a more balanced approach between corporate support, division coordination and facility execution. As part of our plan, we developed five guiding principles that established a framework for decision making and actions through the crisis. These principles are simple yet extremely powerful and they endure today. They are as follows; first, protect our employees and physicians; second, be there for patients; third, partner with others; next, be a resource for communities and government; and last, accelerate the company through the crisis. We started this effort and we still remain focused on protecting the safety and health of our employees and physicians as the first principle. We enhanced training, established better PPE acquisition, distribution and control systems, implemented a universal masking policy and improved lab testing turnaround time as part of this endeavor. We have cared for approximately 5,500 positive COVID-19 in-patients so far across the company. We were early to implement universal masking of care providers and to-date we have had limited exposures to employees and doctors. A strong corporate culture is the bedrock of HCA Healthcare. This event has reinforced its importance and provided us with an opportunity to see it in action every day. Our dedicated and caring employees are the lifeblood of the company. To-date, we have not laid off or furloughed one employee as a result of the pandemic. Instead, we adopted a pandemic pay program that supports approximately 80,000 employees who are not getting their normal hours as a result of reduced overall volume. Almost 11,000 corporate and division colleagues graciously took a salary cut of 10% to 30% for April and May, depending upon their compensation level as a show of solidarity for our caregivers in the hospital. Additionally, over 90% of our support staffs are working productively from home. This remote work model has provided insight into operational efficiencies for the future and is about one example of organizational learning from this event. To further support our colleagues, many within the organization have contributed to the HCA hope fund, which is a 501(c)3 charity that is exclusively focused on providing support to fellow colleagues when they experience hardships in their lives. In less than one month, the fund has received unprecedented levels of contribution from employees, board members and the Frist Foundation, a true testament to our culture, mission and value. Already, the whole front has over $1.3 million in grant applications that have either been paid or pending approval from more than 1200 employees. It is times like these that test whether we honor our mission or not. We choose to honor it. For Affiliated Physicians, we have implemented a COVID-19 response model that includes partnering with other technical experts to assist them with navigating the Cares Act and accessing certain benefits available to them. Also, HCA Healthcare is a large medical office landlord and we took a leadership position and many of our third-party developers have followed in implementing a rent deferral program, which addresses medical practice or business disruption and maintains availability of medical care and related services for patients and the community. This program, which is allowed through federal waivers, provides relief for our tenants over the next few months. We have also provided similar relief to physician partners and our ambulatory surgery centers. We have great relationships with our physicians and we wanted to help them through this difficult period. The second guiding principle was to be there for our patients and we have been. Our employees have shown up, our physicians have shown up, they have been on the front line and they have not wavered during this pandemic crisis in meeting their responsibilities of placing patients first. We've had ample capacity across our system to serve community needs. We have used the logistical capability of our supply chain to move supplies and ventilator equipment to needed hospitals. We have increased significantly telemedicine capabilities, the key patients in touch with their physicians. We have numerous research projects underway with our Sarah Cannon Research Institute as we continue to find ways to improve critical care medicine protocols for COVID-19 patients, lab testing methods, drug therapies and much more. And lastly, we have used our internal supplemental staffing organization to enhance personnel need when and where necessary across the enterprise. HCA Healthcare is a nation of heroes. I want to thank our colleagues and physicians for their unwavering commitment to patients, their tremendous sacrifice and hard work and their remarkable teamwork and dedication to each other. I salute them and I know their community salutes them as well. The third principle was to partner with others and forge new relationships. We have evolved existing relationships with other companies in the industry to collaborate and solve problems. We have developed new relationships that allowed us to accelerate protocols for in-patient COVID-19 testing that have become the norm for many health systems. We have partnered with a technology company to advance monitoring of community resources and illnesses. We believe these relationships and others will benefit us in the future as we see many opportunities for further enhancing our shared commitment and creating more value for patients and the communities we serve. I want to thank the leadership of these organizations for their collaboration and commitment to support our hospitals. The fourth guiding principle was to be a resource for the community and for government, both local and federal .we have collaborated with local health systems, health agencies, first responders and many more. Our teams are working directly with FEMA, CDC and recently we took a leadership position in developing with the federal government and the American Hospital Association a dynamic ventilator response network that will utilize excess inventories across the country to support needs in COVID-19 hotspots as they arise. We believe these types of public private sector partnerships are necessary and valuable in responding to a public health emergency of this type and in creating channels of understanding between sectors. And the last guiding principle was to accelerate HCA Healthcare through this crisis and position the company for success in the future. This principle means that we are focused on using this pandemic to learn more and to learn faster. It demonstrates also our capacity for improving and becoming more agile at planning, executing, communicating and processing solutions more effectively. And finally, this principle means that we as a company take steps to navigate appropriately through this difficult and uncertain period for the benefit of all stakeholders. We view our networks as part of and fundamental to community infrastructure. Across the 43 communities we serve, our local health systems have a sacred responsibility to always be there when needed. To meet this promise, we must take prudent and necessary actions. As part of our planning, we took a number of steps, which we believe are appropriate to protect the company and be there for the people we serve. The culture of HCA Healthcare is laser focused on the patient. Our strategy, our decisions and our resource allocation revolve around that. We also have a strong track record when it comes to making decisions that benefit our shareholders. The philosophy we have with respect to shareholder value remains. We continue to believe that a capital allocation strategy of reinvesting in our business and repurchasing stock will generate long-term value for the company. These strategies in the past dividends have benefited our shareholders. But given the uncertainty around this unprecedented pandemic, we felt it’s prudent to adjust the company's current capital allocation strategy. First, we reduced capital spending by delaying certain projects and postponing various initiatives. Second, we suspended share buybacks under existing programs. And third, out an abundance of caution, we suspended the dividend. We will continue to review the capital allocation strategy as we always do and plan to determine the appropriate adjustments as we get better visibility into our business. As we look ahead to the next phases of this pandemic, which starts with the reboot of core operations, we have developed various scenarios to inform the ranges of management actions necessary to respond appropriately to them. These scenarios are built around three major variables. First, understanding the impact of the recently unemployed on payer mix is important, including how many people, either maintain existing employer sponsored insurance coverage through COBRA programs, move to coverage from products sold in the exchanges, enroll in Medicaid or become uninsured. Obviously, the timing of the economic recovery and government programs support will determine the outcome of this variable. The second variable relates to the rebound in volume. As directed by federal and state governments, we have suspended certain operations, especially elective business, which is mostly surgical and generally more profitable than medical business. Additionally, emergency room visits have declined significantly during this event, because of general concerns with COVID-19 and sheltering at home policies. Our modeling includes different levels and different timelines for their rebound. We are focused on a reboot plan that places us in the best possible position for success in resuming suspended operations. The reboot will require us to work with the governors on social distancing policies, which we believe will vary by market. We have to understand what physicians need to restart their practices. And finally, we have to respond to patients in a way that reassures them that we have the safe and protected care environment they deserve. We expect to bring on capacity in a conservative manner as markets allow and in the most efficient way possible during the reboot. At this point, we believe the reboot phase will be accomplished across most of the company by the end of the second quarter. The third variable is our cost reduction plan. We have developed three stages of cost reductions with each one being more significant should there be a longer time to recovery. We have already executed on most of the first stage items and now we are implementing aspects of the second stage as we look to enter the reboot phase. The third stage of our plan includes a response to a situation where we see structural changes to revenue. We will be vigilant about determining if this happens. But at this point, we believe it is too early to implement the measures in this third stage. We have demonstrated over the years the ability to respond and adjust operations to various conditions. I have faith in our team and believe that they will once again prove it in the face of this ongoing challenge. As I've said many times in the past, I believe HCA Healthcare is incredibly resilient, because of our dedicated people, the scale we have and the ability to leverage it uniquely to capitalize on business opportunities or address challenges. We believe our resiliency is further enhanced by our diversification of markets, diversification of services and a strong asset base, which can provide a certain level of strategic optionality and flexibility. We have seen it demonstrated over our 50 plus year existence, and I believe we will see it again. In closing, I say with confidence that we will get back to normal in time but we realize it maybe a new normal. Fortunately, I see HCA Healthcare as uniquely positioned to help define the new normal and capitalize on new opportunities. I want to thank our shareholders again for their support of HCA Healthcare. And now, I will turn the call over to Bill for a few more comments.
Bill Rutherford: Okay, great. Thank you, Sam and good morning everyone. Let me provide some additional information. We reported our quarterly results this morning. But as Sam mentioned, the quarter really had two distinct periods to it; the pre-pandemic period, which was January 1st through March 15th; and the last half of March where we began to see the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our reported same facility admission growth of 0.6% in the quarter comprised of about 5% growth through March 15th. Then for the last half of March, we saw an approximate 20% decline in admissions as compared to the prior year period. Almost all of our key volume indicators reflected growth through March 15th, and contractions in the last half of March as compared to the prior year period. Same facility emergency room visits grew about 5% through March 15th, and declined close to 30% in the last half of March as compared to the prior year. Same facility in-patient surgeries grew about 2% through March 15th and declined about 20% in the last half of March. Hospital-based outpatient surgeries grew about 2% through March 15th and declined about 30% in the last half of the month. Generally speaking, almost all volumes statistics were adversely affected and results were comparable among the payer classes. In essence, we saw strong results across the board until the impact of COVID-19 started to materialize in the last half of March. So rather than repeating all of our typical statistics let me discuss briefly what we see as the different phases as we navigate through this event, what we are seeing in April and most importantly, the actions we've taken as a management’s team to guide the company through this period. First, as we think about the pandemic broadly, we see three phases that we believe will likely unfold in the coming months and quarters; a response phase, a restart and recovery phase. We are in the first response phase that was highlighted started with our planning in the first quarter. We then see moving to the restart phase as governmental restrictions on elect to procedures are lifted, as we work with our affiliated physicians on clinical and operational protocols and hopefully, we begin to see some reduction of COVID-19 activity. We are fully focused and have begun our planning for this restart process. We have multiple work streams around securing adequate laboratory testing capabilities, securing additional personal protective equipment, developing and providing surgical support and other important areas. Our focus is to be ready and have the capability to service the needs of our communities as quickly, confidently and safely as possible. We are preparing and will be ready to serve many of the procedures that have been deferred or cancelled.  While much depends on the easing of social and government restrictions, we believe this restart phase will begin towards the last half of the second quarter. After the restart phase, we believe we’ll move into a recovery phase. Our base assumption has us occurring sometime during the summer. There will be many factors that influence how long this phase will last and what the impact will be to our operating results, but we are preparing for a range of scenarios with varying durations of the recovery period. We believe the extent of the COVID-19's impact on the company will depend on many factors. And we cannot predict the future implications this pandemic will have on our business trends at this time. As a result and highlight in our release, we are withdrawing our guidance for 2020. We do believe the impact to the company will be most pronounced during this current response phase as we continue to see volume declines in April. Thus far through April, our in-patient admissions are running about 30% below the prior year. Our emergency room visits are running about 50% below prior year as our in-patient surgeries. Our hospital based outpatient surgeries are running about 70% below our prior year as most elective procedures have been deferred. We have started to see these volume declines stabilize over the past week. We believe we will begin to see some recovery of these volumes as different regions of the country begin to open up during the second half of the quarter. So before I talk about some of our future planning, let me highlight some of the actions and precautionary measures we have already taken to strengthen the company's financial flexibility. First, due to our early planning, we entered into $2 billion short-term credit facility to provide the company with additional liquidity. As of March 31st, we had $3.8 billion of liquidity available under our credit facilities. In addition, we took a series of other actions to strengthen the company's financial position. We suspended our share repurchase program on March 13th. We also began to reduce the company's planned capital expenditures. And at this point, anticipate reducing our capital spending anywhere from $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the remaining part of 2020. We expect this will be accomplished from deferring new project starts, reducing some technology capital spending, as well as reducing some retained capital expenditures. Out of an abundance of caution, we also announced this morning the suspension of our dividend program. We expect to evaluate resumption of the dividend program at a future date. Our operating teams have also implemented a series of cost management strategies, including hiring and travel freezes, reducing our variable cost structure, reducing discretionary spending among many other efforts. In short, we believe the steps that we have implemented enhance the company's financial flexibility as we navigate these unprecedented times. In addition, we are also appreciative of the administration's recognition of the burden this pandemic is having on the nation's healthcare system and the passage of the Cares Act that will help provide some relief to healthcare providers. We anticipate that HCA will receive approximately $4 billion of accelerated Medicare payments provided by the Cares Act, and have already received sustainably all of these funds in the month of April. Stipulated in the act for our hospitals, these monies will be repaid over an eight month time period beginning in August of 2020. During April, we have also received approximately $700 million of funds distributed from the first phase of the public health and social services emergency fund. We are working through providing the necessary at the stations that are part of the distribution process. We understand there are plenty future distributions from this fund, but do not know what future funds, if any, we might receive at this point. The Cares Act also provided deferral of the employer portion of social security payroll taxes, which we estimate to be approximately $75 million a month starting in April of 2020. These deferred amounts will has to be paid in late '21 and '22. And there were certain other aspects of the Cares Act that we believe will provide benefit to the company in the future.  In our planning for potential impacts to the company, we are running different scenarios around major variables, such as payer mix, volume rebound and cost reductions with different durations. Given this is an ongoing and unprecedented public health event there are just too many unknowns to provide any specific estimates of the impact at this time. While it is still early in the process, what we have identified is a cascading range of additional management actions available to take depending on how the business returns. We have already implemented our stage one actions, and we are implementing aspects of our second stages as we begin the restart process. We have a third stage action plan available to execute, if we believe there's a long-term structural change to our revenue. Ultimately, we are confident in HCA's ability to manage through these phases, however they may unfold. So before I turn the call over to Mark, let me close by saying we believe the strength, scale and resiliency of HCA, are longstanding and critical attributes that will serve us well during this time. And it is important to know that our focus remains on the guiding principles that Sam outlined in his comments, including focusing on the safety and welfare of our employees and physicians, providing high quality care to our patients and appropriately managing the financial aspect of the company as we manage through this difficult period of time. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark to open it up for Q&A.
Mark Kimbrough: Well, thanks Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question so that we might give as many as possible in the queue an opportunity to ask questions this morning. Marcella, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask questions. Marcella?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Sandler.
Sarah James: Can you help us better understand what the return to rebooking looks like? So do you have different procedures in place for various geographies as they may not all be affected equally? And how should we think about what that looks like overall across your portfolio?
Sam Hazen: Let me give you a sense of what we're seeing and what we're calling a reboot that's our term. And obviously we have each day implementing different policy decisions about social distancing, elective care when certain businesses start and so forth that's the first point. The second point I would add is that we are working with our physicians to understand their needs as they reboot also. We've got a task force with surgeons and others on our team developing a work stream to assist them. So once we get a better sense of their backlog, a better sense of what's allowed from local government and state government, we’ll be able to start a scheduling process and ensure that we have the resources necessary to address their needs. We also have a work stream around our patients and making sure that we can reassure them that we have a safe environment. We've implemented universal precautions. We've implemented advanced lab testing. We've stepped up our PPE controls and patient cohorting processes. So again we can reassure them. And then finally I think it's about how we bring on capacity. We won't immediately reopen with the existing capacity that we had in the middle of May. So we're determining ways to reopen our capacity very efficiently. We think this will result in some early consolidation of existing operations until we get to the next phase. As I've said in my comments, we're hopeful that the reboot process will be accomplished across all of our markets by the end of the second quarter, but that’s still to be determined based upon some of these other hurdles that have to be cleared.
Operator: And your next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead, Pito Chickering. We’ll move to the next question. We’ve got Joshua Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Joshua Raskin: Good morning. And obviously big thank you to the entire organization and especially the clinical staff at HCA. Question just on cash flow initiatives, and appreciate the comments that both Sam and Bill made. But what are you asking payers to do? And if you look at sort of April as a proxy for what life looks like under the current environment. Sort of how do you think about cash flow needs, and how long does this last until you have to do something external? And again to sort of keeping -- using April as kind of your base?
Bill Rutherford: Well, first as Sam mentioned, we think partnerships was a good, was an important guiding principle for us. And we've been in active discussion with our payers, and we are very pleased with their support during this process. And I think our normal kind of AR process is continuing on there. So we're thankful for their efforts on that. Relative to cash flow, I don't know if April is a proxy. As we've said, we think the second quarter will be probably the most pronounced quarter and then hopefully we will begin to see some recovery throughout the quarter. I think the steps that the company has taken and I mentioned regarding liquidity, position the company very well not only from where we finish the first quarter. But you look at the additional actions that we've taken with the share repurchase program, adjustments to our capital spending. And then as I mentioned with the administration support to the Cares Act, our cash position is very strong from where we sit right now. So, we believe we're in a very strong position from a liquidity standpoint and our focus has really been working through providing the necessary response during this timeframe.
Sam Hazen: Let me add to that Bill, if I may. This is Sam. I would like to acknowledge a number of the payers. In particular, I'd like to acknowledge United Health Group. I think they took a very significant leadership position in relaxing some of their claims edits and so forth and sped up payables in a very significant way, for our company as well as for the whole industry. Also other components of the health insurance industry, I think relaxed aspects of their pre-authorizations and other type of controls to allow for a smoother process in a more efficient turnover of payables on their side as well. And that helped I think the industry as a whole. It helped us as well and we will continue to work with them, I think in a very collaborative way to address issues that we have as well as issues that they have.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi.
Ralph Giacobbe: Just hoping to understand a little more, when you say restart in the back half of 2Q. Sounds like that just mean kind of states opening up and allowing elective procedures back. I don't know if there's any more sort of details you can provide on that. And then when you say recovery in the summer. Can you just give us a little bit of a sense of what that means? Is that just, you'll be sort of fully go to sort of see patients, or should we think of it as we're 60%, 70%, 80% sort of there in terms of volume that's been lost, any willingness to give detail there’d be helpful? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: I don't think we're in a position to give you any kind of percentages at this particular point. When we defined the first phase as the reboot that's basically getting over the hurdles that our state requirements getting over some of the backlog, if you will, on the elective cases that have been postponed and helping our physicians and others get back in business, that's what we mean by the reboot. The recovery period is really difficult to determine at this point. We don't know what the full effect and the damage to the economy are going to be. We don't understand clearly what the uninsured levels are going to be. So we anticipate the effects to vary by market. We also believe that there will be major areas that influence our business results. As we've talked about, we think patient confidence is very important and it's incumbent upon all health systems to create that reassurance that patients can come to a health system as they did just two months ago with confidence and that their safety can be protected. So we have universal precautions, as I mentioned, patient cohorting sufficient PPE, different lab testing capabilities to support this effort. We've also got to manage through the possibility of COVID-19 recurrence, so we're maintaining our surge capacity. So all of this converges on trying to understand a recovery process, and we don't feel like we can predict that at this particular point in time. Some of that is going to be determined about the factors way outside of our control, whether or not there's antiviral therapies that work, or a vaccine that's developed at a timeline that's more current than what's out there today. So all of this is part of what we're calling the recovery phase. So as we get some visibility into the variables associated with that, we can make adjustments in a more informed manner, and that's how we're thinking about it. So we're not in a position at all to estimate percentages or timeline. So that's why we had to pull our guidance, that's why we took some of these other capital preservation tactics to ensure that we have the flexibility to make those adjustments in an inappropriate way.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel.
Scott Fidel: I had a question just on one of the specific reimbursement provisions in the cares funding, which was the 20% bump to the Medicare DRGs for COVID related treatments. And just interested in terms of how you're seeing in terms of discussions, or already in terms of actions that flowing through towards increased reimbursement that are tied to DRGs or not across the other payer classes. So specifically, thinking about is MA plans, commercial plan and then also if Medicaid is doing anything similarly in terms of what they are evaluating on improving the reimbursement rates tied to COVID related treatments? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Scott, this is Bill. Let me try and answer that. One, we are appreciative of that 20% add-on for COVID patients as part of the Cares Act. I don't think in a net-net of all the things we're experienced and that will be that material. I think the most significant part of the Care Acts are the items that are mentioned regarding the accelerated Medicare payments, as well as distributions from the fond and there's other aspects of that that I think will be beneficial for us. So, we are appreciative of that 20% add-on. I can't tell you we've actually seen it yet, but I fully expect it will play out in our claims as we adjudicate it. I think the MA plans will adopt similar reimbursement programs that the federal government does. I do not know about Medicaid programs that yet, we can follow-up on that. But given the COVID activity that we've seen in that amount, I don't view that being that material. I think the most significant things going on with the Cares Act are things that we've been in discussion with the policymakers about understanding just the overall impact to the healthcare system and the additional costs that healthcare providers are experiencing in their preparation, and then just this potential movement with uninsured patients. So that's where our focus has been. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Just want to follow-up maybe on that one a little bit. Can you quantify the other provisions? So the $700 million was good. But I guess the DSH and the sequestration impact? And then as far as that $700 million goes. How and when would you expect to be able to kind of book that? Is that show up as revenue and is it show up in Q2, or does that have to phase in as the year progresses?
Bill Rutherford: So I think the [$7 million] once we go through our processes will show up in revenue in Q2, and we’ll see what other fund distributions may occur. Regarding the other aspects, obviously I mentioned the two significant. The sequestration aspect, we believe will be approximately $100 million for us between the balance of the year at historical Medicare volumes. So that number would be adjusted with our Medicare volumes be in a little shorter than where they historically been. The DSH was really just a continued deferral, which we had already in our plans anticipated that would be deferral. So I think the sequestration, the fund distributions and the accelerated Medicare payments, would be the most significant things we call out.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Frank Morgan: I think you got some news yesterday a number of states that are important to you like Texas and Tennessee were some of the first states that are likely to reopen. So I'm curious what your conversations again like with the state agencies in those states. And then separately, I'd be real curious of the physicians and the surgeons that you talk to. What is their thought process right now in terms of the start back? Are they anxious to go, or are they still hesitant? Any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.
Sam Hazen: I think the health system industry in Tennessee, Texas, Florida, Colorado, all these different states is connected to the government's office. If you think about social distancing and the objective around social distancing, it was to prevent and overrun of the healthcare system. While many of our markets, the initial forecast were to sobering to be honest with you and they have come in significantly less. And so we have ample capacity and we've learned a lot over this past five or six weeks, and that's what we shared with the different governor's offices and local officials' offices is that there has been significant learnings already that have come from this particular experience. There has been increases in lab testing capacity. There has been improvement in PPE supply chain inventory levels. And there is a better understanding by our teams and our physicians on how to manage COVID-19 patients. So all of that is going to serve us well we believe and serve our communities well down the road as we battle this particular event. With respect to our physicians, it's mixed as you would expect. Many of our physicians are eager to go and want to address their backlog. Others still have questions around patient safety, their own personal safety and how all of that is going to be managed. Again, we have a very specific work stream of multidisciplinary team that includes surgeons on there to ensure that we have the right procedures in place to deal generally with the issues that we have. But we're excited about the reopening in Texas. We're excited about Tennessee and we anticipate other states starting to relax some of these procedures and policies just as we mentioned over the course of the next few weeks, allowing us to start back on some of the care that's needed in the community. So we'll just have to wait and see how all that ramps up again. It's variable and we'll just have to process it Frank and hopefully, have it behind us at the end of the second quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from UBS.
Whit Mayo: Sam, can you maybe just go back and elaborate a little bit more on the comments you made around structural changes? Any thoughts on how you're thinking about it? I know it's really a big multi-dimensional topic? And then if you could comment on the aspects of the Cares Act that you said might provide long-term benefits, Bill. Just curious what you're referencing? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: I'll let Bill answer the question on the Cares Act. When we think about structure, we're thinking about the demand side of the equation and the supply side of the equation. And on the demand side, we're trying to judge fundamentally has there been a demand curve shift as a result of the COVID-19. By that, we mean have income levels drop because of unemployment and uninsured that starts to influence buying patterns and healthcare services demand. Do patient preferences, with respect to concerns about COVID-19 cause patients to avoid the health system? Has telemedicine structurally changed certain buying patterns? We don't have a sense of that yet, but those are variables that we're trying to understand. On the supply side, we're trying to understand what happens with certain providers. Will we actually exit the marketplace and start to again think about a shift in the supply curve? Will physician changes occur and create changes to the supply side of the equation? There could be government regulations that create implications also on the supply side. Many of these we think create opportunities for HCA as we move forward. And so those are the big structural variables with that we're trying to study, stay close to, have responses in our different phases of our plans, allowing us to respond appropriately and capitalized as well on opportunities as they develop.
Bill Rutherford: On the Cares Act, if I said long-term, I didn't mean long-term. I think we view the Cares Act activity that we've seen really being more immediate term. Clearly, through the accelerated payment program we received that was in a short-term item to recognize the impact to the industry. And we know those funds have to be repaid starting in August over an eight month period of time. I think the distributions from the public health fund is a great for start and is recognition of the impact on there. So we see most of the Cares Act activity being much more of an immediate term impact to recognize the disruption that's going on with healthcare providers across the country.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: Just one clarification to your answer to Whit, there's been some talk about switching from in patient outpatient more as a result of all this or outpatient into ASCs. I'm wondering about your comment there? And then also on your cost reduction program, it sounds like the first two pages are well in hand and then the third one is sort of on hold if things continue at a tough pace. Is there any way to quantify at all how much order of magnitude on the savings that you're trying to get in those programs?
Sam Hazen: Let me answer the first question, I’ll let Bill answer the second question, A.J. We do have substitute settings as a variable on the demand side that we're studying. Does that mean our women's hospitals are across the organization are better positioned than commingled women's services we have across many of HCA markets dedicated women's hospitals that are separately controlled, if you will and does that create advantage for us in obstetric services? Possibly. Will we see more activity in ambulatory surgery centers? Again, that's a possibility. But it's incumbent upon us in our hospitals to create the same kind of safe circumstances, safe environment for outpatient surgical patients, outpatient cardiology patients and so forth. But substitute settings are something that we are studying, and we are thinking about as we go through this transition. And obviously, we believe we're already well prepared to respond to those. And again, it may create opportunities down the road, but there are levels of risk as well. So we have to balance all of that out. But we think again HCA's diversification of services, diversification of facilities, diversification of markets give us opportunities to navigate through that transition better than most.
Bill Rutherford: On the cost side, I think it's too early to try to quantify the impact of all of these. Clearly, we identified some of the stage one actions, which is really more focused around some of our immediate discretionary spending in our stage two that we're in. Now as we begin to reboot process basically goes deeper into our cost structure, mostly around discretionary spend giving our commitment to our employees. And then you look at the stage three, which we really aren't implementing yet but we'll be prepared to if the circumstances require. We really get more into some of the changes to our fixed cost structure and going deeper into our cost side. But all of that and we'll pay some will be dependent on how we see the volume returning as we go through these different phases.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: I guess the question is for either Sam or Bill. You guys have both been at the company through the past couple of recessions. So as we think about, you just mentioned diversification. How are you thinking about the ability of HCA to deliver growth as you had in past market pullbacks? And also more specifically, there's a lot of fear right now about Texas, Houston's a 10% margin for you guys. What do you see there or how are you thinking about the oil industry’s impact on your business?
Sam Hazen: Well, obviously this crisis is not a parallel necessarily to any other recession that we've been through. It's got public health connected to it as well as economy. And the third variable, as you just mentioned, is energy. So we have three pressure points, if you will, that we're trying to sort out. I don't know that we have a read on the energy implications for Texas at this particular point in time. Again, Texas is more diversified today than it's ever been. Obviously, energy in that particular industry plays a huge part in the economy but not as much as it did 10 years ago and clearly not as much as it did 20 years ago. For us, we have 43 markets in the U. S. Texas is clearly significant and we will continue to pay attention to those detail. But across the portfolios, one market in Huston is less than 10% of the company and won't necessarily fully influence the company's results. But those are difficult for us to ascertain at this point in time and we really don't have any visibility into it and cannot speak to the implications just yet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Gary Taylor: Good morning, guys. I would like to add my thanks to HCA's leadership and its clinicians out there in the real world managing through this earnings and EBITDA side. I think the U.S. is really fortunate to have companies like yours for sure, so we really appreciate you. At this point, I just have a couple of items for Bill, just to clarify. On the $4 billion of accelerated Medicare payments for April, I presume that's a cash flow only item not a P&L item. And then on the $75 million a month of FICA tax deferrals. Is that also cash flow only since you ultimately have to pay, will you still be accruing that in that as we see you buying, or is it EBITDA benefit for 2020?
Bill Rutherford: Gary, first thanks for your comments. And yes, you're correct on both of those. They're cash flow items only. There will be no P&L impact of the accelerated Medicare payments or the deferral of the FICA taxes. We will continue to accrue the expenses associated with the employer sponsor FICA taxes or P&L, it just the payment gets deferred and the accelerated payments will just go on the balance sheet until we go through the repayment cycles.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.
Steven Valiquette: Good morning everyone. And let me also commend you and all the work that you do on the pandemic. So couple of questions here, just on the first wave of $30 billion in industry leading data, once we get beyond that. When we think about remaining $70 million out of the total $100 billion from the Cares Act, I think you mentioned that the visibility and that's still not clear at the moment on timing, et cetera. But do you have any color at least on formulate that we have might be paid out. Is it still a think possibly going to be tied to the Medicare fee for service formula? I know the AHA was also talking about a per bed amount, $25,000 previously that could change. I’m curious about the formula there. And the second quick follow up, which is around your payer mix comments in your prepared remarks and the potential for people to move from commercial health insurance to exchanges or Medicaid. I guess just based on the timing of that sort of change. I'm curious if that’s something that might be more impactful this year in 2020, or would that be something that maybe a bigger variable for 2021 as we think about that?
Bill Rutherford: At the end of the day, we do not have the visibility into the formula of the distribution of the remaining funds. We stay connected. We have given our views of different fomulas. We understand there is a lot of constituencies that are also doing the same. So as of today, we just don't know what that formula will be. We understand there’s some discussions on different metrics that will be tie to either going disproportionately to certain areas of the country and/or considering uninsured or considering some disruptions on there. We think position we've outlined is that almost every institution is impacted regardless of the number of COVID patients. So we'll just have to wait to see on that. I think on the payer mix changes, you're right, that is obviously an important variable that we are modeling. I think today is different maybe than in past eras were, because we have some states that have expanded in Medicaid and that we have subsidies available for people to purchase coverage in the health insurance exchanges. Those are two different dynamics today than were in place the last time we went through an economic cycle. So we'll have to see how that plays out. My sense is those are longer term implications, much more than they are shorter terms. Even as COBRA gets extended and as we are working with various community agencies to try to help people understand the potential coverage options in the event they find themselves unemployed for a period of time. So I do believe that will be a longer term impact, and we'll just have to wait to see how that plays out.
Sam Hazen: Steven, thank you so much. Marcella, I think we're finished with the call. Listen, I want to again thank everyone for joining us today. Those of you who are shareholders of the company on the call, I want to thank you for your support of the company. And I will be around obviously to answer additional questions that you might have. So feel free to give me a call. Have a wonderful week. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the HCA Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Kimbrough: Kevin, thank you so much. Good morning, and welcome to everybody on the call today and our webcast. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO, which will provide comments on the company's results for the fourth quarter. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everybody that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that may be expressed today. More information on forward-looking statements and these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding gains and losses on facilities, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in today's fourth quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. I will now turn the call over to Sam.
Samuel Hazen: All right. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We finished the year with strong fourth quarter results that were above our expectations. Solid volume increases, strong revenue growth and good expense management drove this quarter's results. Revenue increased on a year-over-year basis by 10% to $13.5 billion. This increase was driven again this quarter by a combination of strong same-facilities volume growth and our recent acquisitions. On a same-facilities basis, revenue increased by 6%, which was driven by 4.7% growth in inpatient admissions and 5% growth in equivalent admissions.  We saw growth across most service categories and broadly across most markets in the company. To highlight a few additional service categories, emergency room visits grew 6.7%, and total surgeries grew around 2% with roughly equal growth in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. We have now grown inpatient admissions in 23 consecutive quarters. This remarkable consistency reflects positive market forces across our diversified portfolio, a robust growth agenda, significant capital spending and strong execution by our people. The growth in revenue translated into strong earnings for the quarter with diluted earnings per share of $3.09. Adjusted EBITDA grew 9.2% to over $2.7 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin at 20.3%. 2019 was another successful year for HCA Healthcare. The company's results, which improved across most key performance metrics, reflected both the steadfast commitment we have to our mission and our disciplined operational culture. Across our networks, we took care of more than 35 million patients in 2019, a record level of patient volumes. We spent $4.1 billion in capital expenditures. About 1/2 were for routine needs, and the balance were investments needed to support our growth agenda. The strategic investments we made in our business to expand our network and improve our clinical capabilities made it easier for patients to receive high-quality, convenient patient care in an HCA Healthcare facility. As we look to the future, we believe the fundamentals in our markets remain strong with growing demand for healthcare services. This, coupled with the continued improvement and the competitive positioning of our local health care systems, gives us confidence as we move into 2020. Inpatient market share in 2019 grew by 38 basis points as compared to 2018 to over 26%, reflecting the improvement. As indicated in our earnings release, our Board of Directors has authorized an additional share repurchase program for up to $2 billion of the company's outstanding shares. Additionally, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend by 7.5% to $0.43 per share. In closing, I want to thank our employees and our physicians for the great work they do every day to take care of our patients. We are proud of their accomplishments. Together with our employees and physicians, we connect our local networks with the unique enterprise capabilities and scale of HCA Healthcare to make a difference in the communities we serve. We believe this approach allows us to improve more lives in more ways and advance the delivery of health care services. With that, let me turn the call over to Bill for more details on the quarter's results and our guidance for 2020.
William Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and then briefly discuss our 2020 guidance. As Sam mentioned, all of our stats for the quarter were solid. We were pleased with the quarter and full year results, so let me provide you with some additional information. During the fourth quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions increased 4.3%, and equivalent admissions increased 5%. This includes both traditional and Managed Medicare. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 5.1%, and equivalent admissions increased 4.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Our same-facility managed care admissions increased 4.7%, and equivalent admissions increased 4.8% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Our same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 6.8%, and equivalent admissions increased 6.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 6.7% in the quarter. Our level 1 through 3 visits increased 8%, while our higher-acuity level 4 and 5 visits increased 5.3% over the prior year. In addition, admissions through the emergency room increased 4.7% over the prior year.  Same facility net revenue per equivalent admission grew 1.1% over the prior year in the quarter. Our net revenue per equivalent admission growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 of 4.4% was one of the strongest we have seen since 2014. Also, our acuity growth was lower than trend due to our medical admission growth of 5.9%, which outpaced our surgical admission growth of about 2%. For full year 2019, our same-facility net revenue per equivalent admission has grown 2.3%, which is in line with our guidance range for the year. Our same-facility inpatient net revenue grew 6.5% in the quarter, and our same-facility outpatient net revenue grew 5.8% in the quarter. So let me move on to operating expenses. Even with a more moderate revenue per equivalent admission growth, our costs were managed very well. Our same-facility operating expenses per equivalent admission grew just 0.8% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and our same-facility adjusted EBITDA margins increased 20 basis points in the quarter. Our same-facility labor cost per equivalent admission increased 1.3% in the quarter. Our same-facility average hourly rate grew 2.7%, and we continue to see labor productivity improvements. Same-facility supply cost per equivalent admission grew 1.8% over the prior year period. Same-facility other operating expenses per equivalent admission declined 0.4% compared to the prior year. So let me take a moment to talk about cash flow and earnings per share. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter, increasing to $2.5 billion versus $2.175 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2019, cash flow from operations was $7.6 billion or an increase of $841 million from $6.76 billion last year. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $1.274 billion and for the year increased to $4.158 billion.  During the fourth quarter, we paid $272 million to repurchase 2.069 million shares. During the year, we repurchased 7.949 million shares at a cost of $1.03 billion and had $1.24 billion of the 2019 repurchase authorization remaining as of December 31, 2019. At the end of the quarter, we had $3.2 billion available under our revolving credit facilities, and our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 3.42x. Earnings per share, excluding gains on sale of facilities, was $3.09 in the fourth quarter of this year versus $2.99 in the fourth quarter last year. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a $67 million or $0.19 per diluted share favorable tax benefit, as was noted in our release this morning. So that, I will move on into a discussion about our 2020 guidance. We highlighted our 2020 guidance in our earnings release this morning. We estimate our 2020 consolidated revenues should range between $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to range between $10.25 billion and $10.65 billion. Within our revenue estimates, we assume same-facility equivalent admissions will grow between 2% and 3% for the year and same-facility revenue per equivalent admission to also grow between 2% and 3% for 2020. We anticipate same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission growth of approximately 2% to 3%. Our diluted shares are projected to be approximately 342 million shares for the year, and earnings per diluted share guidance for 2020 is projected to be between $11.30 and $12.10.  Relative to other aspects of our guidance. We anticipate cash flow from operations to be between $7.6 billion and $8 billion. We anticipate capital spending between $4 billion and $4.2 billion. We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.8 billion and interest expense to be slightly below $1.8 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. Sam mentioned in his comments we also announced an increase of our quarterly dividend from $0.40 to $0.43 per share and authorized an additional $2 billion share repurchase program. Both of these are a reflection of management's belief in the long-term performance of the company, the confidence we have and the strength of our cash flow and our commitment to a balanced allocation of capital. So that concludes my remarks. Let me turn it back over to Mark to open it up for questions and answers.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Bill. Kevin, you can now provide instructions for those on the call who wish to ask questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. 
Philip Chickering: A question for you on CapEx. CapEx as a percent of revenue guidance looks to be about 7.5% in 2020 versus 8.1% in 2019. As you think about CapEx over the next two, three years, do you think CapEx continues to drift down? And are you able to facilitate the same level of EBITDA growth? Or asked differently, what is the balance between CapEx spend versus EBITDA growth?
William Rutherford: Thanks, Pito. So yes. When we look at capital, keeping a relatively flat in our guidance for 2020, we look at it as a percentage of our cash flow from operations. And with the strength of the cash flow, I think this current level of $4 billion to $4.2 billion is a good planning estimate for us. We continue to see opportunities to deploy capital to facilitate our growth, either through capacity expansion or network development or deepen program capability. So I think as long as we continue to see the growth of our cash flow, good capital opportunities, nice growth of our returns on invested capital that we think it's an important component of our ability to generate future growth.
Samuel Hazen: Yes. Let me add to that, Bill. It's Sam, Pito. I think in 2019, we had some early-stage capital investments that we knew we're going to have to make with our Mission acquisition and our Savannah acquisition, and that tended to be earlier in our model. And so there was some acceleration in those items, and that lifted up our CapExes a little bit as a percent of revenue, and that's why it's dialed back. As Bill said, we continue to believe we have opportunities in our existing markets organically to deploy capital and deal with growth opportunity, competitive positioning and even capacity constraints. In the face of all of these new beds that we've added over the years, our occupancy levels continue to go up. And so that's really encouraging that our planning and the execution underneath it is occurring at the levels that we had hoped. And so that's where we are at this particular point with our capital.
Operator: We will now go to Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan: A question about the guidance. When you think about the high end of that range, clearly higher than it has been in the past, are there any particular things that you could call out that may be the primary driver to getting the high end of that growth? And I guess specifically, what are you factoring in for the reentry into the network in Las Vegas? And then what about the DSH cuts that I think have been postponed through May of '20? Where do you have that in the -- how do you have that factored into guidance for the year?
William Rutherford: Yes, Frank. This is Bill. Let me take that and talk about our guidance overall. As you know, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, it's about 6% growth rate. At the high point, it's at 8%. And that's before reflecting any adjustment for the payer settlement we had in 2019, which add roughly about 1% of those growth rates. I think that's consistent with our commentary that we had in the third quarter that we continue to see momentum in the marketplace, and that is allowing us to perform from the core operations at the top end of our long-term guidance, and we think acquisitions will continue to contribute growth for us. We estimate about 1%, a little bit north of 1% for acquisitions. So when we look at in totality, the range accounts for a number of those variables. We continue to see volume opportunities as we see demand and market share capabilities. And I think that 6% to 8% on an as-reported basis, probably 7% to 9% when you adjust for the payer settlement is a good planning range for us.
Samuel Hazen: And then, Frank, with respect -- this is Sam. With respect to the Las Vegas situation with Sierra, we do see that particular contract being a material change in our strategic dynamics in that market, but the magnitude of it for the company as a whole is not material. And Las Vegas is part of a diversified portfolio inside of HCA and is a very significant market for us and is doing incredibly well without the Sierra contract, and we have significant investments going into the market that are dealing with the population growth that's occurring in that market as well as now access to more lives. So we're very excited about it. We think it's reflective of the strategic partnerships that we have with our payers and trying to figure out ways to deliver value to them, and we're excited about the prospects of being in the Sierra relationship in Las Vegas.
William Rutherford: And then, Frank, on your DSH cuts, we look at that in the context of our overall Medicare rate increase. As we've talked about before, we think we're in a favorable Medicare rate update, 2.5% to 3%. We are not forecasting any material Medicaid DSH cuts at this point in time, so we'll just have to wait to see how that dialogue continues going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: I wanted to follow up on the pricing commentary from earlier. It sounded like you were saying that most of it, in your view, was just kind of from a mix perspective. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the commercial side? Obviously, that numbers are moving around a lot. So how did that impact pricing, what pricing you're getting in commercial? And then, two, did flu have any impact either on the volume or the pricing in the quarter?
Samuel Hazen: Kevin, this is Sam. I think we're in a really good position with our contracting strategies with the commercial payer marketplace. And as we just mentioned, we've gained access to Sierra in Las Vegas which opens up more commercial lives for us as a system. But in general, we're roughly 85% contracted for 2020 and almost 2/3 contracted for 2021 and about 1/3 contracted for 2022 in generally consistent terms across our portfolio.  As it relates to the revenue per unit in the quarter, our commercial revenue per unit was reflective of sort of the overall trend. It was underneath maybe our composite. And that was due, we think, to the lower medical book that Bill alluded to and also some outpatient growth in certain areas which starts to mess with the number a little bit. But nonetheless, our commercial book is doing about what we thought, and we saw great growth in high-end services with neonatal services, with trauma services, orthopedic services, cardiovascular. So our approach to delivering high-quality, complex services is yielding value. It was offset a little bit. That's why we had a little bit more volume in the quarter because of the medical growth that we saw in the fourth quarter, and that creates a net effect of the numbers we report. That also affects our cost, as Bill alluded to. And that's why we were able to create, on a per-unit basis, margin expansion, in addition to sort of the overall growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice of Crédit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: Let me just maybe focus in on your -- if your debt to EBITDA is down at 3.4, that's sort of toward the low end of -- or even maybe slightly below the low end of your, I think, 3.5 to 4.5 target. If I think about the different buckets of where you can deploy capital, you're raising the dividend. You've re-upped the buyback, but it's been pretty steady in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion annual range. You've got -- you've been doing some tuck-ins and then a few larger deals, and then there's been steady capital deployment, but I don't know whether some of these deals or what's your comment on Vegas or something opens up new opportunities. So I guess I'm leading up to asking, can you go through each of those buckets and say where the priorities are? Has there been any evolution on any of that in terms of maybe tuck-in deals with the prospects for doing bigger deals or whatever? Give us some update on that.
Samuel Hazen: Sure.
William Rutherford: Yes. A.J., this is Bill. Let me start and Sam can add on. So you're right. Our leverage ratio at 3.42% is the lowest we've run since before the LBO. We're fortunate we did finish the year stronger than originally anticipated. We continue to look at that long-term range and give a lot of thought, too. I think ultimately gives the company an incredible amount of flexibility, and we continue to assess all 3 areas that you talk about. First is to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions. We do expect a couple of smaller acquisitions that are in the pipeline to be completed. We did complete the acquisition of Galen School of Nursing in January. And as you mentioned and we've mentioned before, we are usually evaluating a couple of larger acquisition opportunities at any particular time. It's hard to call exactly when and if they might be completed, but we have the balance sheet capacity to execute on these, if they come to fruition. And also, as you mentioned, second, we continue to evaluate capital investment opportunities that will provide growth. We've talked about that earlier, either through expand capacity, expand our network, improve our competitive positioning. Interesting, in 2019, we brought on over 1,000 new inpatient beds. And as Sam mentioned, we're running one of the highest occupancies we've run in quite some time. So we continue to see capital investment opportunities in the market. And then, third, as we mentioned in the release, we do have a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. That's on top of the $1.2 billion remaining on our 2019 authorization. And although the program has no specific time limit, there are a lot of factors that influences our timing and pacing on this and the quarterly dividend. So I think when I step back, we've got a pretty long track record of a balanced and I think disciplined capital purchase. As we continue to see acquisition opportunities, we have the capability to do that. As we see capital investment opportunities and then manage the balance sheet through the share repurchase program is all part of our capital strategy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel of Stephens.
Scott Fidel: My question is just on, obviously, I know you don't give quarterly guidance. But just thinking about the seasonality of EBITDA margins in 2020 and just anything maybe that you'd want to call out, if necessary, as it relates to sort of workday mix and then just also with sort of the progression of the margin realization on some of the acquisitions last year or for 2019. Just in general, how we should think about sort of year-over-year comps for margins on a quarterly basis over the course of the year.
William Rutherford: Thanks, Scott. This is Bill. Two things on that. You're right. We don't give quarterly guidance, but we'll make a quick note. And remember that our first quarter of 2019 was an extremely strong quarter for us, not only from operational performance, but we did record the payer settlement in the first quarter. So that's the only note I would tell you -- I would say. Outside of that, our quarterly spread is probably consistent with our recent trends. We are pleased with the acquisitions and their continued progression, and we saw that throughout 2019. Relative to margins, we talked about before, on a full year basis, they were running high teens, but we saw those improve throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, they were hovering just above 10%. So we expect those margins to continue to evolve in 2020. And then other than that, I would say the net -- our normal progression would be what our trends have been.
Samuel Hazen: Just a clarification. I think you said high teens. I think you meant high single digits.
William Rutherford: High single digits, yes. I'm sorry on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi.
Ralph Giacobbe: The volume stack obviously popped out. Can you give us a little more in terms of what you attribute the strength to, both sort of on, I guess, a macro level and then specific to your initiatives in markets? And I want to go back to sort of your prepared remarks and commentary around better competitive positioning, hoping you could flesh that out a little bit. Is that just related to sort of your access strategies? Or is that more a reflection of the competitiveness in your market where some of the -- some of your peers maybe are struggling a little more? Just some help on that.
William Rutherford: Thank you, Ralph. Sam, you want to start?
Samuel Hazen: Yes. I think the first point I would make is we believe and we've said this and we continue to believe it and we're seeing evidence even in 2019 that there's growing demand for health care services in HCA's markets. And we're very protective of our portfolio for a reason, and part of that is due to the fact that we're trying to pick markets that we believe have macro trends that are supportive of a growth agenda. So that's number one. When you look at -- the second point I would suggest is that we have a model that we believe is very competitive and responsive to the marketplace and responds to those growth opportunities, responds to competitive dynamics and really responds to our stakeholders: our patients, our physicians and our employees and really the community, so four key stakeholders. And the first point is really about building out broader and more clinically capable networks. We've talked about we want our networks to be conveniently located, easy for the patient to access and navigate, have different price points and then fundamentally our one-stop shops as a system with comprehensive service lines, so our patients can obtain all their health care inside of HCA network. So we've added 2 facility offerings. This past year, we added with an acquisition of an urgent care center, we added with a couple of acquisitions of ambulatory surgery centers, and then we developed a number of outpatient facilities, including freestanding emergency rooms, urgent care centers, physician clinics and so forth. So we now have more than 2,000 sites of care that are connected to our 185 hospitals. They work as a system. We still have opportunities to have them work more effectively as a system and create better value for the patient, better value for our payers and so forth. The second key part, and this is a very important part, HCA Healthcare is a physician-friendly organization. We have significant leadership talent on the physician side. We are fundamentally centered around providing our physicians with the tools that are necessary for them to deliver high-quality care, so we give them voice. We create an efficient environment. We make sure they have the clinical specialties and nursing care that are very important to them, and we offer them an opportunity to hitch their wagon to a system that can grow. And so over the past number of years, we've grown our physicians at about 1.5% to 2% per year. Again, in 2019, we grew our physicians at 1.5%., adding to the capabilities and the complement of specialists that we need. On top of that, our physician engagement in 2019 was at an all-time high. And so I want to take the opportunity on this call to thank our physicians for what they do for our patients, again, and thank them for their commitment to HCA. And then the last thing I will tell you that's unique about HCA and why we believe we can create competitive advantage is we have a different set of enterprise capabilities in most of our local competitors. We have scale on the back end with respect to administrative functions that allows us to create a very efficient per-patient administrative cost. The second thing we have is investment capabilities. Bill has already alluded to the fact that we use our financial resources to support our agenda, our growth agenda, our clinical improvement agenda and our people agenda, where we're investing heavily in our people and our clinical improvement. And then we're able to leverage best practices.  We have this incredible laboratory of people trying to take care of patients more effectively, more efficiently. And when we find a solution that we think has application across the company, we will move that solution through our organizational apparatus to our different facilities so that we can create systematic improvement in patient care and efficiency. Examples of that are our graduate medical education programs, our Sarah Cannon Research Institute. I can go down our trauma programs. All of these things are connected to this opportunity for us to leverage, and we think that is part of why our competitive positioning has improved and yielded the market share gains that I alluded to. So that would be sort of our approach and our belief as we look to the future. Obviously, there's a lot of discussion about the health care industry, but we think we're uniquely qualified to respond to those dynamics in a way that's productive for our organization and really responsive to the market dynamics.
Operator: Our next question comes from Whit Mayo of UBS.
Benjamin Mayo: Maybe I'll just follow up, Sam, on your comments there about your physician strategy. Is there anything changing with your hospital coverage or your outsourcing strategy? I mean you talk a lot about the evolving physician strategy, but has anything changed as you kind of marry your physician needs with your capital strategy this year as I sort of hear you talk about high-cost complex, service development, trauma, et cetera? Does that just maybe influence how you think about anesthesiology or anything along those lines?
Samuel Hazen: Whit, this is Sam again. On hospital-based physicians, we have a multifaceted approach to hospital-based physicians. In critical care medicine, as an example, in our intensive care units, and this has been a part of our efficiencies that we've talked about in the past, we have, I think, the largest intensive critical care medicine group in the country. They are deployed across a number of our facilities. We're able to leverage their learnings, some of our data to support better critical care management. We're trying to figure out how to use that platform for advancing telemedicine and critical care to support rural hospitals and to support some of our other facilities. That's one example. The second thing would be on pathology. We have a very large pathology group that provide pathology services across HCA, not in every facility, but a number of facilities and growing.  With respect to emergency room and anesthesia and hospitals, we have a mixed solution there. We contract largely with outside organizations, national organizations, in many instances, in some local organizations. We do have some employment models there as well. We'll continue to evaluate whether or not it makes sense for us to contract or to employ. We have the wherewithal to do both. And we work with our contracted providers very effectively to deliver high-quality, efficient care and respond to the marketplace. So that model is evolving a little bit, as you know. And as it evolves, we will adjust appropriately. But hospital-based physicians are a key part of our physician strategy. They're very important to patient care. They're very important to patient satisfaction. They're very important to the efficiencies that we have. And so we have strategic relationships, again, locally, at a national level and then through our employee model. And we will continue to sort that out as the years progress.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Tanal: I guess I had two quick ones. One was on the recently acquired hospitals. The last, around the Medicare cost reports, I think, put the EBITDA margins on a 4-wall basis around 6-or-so percent. Sounds like you're saying high singles, maybe not too different. So first, just wondering where you think that could go over time. And then more about the quarter. I was hoping to just get a little bit of clarity around the flu, the impact that you guys would estimate on admissions, revenue per adjusted admission and EBITDA and maybe tying those comments into revenue per adjusted admission with a comment on the acuity index where that shook out for the quarter and maybe even same-store revenue per adjusted admission for the commercial book. I know you've provided that in the past, just to help us think about that number there.
Samuel Hazen: All right. Steve, thanks. Steve, let me try to cover some of those. First on the acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, at least attempted to, the acquisitions for the full year were running at the high single-digit margin level. We saw those improved throughout the year and hover just over 10% in the fourth quarter. We think, over time, we can get those to a reasonable margin level. This would be basically in the mid-teen range. I think all of the acquisitions we've talked about before will take up as a multiyear prong for us. So over time, we think we can continue to see margin improvement there.  On the flu. The flu was mostly an outpatient impact for us during the quarter. With our emergency room business, we think probably 150, 170 basis points growth in that emergency room visit volume that we reported, the 6.7%. Very little effect on our inpatient admissions for the quarter. Our best estimate in the quarter is relatively nominal impact on the flu on our inpatient admissions. And I don't think it has much impact at all, if we look at the other kind of financial statistics, both either on a revenue, revenue per unit or an earnings standpoint. More a volume standpoint as we saw activity in our emergency rooms.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Valiquette of Barclays.
Andrew Mok: This is Andrew Mok on for Steve. During January, you've finalized your acquisition of the Galan College of Nursing. Can you speak to the strategic benefit from a partnership like that in terms of building a pipeline of nursing labor to feed into your hospitals? Is that an area where we should continue to expect additional investments? And secondly, can you give us an update on the labor and wage trends you're seeing in your end markets, including what's embedded in your 2020 outlook?
William Rutherford: Galan School of Nursing here.
Samuel Hazen: Okay. Well, first of all, we're very excited about the acquisition of the Galan School of Nursing. They have a tremendous leadership in Mark Vogt, number one. Number two, their culture aligns with HCA's culture in a very significant way. So that was part of the appeal. The second thing that we learned when we studied that organization is they have a scalable model. And when you connect that scalable model with the unique platform of HCA, we think we can create a nursing school education program that starts to scale up across most of our major markets. So we're in the final stages of building a multiyear plan to expand Galen School of Nursing and integrate that component of education with a robust agenda we have for clinical education and nursing support for our existing nurses, hopefully creating both a pipeline and a continuous education cycle inside of HCA so that our nurses are more capable of delivering high-quality care but also have more opportunities for growth. And we think that's a winning formula for us.  So the investment requirements to do that are modest. They're not significant. It's really about getting the right faculty, the right administrative leadership and so forth, and the team is working on that as we speak. But we're very excited about what the education opportunities for the Galen School of Nursing can do for HCA. And again, that parallels what we're doing with graduate medical education today for physicians inside of HCA. Both of these components, we think, provide a tremendous community benefit for our communities in that we're creating a supply of caregivers to deal with some challenges that exist on a macro level in many markets. As it relates to labor costs, in general, we're anticipating 2020 to be consistent with what we've seen over the past few years. I think HCA has been able to respond to market dynamics very effectively with our wage and compensation programs. We've recently enhanced our living wage policy program as an organization to respond to certain dynamics on that front. And then with respect to nursing, we've been able to respond to market dynamics effectively and keep our wage trends within a level that we think are consistent with where we have guided number one but responsive to what's going on in the market. So we fully anticipate a continuation of past trends in our model for 2020.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research.
Joshua Raskin: I wanted to ask sort of again on the leverage and just push a little bit. You guys are below your long-term targets at sort of 3.4. And if I kind of just run out share buybacks at current levels, good dividend that you've talked about, the share repurchase -- I'm sorry, the CapEx guidance that you've given. And I know acquisitions are lumpy and difficult to time, et cetera, but you'll be closer to 3 than 3.5 by the end of the year. So is there a point where there's sort of pressure to deploy more capital? And I guess,is there an opportunity maybe for an accelerated buyback or a special dividend, things that you guys have thought about in the past for 2020?
William Rutherford: Josh, thanks. Yes, this is Bill. Let me try to talk about that. I think we're very fortunate to have the ratio where it is. Ultimately, it gives the company, I think, a lot of flexibility into the future. I think that acquisitions, if they materialize, could affect that. We think the increase in the share repurchase program we're anticipating for 2020, we will continue to evaluate that. I don't think it puts any pressure towards your question to us. It just gives us opportunity, I think, to continue the growth trajectory of HCA, either through acquisitions or capital and share repurchase program. I think it will likely be a combination of all 3 of those as it has been in the past going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Newshel of Evercore ISI.
Michael Newshel: I just want to get your latest view on the price transparency regulation finalized by CMS, how it might influence payer negotiations and also market share. And are there like interesting like practical technology challenges be ready for 2021 there? Or do you think the core challenges are just going to likely delay this?
Samuel Hazen: This is Sam. The pricing transparency, as we've said in the past, is a policy that we're supportive of as it relates to protecting the patient. And so we believe that any transparency policy that supports the patient getting information when they can in advance of their care on their co-pay deductibles and so forth is something that we can support. As it relates to our commercial pricing contract, we're not supportive of that. We don't think it necessarily will accomplish what others are saying it will accomplish, number one. Then number two, we think it is very complicated for a patient to discern and would not necessarily accomplish the patient objectives that we think are really the intentions of many people's desire here. And then finally, it will be administratively difficult and complicated, and a lot of systems won't have the capability to put those pricing arrangements forward. So that is a factor. We don't know exactly how this is going to shake out. There are a couple of approaches that the federal government has pursued, and we'll just have to wait and see how it develops. I don't anticipate it creating any significant issue for us.  With respect to contracting, we think it just creates, like I said, confusion with the patient more than anything else. HCA is positioned, we believe, well with our networks. We are positioned well, we believe, from a pricing standpoint across most of our markets, and we don't anticipate that being a major issue for us. It's just that it does create a lot of confusion.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: A couple of follow-ups for me. First, I just wanted to see if I can get a little more color on the seasonality of 2020. I know you pointed, Bill, to the tough comp in Q1, which I calculated, I think, like 13% core EBITDA growth. So obviously, a great quarter, and then clearly, a much easier comp in Q2 where the core was closer to flat. So I was hoping you might give us some additional color here on the growth for the 2 quarters, basically asking whether you see the growth in Q1 and Q2 being only slightly different than the full year directionally. Or should we think as much as maybe flat year-over-year in Q1 might be a reasonable target, just given how strong that comp was, and maybe it gets made up in Q2?
William Rutherford: Yes. Justin, this is Bill. Without giving specific quarterly guidance because I think if I go back to my earlier comment, our historical trends would be our best guide on there. And we're always going to be subject to some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations on there. If I go back to 2019, what we said at the end of the second quarter is that our year-to-date results were more reflective of what we thought our trend was going to be. And indeed, that was the case. So in essence, I think you -- it's hard to really call 1 quarter to the other. I think over a couple of the quarters, we still think the core fundamentals will be there. And again, last year does pose a couple of difficult comps for us, both in the first quarter and then in the second quarter. So I tend -- would look at it more on a year-to-date basis than I would quarter by quarter. And I think if you can kind of normalize through that noise, I think our historical trend would be our best guide going forward.
Justin Lake: Got it. And then, Sam, if I could just squeeze in a second one. You made -- you talked about the benefit of getting back in network with Sierra in Vegas, and I was just hoping if you can give a little more color there in terms of given how quickly do you think the -- given the physician referral patterns have been in place for a while, how quickly do you think those can change to drive volumes to HCA? And then talk to any dilution potentially because I know you guys had some better payers, better paying volumes that have shifted over to you over time, how much those might shift out and dilute some of that benefit.
Samuel Hazen: Well, let me say again, Las Vegas is a very important market to HCA. We're making significant investments in a number of our facilities, and we continue to look for opportunities to invest. I think a lot of our medical staff participates in the Sierra contract. And the opportunity to sort of repatriate them, for lack of a better term, into our facilities is what we're working on. I think, generally speaking, we believe we can -- in the early part of it, 2020 period, start to repatriate some of those positions so that it's more efficient for them to take care of their full patient load inside of HCA facilities. And we're working on that as we speak. We're seeing early indications of some of that happening as we expected, but we're obviously in a very busy time in the first quarter for a lot of our facilities. So that creates some challenges, but we'll sort that out over the course of 2020 and hopefully be in the position that we anticipated. But we're excited about it, as I mentioned, when you couple the fact that United and Sierra has a very strong position in Las Vegas. Las Vegas is a growing market, and we want to be part of that growth with respect to the largest payer in that market. So we see a lot of long-term benefit here to HCA as we execute our strategy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Sandler.
Sarah James: So the stronger ER trend, even if we take out the full impact, is still up about 100 basis points sequentially. How much of that is related to your investments in expanding the trauma program and share gain? And then as we think about the coronavirus playing out, can you just remind us if there was any impact on the model from SARS or MERS and whether that showed up more in ER or urgent care?
Samuel Hazen: Sure. Thanks, Sarah. So our emergency room visit, Bill alluded to this, were up 6.7% with a modest impact coming from the flu. Our freestanding emergency group platform did grow significantly. It was actually above trend. It grew north of 20%. It represents maybe 12% to 14% of our overall ER traffic. But when I look underneath the ER business, we continue to grow our EMS volume. From ground ambulance, it was up 7%, which is consistent with where we've been. Our trauma programs produced 20% volume growth, which is about consistent where we were for the year. We continue to add comprehensive stroke capabilities to our portfolio of offerings that is yielding more traffic for us in our emergency room. But what's important, I think, along the lines of program development, is patient satisfaction. We have seen our operational processing improve throughout the year. We see roughly 9 million-plus emergency room visits a year. On average, we see a patient with a clinician within 11 minutes. Our time to discharge has dropped in 2019 as compared to 2018, and that's yielding both capacity, number one. But more importantly, it's yielding better patient satisfaction. And we think the combination of all of that is driving better performance, better growth and allowing us to use the investments that we put forth in this particular service category more effectively.
William Rutherford: What about SARS in emergency room?
Samuel Hazen: SARS?
William Rutherford: Yes. Impact on emergency room.
Samuel Hazen: Jon Perlin, our Chief Medical Officer.
Jonathan Perlin: Good morning. Historically, SARS or MERS, which are members of the coronavirus family but far more toxic than the current novel coronavirus, did not affect our emergency department volumes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan.
Gary Taylor: Two-part question. The first was I don't think we got the same-store all-payer CMIs this quarter and last. Was wondering if we could get those. And the second part was we've heard some from some hospitals about a cardinal recall of some sterile gowns and surgical kits and causing a little bit of disruption in the ORs in January. Wondering if you're seeing that. And if so, do you think you can just backfill whatever that disruption is in the next few weeks or months, such that the quarterly impact is probably immaterial?
Samuel Hazen: All right. I'll let Jon take that last one, and then we'll circle back on CMI.
Jonathan Perlin: Dr. Jon Perlin here. No. We're fortunate that there are other vendors of the surgical slides you've referenced. Entire supply chain has a pipeline on those have not disrupted our operations.
Samuel Hazen: Yes. Gary, on case mix. I think, as we alluded throughout a couple of comments during the call, we did see a lower trend on our case mix growth in the quarter, principally due to that growth of medical admission outpatient and the surgical admission growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Congrats on a good quarter. Sam, I guess just my question would be on total joint replacement or total knees with CMS approving reimbursement at the beginning of the year. How do you think that changes your strategy on joint replacement? And should we be expecting some volume shifting from inpatient to outpatient over the next few quarters or few years?
Samuel Hazen: Let me start with this. Number one, in the quarter, I think total joints for HCA went up 7%. That's pretty consistent with where they were in the first 3 quarters of the year. Roughly 15% of our total joints are done on an outpatient basis, some in our hospitals, some in our ambulatory surgery centers. Obviously, with the new reimbursement protocols, we anticipate a few more transitioning to that setting. Our goal is to have a comprehensive orthopedic service line. So that means we're trying to align with the physicians in a way that create the environment that they want, the environment they need for their patients, the most efficient environment for the payers. And so we are always dealing with migration patterns as technology advances, and that's part of our run rate. We don't anticipate anything happening in 2020 that's going to materially change our trend as a result of one service category having a bit of migration from one setting to the other. We talk a lot about the diversified portfolio of markets. I think it's equally important to talk about the diversified portfolio of services in HCA. Orthopedics is a very important service line, but it's one of many. It represents less than 10% of our overall revenue. And so if there's a bit of migration and pattern changes inside of that, it doesn't really offset the larger revenue picture for the company. But we're excited about some of the technology that's advanced in orthopedics. We're excited about the research opportunities that we have with our physicians, and we're excited about further alignment of physician groups across the company as it relates to what we're trying to do with orthopedics as a whole. We've had success similarly in cardiovascular care, where we've been able to use service line capabilities and very specialized talent to support different initiatives. We're doing the same in orthopedics, and we think it's going to yield value for the company in the future as we continue to align with high-quality groups.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Costa: Looking at your acquisitions, I think you said about 1% of your EBITDA growth is coming from the acquisitions. Is that all of the acquisitions: Asheville, Houston, Savannah and New Hampshire? Were any of those not -- no longer improving faster than your core operations? And then if I'm doing the math right, your core operations look like they're improving sort of 6% to 8%. If we take the 7% to 9% and then back off the 1% for the acquisitions, it seems like your EBITDA growth from your core operations is growing at a faster rate than your long-term guidance. And I just want to make sure you want to stay with your same long-term guidance of 4% to 6%.
William Rutherford: All right. Yes, Peter, this is Bill. Let me start. Yes. The acquisitions for 2020 will be about 1%, a little bit north. And that is for our '17, '18 and '19 acquisitions going forward on there. As we look at the numbers, we see the core hovering around that 6% and then the acquisitions being that additional 1% to drive us in that -- a little bit north of our longer-term range. And again, I think that is consistent with the discussion we had at the end of the third quarter. And it does not yet include any projection for acquisitions that have yet to be completed. And at this point, we don't see change in kind of that long-term guidance going forward.
Samuel Hazen: I think it's important, this is Sam, to understand that we don't stop pushing on any opportunity. If we have an opportunity in the marketplace today, I mean, we're going to push through it as aggressively as we possibly can. So I think that's part of the operating culture of this company is to optimize the situation, whatever it may be. And I mean we understand the challenge that's out there with our guidance, and we're working through a period of time where we've had a better growth than maybe we've indicated. But I don't think that necessarily puts us in a position yet to change the long-term guidance. As we get through 2020, if we continue to see patterns that are favorable, we will make sure we inform you all appropriately on our thinking around those patterns.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Gillmor of Baird.
Matthew Gillmor: I wanted to ask about commercial volumes more specifically. Obviously, a very strong quarter, I think one of the strongest quarters we can recall. I was curious if there was any service line or geography you'd call out for the quarter? And then how are you thinking about the commercial volume trend into 2020?
Samuel Hazen: This is Sam. I think what we said is we feel like, number one, our portfolio of markets have a lot of positive macro factors that are delivering job growth, more people in commercially insured products. And that's -- we're seeing that in demand. In the second quarter of 2019, which is the latest quarter we have for market share data, the commercial demand across HCA's markets grew by about 1.3%. We think we're picking up market share on commercial business as a result of our network -- investments in program strategies and physician strategies and such. And that's part of the success. We are obviously excited, as I mentioned, about the Las Vegas scenario, and we have other efforts underway to align with payers. So the commercial side, for us, as we look forward, we anticipate demand in that area of maybe 1% to 1.25%; overall demand on the inpatient side, maybe 1.5% to 2%, as we've mentioned in the past. And we believe, again, the programs, the investments, the outreach efforts that we have underway should yield market share gains, but we just need to continue to execute on those basic elements.
Operator: Our final question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets.
Matthew Borsch: All right. I'll try to keep it brief. I just was going to ask that -- as we look ahead, the challenge there that we might face at some point, obviously, via turn in the economy. My question is, as you look back at how you've responded to past recessions, what has sort of been the takeaway in terms of your own lessons learned? Did you responded too quickly, not quickly enough? I'm sure you have a play enough on the shelf somewhere. I'm just -- I guess I'm just asking if that's something that is in your thinking right now and something that you're planning for.
Samuel Hazen: Great. Thank you, Matt. This is Sam. Let me start, and Bill can color in some things here. I think, number one, HCA has proven over time an ability as a large company to make adjustments timely. So I'm really proud of what our teams do in responding to their routine business dynamics. Obviously, if there's a macro factor where the economy starts to contract a little bit, that has implications. Historically, what we've seen is we tend to lag the economy, in general. The health care industry tends to lag. What's different about the economy -- the health care economy today versus previous recessions is the exchange and the ability for individuals who could possibly lose a job going to COBRA for a period of time and then be uninsured. Today, there's potentially a safety net in many markets where the exchanges and the subsidies connected to that or Medicaid in expanded states, and the support from the Medicaid program provide a bit of a safety net. We haven't determined exactly how to process that yet, and that could create a different resiliency, if you will, with respect to our ability to navigate a recession. But as a general rule, our teams are constantly evaluating their trends, competitors and so forth and making adjustments, but we do have that one big factor out there. That's a new dynamic that we are evaluating and trying to understand, but we don't have any experience with it.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Mark Kimbrough: Great. Thank you. I want to thank everybody for joining us today on the call and on the webcast. I'm around in the office. Feel free to give me a call or e-mail me if you have additional questions. Thank you so much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: [Call Starts Abruptly]
Mark Kimbrough: This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. I will now turn the call over to Sam Hazen.
Sam Hazen: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Earlier today, we reported very solid results for the third quarter. The third quarter results were generally comparable to our performance in the first six months of the year, the results were driven by strong revenue growth and good expense management. Revenue increased more than $1.2 billion or 11% in the quarter, this increase was driven by combination of the strongest same facilities growth in volume, we have seen in over the past 17 quarters and the revenue from our recent acquisitions. On a same facilities basis, revenue grew by approximately $700 million or 6.3%. We had broad based volume growth across most service categories and it was balanced across our markets with growth in 13 or 14 domestic divisions. On a same facilities basis, in patient admissions grew 3.2%, we have now grown our same facilities in patient admissions in 22 consecutive quarters. Equivalent admissions grew 4.2%, emergency room visits grew by 4.1%, in patient surgeries grew 2.2% and outpatient surgeries grew by 2.6%. The growth in revenue converted into solid earnings in the quarter with diluted earnings per share of $2.23 which excludes gains on sales of facilities and the losses on retirement of debt. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9% to approximately $2.3 billion, the strategic investments we are making in our business to expand our networks and improve our clinical capabilities are creating greater accessibility for patients to receive high quality convenient patient care in an HCA Healthcare facility. The most recently available in patient market share data again showed good growth for the company. We grew by 55 basis points to an all time high of 25.4%. Finally, I want to thank our employees and physicians for their great work in delivering high quality care to our patients together with our employees and physicians, we use the unique capabilities and scale of HCA Healthcare to make a difference in the communities serve by giving people a healthier tomorrow. With that, let me turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Rutherford: Thank you, Sam, and good morning everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the third quarter results. As Sam mentioned, virtually all of our operating statistics for the quarter were solid and I will provide some additional information. During the third quarter, same facility Medicare admissions increased 3.1% and equivalent admissions increased 4.5%. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Same-facility medicate admissions increased 4.5% and equivalent admissions increased 4.6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Our same-facility managed care admission increased 3.4% and equivalent admissions increased 3.6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 2.1% and equivalent admissions increased 3.5% for the third quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 4.1% in the quarter, our level 1 to 3 visits increased 2%, while our higher acuity level 4 and 5 visits increased 5.8% over the prior year. In addition, admissions to the emergency room increased 3.4% over the prior year. Same-facility net revenue per equivalent admission for a domestic operation grew 2.2% over the prior year in the quarter and year-to-date is growing 2.7% in line with our guidance range for the year. Same-facility in patient surgeries grew 2.2% and our outpatient surgeries grew 2.6% in the quarter over the prior year. Now, let me move on to operating expenses. We had another solid quarter of expense management. Our same-store margins increased 40 basis points in the quarter and our same-facility operating expenses per equivalent admissions grew 1.5% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Our same-facility labor cost per adjusted admission grew 1.9% in the quarter, same-facility average hourly rate grew 2.7 in the quarter versus the prior year and we continue to see labor productivity improvements. Same-facility supply cost per equivalent admission grew 0.9% over the prior year period. Same-facility other operating expenses per adjusted admission increased 0.7% compared to the prior year. During the third quarter, the company recognized a favorable professional liability reserve adjustment of 50 million based on our updated actuarial assessment. This compares to the 70 million favorable adjustment recognized in last year's third quarter. Also, during the quarter, the company recorded an additional 30 million share based compensation expense. Our recent acquisitions also had another solid quarter outperforming our expectations. The acquisitions had an approximately 80 basis points unfavorable impact on consolidated margins in the quarter. So, let me take a moment to talk about cash flow. Cash flow from operations continues to be strong. Cash flow from operations totaled 2.13 billion versus 1.72 billion in the third quarter of last year. Capital spending for the quarter was 1.14 billion in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we redeemed 4.95 billion aggregate principle amount of senior secured notes. Pre-tax losses on retirement of debt totaling 211 million for these redemptions were recorded during the quarter. During the quarter, we paid 239 million to repurchase 1.846 million shares and we have 1.5 billion of repurchase authorization remaining as of September 30, 2019. Also, as mentioned in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had 2.7 billion available on our revolving credit facilities and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.56x. Earnings per shares including gains on sales of facilities on losses on retirement of debt was $2.23 in the third quarter of this year versus $2.16 in the third quarter of last year. The adjustment to the professional liability reserve accounted for $0.11 of EPS this year versus $0.15 last year. Share based compensation expense equated to $0.23 this year and $0.15 last year. And we also recorded $0.08 of EPS in 2018 due to some hurricane tax credits. And finally, the excess tax benefit per share based compensation was $0.01 this year versus $0.07 last year. As noted in our release, we updated our full year 2019 guidance with projected adjusted EBITDA to range between 9.65 billion and 9.85 billion. And projected earnings per share ranged between $10.30 to $10.65 and we anticipate capital spending to approximate 3.8 billion. So, that concludes my remarks and let me turn the call back over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Before we go to questions, I want to give you some preliminary thoughts around 2020. It's always difficult to predict with certainty, the various components of our business. We believe the overall fundamentals in our markets and primary drivers of growth remain strong. We also believe, we are well positioned to capitalize on this favorable environment as we continue to execute our operational initiatives, improve the competitive positioning of our networks with capital spending and integrate our acquired hospitals. As a result, in 2020, subject to our usual assumptions, we believe core operation should grow organically near the mid to upper part of our long-term growth expectations and we believe the acquisitions we have completed should push our growth rate slightly above the top of our long-term growth expectations. We will be wrapping up our budgeting process over the next few months and we look forward to sharing our detailed guidance with you in January. Now, let me turn the call over to Mark for questions.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Sam. Anna, you might now give instructions to those who like to ask questions.
Operator: Yes, sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And will now take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. Just I guess want to jump off of Sam's comments there. So, core growth toward the high-end, I want to just verify that the core growth target is roughly 4% to 6%. And I think this year, you are talking about acquisitions contributing to that, I'm pretty sure you guys have been saying that the acquisition have been contributing about 3% to 4% to growth, I'm assuming that would moderate next year. But, can you just comment on the trajectory of how those bigger acquisitions will continue to contribute as we look at the next year to grow because I assume there'll be incremental permission in Savannah for a couple of years.
Sam Hazen: Thanks A.J. Bill?
Bill Rutherford: Hey A.J. This is Bill. Let me take this. Yes. Let me confirm, we said some time our long-term adjusted EBITDA growth range is between 4% to 6%. We think we have a pretty solid track record of performing within that range and at least recently we've been at the mid to high-end of that range. We're also in a period where acquisitions been contributing to our growth profile. As you mentioned, we anticipated 3% to 4% this year. We expect them to continue to the growth of the company. But as you alluded to likely not at the same rate as this year as we had first year permission and continue to turnaround some of the performance for few others. So I think as Sam mentioned, we haven't completed our budget process, but our commentary was trying to give you some direction on where we see operating with our long-term range. We'll provide obviously a lot more detail and specifics on our year-end call. But I think with a solid performance of the company this year we want to provide a little -- some general comments related to early thoughts for 2020.
A.J. Rice: All right.
Sam Hazen: A.J. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Whit Mayo with UBS.
Whit Mayo: Hey thanks. Bill, you've got the final 2020 in patient rates and dish -- Medicare dish set. We've got the pending outpatient rule. Just sort of curious how the improved pricing environment is sort of shaping your views as you comment on growth at the high-end of your long-term guide, any help around just how internally you guys are thinking about Medicare rates next year would be helpful.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. This is Bill. So, we are anticipating variable Medicare rate update again this year pretty comparable to what we're seeing this year likely in a 2.5% to 3% rate update. So, we factor that in not only to our guidance, and will continue to factor into our 2020. But we do see it being a generally favorable environment relative to the combined Medicare pricing force next year.
Whit Mayo: Okay. Thanks.
Sam Hazen: Thanks Whit.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.
Josh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Question around sort of the CapEx and sort of impact that you guys are getting, it feels like we're kind of in years three of this recent acceleration in CapEx obviously this year are going to be running even higher than you have in recent years. And I know you've spoken in the past about sort of that 15% to 16% return on CapEx. So, I'm curious is that one of the drivers of sort of this improved growth rate that we're seeing in recent years and is there a way to kind of line up growth in specific markets where you've really put some serious dollars in terms of projects and how you guys track it. So, just sort of generally around the CapEx and how that's working?
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. I think capital expenditures and our capital spending plan that's geared toward increasing capacity, adding clinical technology for our physicians, and really building out our ambulatory network is clearly a key component of our growth agenda. It's difficult to pinpoint specifically the value of that in the total performance of the company. Clearly, we can look at an individual hospital and score whether or not we achieved our expectations on our capital. But, keep in mind a lot of our capital is for long run purposes. It's not just for a short run. And so some of our projects because of the complexity of building the project, it's really geared toward a much longer run. So it takes us a while to get a full payoff on that. And so, we monitor our performance against our expectations. Generally speaking, we have outperformed our modeled financial returns on most of our projects. We've had a few obviously that we don't accomplish what we had hoped. But, when you sort of aggregate all that we believe it's contributing to the performance of the company and putting the company globally in a much better competitive position. We are running the company today at occupancy levels of approximately 73% on the inpatient and that's in spite of a lot of capital that's hit this year. I think over the course of this year we're adding more beds than we did in the previous year. And I think in 2020, we're anticipating a similar amount coming online as we had in 2019. So, it's hard for me to point to just that. I mean have a robust physician relationship agenda that's adding value as we continue to add physicians to our network. I think our clinical excellence agenda is yielding value as we continue to improve our quality performance. And then ultimately our outpatient network continues to grow. We will be up to roughly 145 ambulatory surgery centers over 100 freestanding emergency rooms almost 150 urgent care centers and roughly 1300 physician clinics that are connected to our 185 hospitals and all of that is connected to I think the overall volume performance of the company. Bill alluded to this. We had the broadest based volume performance as far as positive metrics that I've seen in almost three years. The only two areas that were flat were behavioral health was flat from an admissions standpoint and our outpatient surgery centers were modestly up. Our hospital based outpatient surgeries was very strong and that's what drove our overall outpatient volumes. So, we had really broad based comprehensive volume growth that I think speaks to the overall growth agenda that the company has had for years. And we think is appropriate as we look forward.
Josh Raskin: Perfect. Thanks.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks Josh.
Operator: Our next question will come from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Pito Chickering: Good morning guys. Nice quarter. Just a follow-up actually on that topic of inpatient and outpatient surgeries. Third quarter was quite strong versus sort of the first half of the year, strong and sort of very challenging comps. And so I guess could you talk a bit more about what caused the strength of both inpatient, outpatient which was it expansion [indiscernible], expansion of ORs, hiring docs or what led to that strengthen and gives conviction around that continuing over the next year and a half.
Sam Hazen: Well, Pito. This is Sam. That's obviously a solid question for us given some of the trends. And we indicated that we expected our procedure volume in the third quarter to be a little bit stronger because we did have a slight calendar tailwind. And when you score that tailwind it did contribute some modestly we think to the overall performance. But I think our surgical growth initiative has been one that we've spoken to over the past number of years as we continue to improve our operating room processes as we continue to respond to what our physicians need. And then, as we continue to invest in technology within our surgical suite. Robotics is an example of that adding deeper capabilities in cardiovascular care and so forth is driving surgical performance for the company. Our cardiovascular surgery on the inpatient was very strong almost 7.5% up. Our orthopedic volume in total, our total joints were up 7%. We had strong robotics performance. Our vascular surgery was performance. So, some of this is clearly supply and that we're adding more Ors, but it's also our physician strategy. It's our program strategy. It's our performance improvement strategy, our clinical initiatives. All of this is really sort of the foundation as I mentioned previously for us as we think about our growth prospects. And we detail our surgical performance very carefully. We detail our physicians in the marketplace very carefully, so we understand what their needs are and then we monitor best performances and best practices across the company to share those broadly. And we think that's a very successful formula and one that's yielding success not just in this quarter but over time. And we believe it will continue to pay dividends for the company as we move into the future.
Mark Kimbrough: Right. Thanks Pito.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. I think I'll settle on this one. Could you give us a little update on how you're approaching physician recruiting, physician employment, acquisition of physicians or seems to be sort of a renewed pace of activity private equity, others making acquisitions are rolling up some of the physician space and just wanted to see if your strategy is going to have to change to any degree in terms of outright employment and acquisitions.
Sam Hazen: I don't see a change. This is Sam again. Gary, thank you. I don't see a change in our strategy per se. We have been about recruiting we have been about employment. We have been about other methods of alignment with a clinical relationship and leadership and program development and those continue to yield success for us. We are growing our medical staffs at about 1.5% to 2% per year. It's coming through all of those channels, I just spoke to. We believe that across the company's portfolio of facilities that are physician development initiatives are gaining momentum in the face of some of these issues that you alluded to. And it's because folks are seeing the investments that we're making, the improvements in overall quality and nursing that we're making. And it's attracting physicians. We have 45,000 physicians who practice at HCA facilities. We employ about 7,000 of those. We are growing our employment ranks at probably 8% to 12% per year. So, it is a more common tactic within our physician ranks, but it's not a sole strategy for us as we look to the future.
Gary Taylor: Thank you.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks Gary.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the commentary on 2020 guys. A question here on the balance sheet. Came out of the -- it looks like you're going to come out of the year, I should say with debt to EBITDA at low end of your range at about 3.5%. If I kind of just do some math on the implied guide, you'd be at more like 3.25%. So yes, I know your long-term target is 3.5% to 4.5%. It looks like you'd have $7 billion, $8 billion of room just to get back to the mid point. So, just curious as to how you're thinking about that opportunity kind of going into 2020, would think the M&A pipeline share repurchase opportunity, et cetera. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Justin, thanks for the question. This is Bill. You're right, our leverage ratios at the low end of our range and we are obviously very pleased with that. We think this continues to give the company a lot of flexibility and optionality into the future. As far as the longer term range. Obviously, some will give a lot of thought to and we'll continue to evaluate it. Not making any changes to our range at this time, but as you know, we're going into our planning cycle. We continue to evaluate our capital policies. We do have a couple of smaller acquisitions that hopefully we'll close towards the end of the year. We'll likely fund through that. We've stated for some time we think the strength of our cash flow and physician, the balance sheet is obviously an important attribute for the company. We think we've got a pretty balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation from our capital investments to share repurchase to dividends as well as managing the balance sheet. So, again, I think we're very pleased with the result. I think the level where we are right now continues to give us a lot of flexibility as we continue to see potentially high value acquisitions come into the fold. We've got the capability to execute on those.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks Justin.
Justin Lake: Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I just want to follow up. I guess Q2 was a little bit surprising to people and it seemed like it was -- I guess you guys called it a revenue issue and I guess in particular kind of commercial volumes being weak. This quarter looks better, but I wonder if you could maybe say it's still kind of towards the lower end of your long-term view on pricing. So, just want to see where we are on that and if there's any post-mortem on what happened in Q2 and why it seems to be getting better now.
Sam Hazen: Bill.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Kevin, thanks. This is Bill. So yes, Q2 was a little soft. We attributed some case mix, some isolated issues and a few markets. We were pleased to see it bounce back up. Obviously, we had very good payer mix with the commercial volume growth. Year-to-date as we mentioned, we're at that 2.7, 2.5 range if you will, which is right in the midpoint of our range. So again, I think with our visibility and our contracts, we will continue to have great visibility into our commercial contracts. We continue, as Sam mentioned, invest in some of our higher acuity services that I think second quarter just post some softness for us and pleased with where we are in a year-to-date. And rebounded here in the third quarter as well.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: We will take our next question from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.
Ann Hynes: Hi, good morning. I know you gave some color on the acquisitions, but I love some more color just on the margin profile. Late 2017, early 2018 you acquired 2 billion of revenue. Can you let us know what the merger and profile of those acquisitions are right now and mission as well? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: As a portfolio if you will, I'd say the margin of those acquisitions are running high single digit right now. And that's where we anticipated, we knew each of them have a little bit different story to them. We knew Memorial and Savannah would take us some time to recover, very pleased with the performance of where that stands. Mission, obviously, we're in the first year. So, I think I characterize the margin performance of those acquisitions is high single digit. The contributing to the growth this year as we've mentioned, we think they'll continue to contribute to growth next year and we knew those would be multi-year process for us. So that's how I would characterize the margins, high single digits right now.
Ann Hynes: Thanks.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks Ann.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs.
Steve Tanal: Thanks guys. Good morning. I guess one quick question. Hey, Mark. Just the managed care adjusted admissions growth was really strong and compare a year ago looked particularly tough. So kind of just thinking through that, I kind of wanted to get your thoughts on the macro environment. Obviously, Medicaid adjusted admins are still growing a bit faster than commercial, but commercial's really solid and absolutes. And so how are you all thinking about payer mix? Are these dynamics pretty good? I mean, is that a headwind in your mind or any commentary there. And if you have the acuity mix number that would be great to the index. Thanks guys.
Sam Hazen: Well, I think the environment we still read is very positive. We continue to see solid economic indicators in our markets. Good employment numbers. We had anticipated commercial growth in that 1% to 2% range. We're running on a year-to-date basis. So, I think would characterize the overall market is still is favorable for us. We know in any one period they are subject to some trends here or there, very pleased with the commercial volume trends in the second quarter. But overall, when we look at the economic indicators, we look at the employment indicators, we're looking at our access to contracts. We still think that's a pretty good environment for the HCA. Relative to intensity, our case mix was basically flat for the quarter. We think there are some factors that are contributing to that. We continue to see that our clinical improvement initiatives are paying dividends as we see reducing sepsis, reducing ventilator days for critical care patients, improving end of life. All of these clinical initiatives do have some impact on our case mix metrics, but obviously brings a lot of value to our patients. So, we think there's some -- probably a few other service line areas, but again, I think the revenue clearance that we had in the quarter was very strong and in line with our expectations.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks Steve.
Operator: We will now take a question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan: Good morning. You referenced a couple of smaller acquisitions that you may wrap up before the end of the year in terms of capital deployment. I think I've seen some press accounts on some of those, but I'm more curious about the opportunity for larger systems like you did with Mission and with then Savannah. I'm just curious, are you seeing any change in the landscape there that might suggest some of those kinds of opportunities maybe more likely. Thanks.
Sam Hazen: I don't know that the landscape per se Frank, this is Sam. It's changing. I think we are having more discussions. I'll say with systems, whether or not any of those discussions materialize into a transaction that works for the seller or works for us is yet to be determined. We as Bill indicated, have a balance sheet that we think is positioned to absorb some decent size acquisitions. We think our organizational capability and chassis if you will, is built to take on more. And so we're looking, we're talking, but we don't know if anything will necessarily surface as we go through the next few years. Obviously, the marketplace is generally good for most of the not-for-profits that are out there. And it will be a forward thinking board that makes a decision in my estimation to want to do a strategic decision or transaction with us and looks beyond sort of the short run. So, what we have to see how those discussions go? We're excited about the acquisitions that we've done. As Bill indicated, we're seeing a progression in performance. We're accomplishing what we had anticipated internally with our modeling for the most part. And we still see opportunities for improvement in them. So, that gives us confidence that our capability in assimilating acquisitions in the organization are getting better. And so as opportunities present themselves we're hopeful that we'll be able to take advantage of those.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, Frank.
Frank Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Steven Valiquette: Sorry. Thanks. Good morning. So, certainly lots of strong operating trends this quarter. And this was touched on a little bit, but obviously the same-store revenue per adjusted admission improved slightly from last quarter. But didn't have quite the snapback in 3Q to the 3.5% to 4.5% trends that the company posted for about six quarters in a row before that metric softened up a little bit with the 2Q results. So I guess, I'm just curious if there's any -- just additional color around potential improvements in the variables that are hidden there, I mean, you obviously touched on the commercial surgeries, but curious if there is anything else kind of hitting that a little bit. And do you see a glide path to that getting back to 4% near term just based on how things are progressing right now. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Thanks. This is Bill. So, we've said we anticipate 2% to 3% in RAA. We've said our year-to-date performance is right in the middle of that. We are confident that we saw the improvement from the second quarter to third quarter. We look at our inpatient revenue per admission grew 4.2%, so really solid inpatient growth. And that coupled with our outpatient revenue growth. I'll tell you, we really don't see any structural or major factors that influence that, or with the complexity of our revenue, there are a lot of variables that impact that between mix and service acuity and so forth. But, I think I characterize, we're pleased with where we are on a year-to-date performance. And again, I don't see any really major changes -- structural changes that should impact materially.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. All right. Appreciate the extra color. Thanks.
Operator: We will now take a question from Scott Fidel with Stephens.
Scott Fidel: Thanks. Question just -- one of your peers that had reported that talked about being a bit more aggressive posture from some of the payers in 3Q in terms of denials on inpatient admits versus observation. Just wanting to see it doesn't look like it from some of the fundamentals that you recorded on commercial volumes and pricing, but they just want to see whether, have you seen any of that similar dynamic in any of your markets and recently or has that not been the case?
Bill Rutherford: This is bill. So, those are always factors that we deal with in the administration of health. We called out observation in the past and we see that kind of cycle around the country in terms of utilizing observation in patient status. Denials is a challenge for the industry that we spend a considerable amount of time and effort appealing and making the clinical case. And we have seen that activity increase. I don't characterize it as that a material driver for us. We've got strong operating indicators that we can overcome that. But, I think the industry continues to deal with patient status and observation as well as denials and the adjudication of claims that we spent a considerable amount of time, effort and resources and we think HCA is well positioned to advance our case when we do have those denials. But, it's a factor for us that we have to deal with.
Sam Hazen: Let me add to that Bill. I think we have efforts underway with a number of the major payers to take advantage of our technology, their technology, our size, their size to create a more friction free environment for our patients and not have sort of the confusion that that centers around some of the billing processes both for them and their members and for us and our patients. And I'm optimistic that some of these major payers are going to move toward a more technology friendly capability for both organizations that yield a better answer for the patient and the member. And so that's part of what we're attempting to do with our Parallon capabilities and integrate that appropriately into some of the claims shops that these big payers have. So that it's a much more efficient, low cost transaction environment for both organizations.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: We will now move to Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.
Matt Borsch: Let me yet stick on theme that Scott was asking about, but a different -- slightly different area that which is, we've heard that one of the largest payers is instituting a rule where all hospital cited outpatient procedures are going to have to go through pre-certification of some sort. I'm curious if you're -- if that's something on your radar screen and whether you think that will have impact in the fourth quarter.
Sam Hazen: Well, this is Sam. I don't anticipate any fourth quarter impact from that particular policy that you're referencing. We have provisions inside of most of our contracts that speak to how the network will function, the network being our inpatient facilities or outpatient hospital facilities and our ambulatory facilities. And so typically speaking, we protect that network in a way that is appropriate for the payer and the patient and our physicians. And ultimately we have dealt with a lot of these policies and procedures in the past around site selection and so forth. And we'll continue to work with the payers on those to find the right location for the patient, so they get the clinical outcome they want. It's at the price point that's appropriate and we're not anticipating any significant change in sort of the composition of our business as a result of that.
Matt Borsch: Thank you.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: We'll now move to Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein.
Lance Wilkes: Yes. I was wondering for the quarter, can you talk a little bit about the share taking end market and how much of that is payer strategies, maybe changes in steerage networks and things like that as opposed to maybe physician directed with your owned or affiliated physicians and other sorts of strategies?
Sam Hazen: I think if you go back to the comments -- this is Sam that I made about our growth model and how we think about our growth model. That model has been consistent for us over the years and we find that it resonates in the marketplace with the patient. It resonates with the physician and it resonates with the payer. And so the combination of those components of our model we think is yielding the market share gains that we have sustained over time. In our most recent information we gained market share in 22 or 25 service lines that we monitor and we gained share in 73% of our markets where we get information. So, the basic elements of our growth model, appropriately detailed, appropriately resourced and really well executed by our employees and our teams is yielding what we believe to be the value inside of this growth model. Again, it's value for our patients, we believe; it's value for our physicians; and ultimately we think it's value for the payers. And so our approach, it's hard to sort of deconstruct one item to say that this item is what's driving it, because it varies a little bit from one market to the other depending on the circumstances. But when we pull up an aggregate, the performance of the company aggregate the strategy of the company and start to point to it, we think it takes all components of sort of the HCA flywheel, if you will, to ultimately drive this kind of consistent growth that we've been able to sustain for extended periods of time.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Lance.
Operator: We'll now take a question from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.
Sarah James: Thank you. Volumes were pretty strong across the board and the quarter. Did that put any pressure on using temporary staff? Where do you guys sit now on temp staff usage and how impactful is that on your expense load? Then more broadly on expense control, last quarter you mentioned ongoing efforts for supply chain and I T savings revenue cycle management. How are you thinking about how much further you can push these initiatives? How much savings is left to be achieved? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Thanks Sarah. Yes, Sarah. This is Bill. So, we continue to be pleased with the operating cost performance of the company. Obviously, when we get good volume we can leverage some of our fixed cost structure and pleased with the performance. We have, as you probably know, initiatives throughout all aspects of the company from continuing to manage labor costs to supply cost improvements to other operating and I think that yielded and showed itself in the third quarter. So, we're very pleased with the performance, very proud of our teams in terms of what they do to manage the cost structure of the company. Regarding temporary labor, that was an area we call it out that we saw some really good improvement over the past, call it, year to year and a half as our operators reduced our turnover and we reduced our contract labor. Tell you that's pretty stabilized on us right now year-to-date. Pleased, when we do have volume peaks, we sometimes have to use that temporary labor, but we manage it within the whole context of the labor line. So again, I think for the quarter we're pleased with where we stand and year-to-date we continue to manage that 2% to 3% range. That's a solid number for us.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks Sarah.
Sarah James: Thank you.
Operator: We'll now move to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Costa: Good morning, nice quarter. Looks like in Washington a lot of the healthcare issues are being sort of kicked into early next year. Things like surprise billing and dish. Are these delays going to hurt you guys in any way or do you think it gives you just more time to repair? And is there any one of those that we should focus on more than some of the others in terms of something that could have more of an impact given the delays?
Sam Hazen: Well, I think this is Sam again. I think, obviously, there are a lot of discussions going on in Washington about healthcare within the democratic primary and then within the legislative process currently within the Washington DC area. And even in some states we're seeing some healthcare policy discussions that we're having to engage in. Obviously, we said this before, we are supportive of legislation that protects the patient, whether that's protecting the patient from a surprise bill as defined or a in making sure that the patient has the transparency around their out of pocket costs. So, we're supportive of those elements. I think moving beyond those elements, we do have concerns and we don't believe that they're going to accomplish more than what they need to accomplish around the patient. So those two pieces of legislation, the surprise billing and the transparency, again, as it relates to the patient being protected and getting the necessary information, we're supportive neither of those present any unusual challenges for us. As we think about the future it's just that we think if they overreach, if you will in some of those areas, it could create some challenges here or there. As it relates to the dish, I think we're still waiting for the final outcome on that, but we don't anticipate that having a very significant impact on our Medicare revenues as we move into the 2020.
Peter Costa: Thanks.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks Pete. Diana, we are going to take three more and then, we are going to close it off.
Operator: Okay. Perfect. Thank you, sir. We'll now take a question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just really quick and simple question for me. So, as I think about the qualitative comments you made about what the 2020 outlook, how should we be thinking about your views on margin expansion? I'm factoring in obviously the improvement in the acquired hospitals from 2017. And then what percentage or is there M&A baked into that expectation as well, incremental over what's already been announced? Thanks.
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. Obviously, if we grow our volumes and we can keep our revenue on the high side of our guidance, we said this before towards the 5% to 6% on revenue growth, which is what we've generally had over the past six or seven quarters. We believe we should be able to increase our same stores operating margin with that kind of revenue growth, whether it comes in volume or in unit price combination. We think that's high enough to where we should be able to grow our operating margin all things being equal. As it relates to the low end of the range, our belief is that we should be able to maintain margins thereabouts with respect to our same stores portfolio. As Bill spoke to a minute ago, our models for all of our acquisitions have a steady improvement in margins over time. These are large institutions. They have a lot of people connected to them and we have to be appropriate in how we adjust them to a more efficient environment. And as we make those adjustments, we do anticipate margin improvements as to how that affects the company's overall performance. I don't think it will color the margins of the company as much as the same store's performance, but our belief is that if we can grow our revenue in the upper side of our range, we should be able to incrementally generate a margin improvement. I think in this quarter, our revenue clearance to EBITDA was roughly a 1.5x our average margin. And that's a good metric for us. And so that's at 6.3% same stores revenue growth, we were able to clear that revenue at about a 1.5x our average margin heading into the quarter. So that's a pretty good sort of microcosm of how we think about it. There are puts and takes to that and they have to be considered from one quarter to the next, but over time that would be our approach and our thinking.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: We'll now move to Matthew Gilmore with Baird.
Matthew Gilmore: Hey, thanks for the question. The self pay volume growth seemed pretty moderate this quarter even with a stronger ER visit number, I mean you could get some color on what drove that lower growth and self-pay was that just normal fluctuation quarter-to-quarter or anything new to call out that's helping to moderate that?
Sam Hazen: Well, we've been pleased with that performance, say the one thing I would call out is Virginia expanded Medicaid this year. So that's impacting some of that as we see conversions from self pay into Medicaid. So that's having a positive impact on that self-pay trend. Even if we normalize for that, I tell you it's still within what our expectations are within this, mid to higher single digit growth even outside the Virginia Medicaid expansion.
Matthew Gilmore: Got it. Thanks very much.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Take care.
Operator: Yes, sir. That will be from John Ransom with Raymond James.
John Ransom: Hey, good morning. Pretty wide range in your 4Q guide. Do you think we'll continue to see more seasonality for elective procedures into 4Q and if so, how did you factor that into your implied guidance?
Bill Rutherford: Yes, John. This is Bill. As I look at our guidance, our full year numbers pretty much in line with what we're running generally close to that 9% on a consolidated basis. Once you adjust for a few things, do remind everyone in fourth quarter of last year was a really strong quarter for us as well. As terms of seasonality, there always tends to be a little bit, I'll tell you right now, that hasn't been a major factor in our thinking. We've seen that level out over the past several years. So, we've just continued to look at the progression of the quarters throughout the year and our fourth quarter guidance is with that. Obviously, we've been changing and improving our guidance each quarter as we've gone through the year where we stand right now, it looks to be pretty much consistent with what our year-to-date performances. So, that's where we stand for a 2019.
John Ransom: And just kind of as a follow-up to that, I know Mark's just want to cut me off, but this is a really interesting question. The Mercer survey showed another 300 bps of high copay plan growth for fiscal '20. How are you guys thinking about, if at all your patient engagement and financing strategies just with this continued relentless growth in patient out of pocket?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. John, I think we handle that reasonably well. I'll tell you from our view, we haven't seen a change that dramatically from what we've seen over the past several years. We're very pleased with our revenue cycle and our Parallon teams to address that. But, fro our view, I don't know if I see it accelerating as much as some of those headlines. So it's just within the context of our total revenue clearance that we managed through.
Sam Hazen: And one thing, this is Sam, that Bill and his team have done is I think create industry leading patient protection policies to help the patient deal with some of the burdens that come with high deductible plans. And in many instances, the patients don't fully understand what they've signed up for. And then they hit the system and we have to work with them to understand -- explain to them their plans and so forth. But we've built I think, a very patient friendly protection policy that's probably one of the most comprehensive ones in the industry to ensure that our engagement and our understanding with our patients is fair to them in a way that helps them get through some of the challenges that exist with these policies.
John Ransom: Great. Thanks so much.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, John.
Operator: That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the presentation back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. I want to thank everyone for joining us today on the call. As always, I'm available if you have additional questions or clarifications that you would need, just feel free to give me a call. But anyway, thanks again.
Operator: And once again, that does conclude today's conference and we thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the HCA second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Kimbrough: Well, thank you for the promotion, Ian. I appreciate that very much. Good morning and welcome to everyone on today's call and our webcast. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen and Bill Rutherford, our CFO, which will provide comments on the company's results for the second quarter. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statement, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligations to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in today's second quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay of the call will be available later today. I will now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. Earlier today, we reported our second quarter results. The results were driven by positive trends in the following areas, solid volume growth, cost metrics that were mostly in line with our expectations and good performance from our acquisitions. These positive results were offset by slower growth in revenue per equivalent admissions which resulted in reported revenue and adjusted EBITDA that were slightly below are our internal expectations. Adjusted EBITDA grew by approximately 3% to $2.3 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin at 18.2%. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $2.25, which was down 2.6% from last year. We have carefully reviewed what drove this lower revenue growth and importantly we don't believe it represents a headwind with respect to achieving our four years earnings guidance. Bill will provide the details in his comments. Revenue grew by almost $1.1 billion, a 9.3% increase. This increase was driven by volume growth broadly across our markets, service lines and by revenue generated from our recent acquisitions. On a same facilities basis, revenue grew by 4.3%. Inpatient admissions and equivalent admissions grew 2.1% and 2.6%, respectively. Emergency room visits grew 3% and total surgeries were up modestly. We have now grown same facilities inpatient admissions in 21 consecutive quarters. Inpatient market share trends remained positive for the company. Based upon an analysis of our results and year-to-date performance, we are confident in the second half of the year. We have not seen any major structural changes within our markets from a competitive standpoint, physician standpoint, payor standpoint or execution standpoint. The fundamentals in our markets remain strong with growing demand for healthcare services. We continue to believe we are well-positioned for growth as we execute our operational initiatives, improve the overall competitive positioning of our local healthcare systems and integrate our acquired hospitals. The strategic investments we are making to expand the inpatient and outpatient capacity within our networks and improve our clinical capabilities create more opportunity for patients to access high-quality convenient care in an HCA Healthcare facility. With that, let me turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Rutherford: Okay. Thank you Sam and good morning everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the second quarter results. Then we will open the call for questions. As Sam mentioned, our volume stats were solid and I will provide some additional information. During the second quarter same facility Medicare admissions increased 2.5% and equivalent admissions increased 3.2%. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 3.2% and equivalent admissions increased 2.3% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Our same facility commercial admissions were flat while equivalent admissions increased 1.9% in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 5.1% in the second quarter compared to the prior year and was in line with our expectations. When looking at our 3% growth in emergency room visits in the quarter, our level one through three visits increased 0.6%, while our higher acuity level four and five visits increased 4.9% over the prior year. In addition, admissions through the emergency room increased 3% over the prior year. Same facility net revenue per equivalent admissions grew 1.7% over the prior year in the quarter. This growth rate was lower than our recent results, which has averaged 1.5% to 2% higher. So let me give you a little more information on factors that affected this in the quarter. And there were two primary drivers I would like to call out. Our commercial revenue growth was softer in the quarter, primarily because admissions were flat and there was a moderation of our acuity growth in the quarter, which was primarily driven by decline in inpatient surgeries. The second item is that we had some favorable revenue items last year across some state's supplemental and graduate medical education programs that did not reoccur this year. Our total adjusted EBITDA impact from these supplemental programs was approximately $65 million, which was primarily attributable to revenue. We do not believe the supplemental programs will be a headwind for the remainder of the year. Our year-to-date revenue performance is in line with our full year expectations. Year-to-date same facility net revenue per equivalent admission has increased 3%, which is within our guidance range of 2% to 3% for 2019. So let me move on operating expenses. Operating expenses per equivalent admission for the second quarter were consistent with recent trends. Our same-store operating cost per adjusted admission grew 3.1% over the prior year in the quarter. While our cost as a percent of revenue did increase in the quarter, we view this as a function of the softer revenue growth I discussed previously. Our recent acquisitions had an approximate 80 basis points unfavorable impact on margins for the quarter. Same facility labor trends were consistent with recent trends in prior year. Man-hours per adjusted patient day and employee per occupied bed, two key productivity indicators, both improved 0.8% compared to the prior year. Same facility average hourly rate grew 2.6% in the quarter versus prior year. Same facility supply cost per equivalent admission grew 2.1% over the prior year period. Same facility other operating expense per adjusted admission roast 3.6%, mainly due to a change in some state's supplemental program expenses, which I mentioned earlier. In summary, while our revenue results were softer than our expectations, our adjusted EBITDA was only about 1.5% below our internal expectations. And overall, we remain pleased with our year-to-date performance. So let me take a moment to talk about cash flow. Cash flow from operations was strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations totaled approximately $2 billion versus $1.58 billion in the second quarter of last year. Capital spending for the second quarter was $964 million, in line with our expectations. During June 2019, we issued $5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes and used the proceeds to temporarily reduce the outstanding balance on our asset-based revolving credit facility. During July 2019, we redeemed $4.95 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes. Pretax losses on retirement of debt totaling $211 million for these redemptions will be recognized during the quarter ending September 30, 2019. During the second quarter, we paid $242 million to repurchase 1.9 million shares and had $1.75 billion remaining on our previous authorization as of June 30, 2019. Also, as mentioned in our release this morning, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $5.7 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.83 times. However, the amount available under our revolving credit facilities would have been $2.47 billion and the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio would event 3.66 times after giving effects to our July 5, 2019 debt redemptions. As noted in our release, we adjusted our full year 2019 guidance with projected adjusted EBITDA to range between $9.6 million and $9.85 billion and projected EPS to range between $10.25 and $10.65. So let me turn the call back over to Sam before we go to Q&A.
Sam Hazen: Thank you Bill. Before we go to Q&A, I want to make four more points. First, our management teams are relentlessly focused on executing our agenda as we have always been. Secondly, we are confident in what we are doing and our outlook for 2019. Third, periodically we have quarterly results that don't reflect our longer run beliefs. The first quarter was that and the second quarter was also that. That's why we believe year-to-date performance is more indicative. And fourth, where appropriate we are making adjustments to our cost structure as we historically have done. So with that, Ian, let's go into questions-and-answers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Pito Chickering: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to drill down a little bit more on the inpatient admissions for your commercial book of business, a couple of questions. Can you sort of talk about different markets, if that weakness was widespread among the markets? You talked about some more competition. Did you see some markets that had increased competition from that? And then also on strategic investments, you guys are continuing to invest in inpatient business. Does the 2Q results change your view of making those investments?
Sam Hazen: All right. Pito, thank you. This is how I would answer that question. We had 12 of 14 domestic divisions that had admission growth. We had 12 of 14 adjusted admissions or divisions that had adjusted admissions growth. On the managed care side, we had eight divisions that were up, two that were flat and four that were down. On surgeries, in total we had nine divisions that were up, one was flat and four was down. So generally speaking, our portfolio performed pretty well. We did have a couple of markets that were softer than we anticipated. We understand what those drivers are. We think we have the appropriate responses in place to deal with them and we will continue to execute on those. To give you a few more statistics on the volume side, which again, the company had a very productive volume quarter. Rehab admissions were up 8%. As Bill said, our emergency room visits were up 3%. Our trauma was up almost 15%. We had tremendous growth again in our cardiac volumes with our PCI volume, our cardiac CAT volume up 2.5%, electrophysiology up 4%, CV surgery up 4.5%. So we had a very broad based, as I mentioned in my comments, service line growth and also division wide growth. The issue is, we were a little bit softer in total for our managed care admissions, as Bill alluded to and that did put some pressure in the quarter on our revenue. I don't think it significantly changes our thinking around investments. As I mentioned, we believe our strategy is appropriate for the market. We continue to invest in it in an appropriate way in my opinion and we think it will produce opportunities for the company to generate growth in the future.
Pito Chickering: Great. And one follow up. If the weak commercial story continues in the back half of the year, what levers do you guys have available on the cost side to react to the softness?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Pito, this is Bill. Let me try to address that. As Sam mentioned, our teams are making adjustments every day. We have great operators and we are obviously proud of the work they do. We manage productivity daily, even hourly matching our labor trends to projected volume. And I mentioned our productivity gains in the comments. We have process improvement teams throughout our operations who work in a variety of cost efficiencies such as throughput in the emergency room and OR, also working with our clinical teams on clinical efficiencies. We benchmark ourselves to our best performers on a wide range of metrics and identify improvement opportunities. We continue to strive for cost efficiencies in our support structures and continuing to leverage size of scale, which we have been doing for some time in revenue cycle, supply chain, information technology support, human resources and the like. And then as Sam mentioned, we will look for fixed costs and overhead reductions, where appropriate and where we believe we have the opportunity. So we continue to believe we have appropriate control systems around managing our cost structure. As we step back, we don't cost management was the issue for the quarter. We continue to make adjustments where we believe is appropriate and will continue to do that in the future.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks Pito.
Pito Chickering: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs.
Steve Tanal: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess I just wanted to focus on the revenue per adjusted admission, the metric there and some the drivers you called out. So forgive me for being specific here but there is a few things I wanted to touch on. The lapping of the $65 million of supplemental payments in the second quarter, was the expectation that that would recur? I just don't remember that as a call out last year and just thinking through that, I think the size of that is maybe 60 bips or so. You framed 150 to 200 basis point delta versus recent trends on the metrics. So is it sort of fair to say that the biggest driver within there was with sort of commercial volumes? And any reason why that slowed? Maybe how widespread it was? Just really trying to understand if that's just a function of sort of low unemployment, more macro driven or if there is anything more specific you could tell us about that. And finally, just an acuity mix read would be helpful. I don't know if I missed that, but those are the three parts to that question.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Thanks Steve. Let me start. So on the supplemental payments on there, we did not expect that to reoccur. We didn't call it out in 2018, because it wasn't really an issue on a year-over-year basis because we had at least two of the three programs we mentioned in 2017 and 2018. As we went through our budget process, we knew those wouldn't reoccur. So they were not in our internal plan as we went forward in 2019. So that's why our internal plan, we weren't that far off on our performance for the level. On the managed care volume, as Sam mentioned, it's a handful of markets. We did see our commercial surgical volume decline in that area. That did flow through on the acuity in a couple of service lines. But as Sam mentioned, we don't think that we see any structural or significant changes across the marketplace. So that influenced both the volume and the flow-through to acuity related to that.
Steve Tanal: Okay.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks Steve.
Steve Tanal: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now take our next question from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice: Hi everybody. I just wanted to, picking up on Sam's comments towards the end there, the little more volatility from quarter-to-quarter. I mean that seems to be something we are seen across the sector. Obviously, one of your peers had the exact opposite, really soft first quarter and a strong second quarter and surgeries were part of that. Do you think there is anything going on, either with benefit design changes, I don't know, terms of your managed care contracts? When people talk about the deductibles and high-deductible plans and that having an impact on traditional seasonality, is there any way you can look at the calendar, I know the calendar is different in the way some of the holidays fell this year versus last year? Or is there anything else that you think is creating a little more volatility from quarter-to-quarter where you still end up the same point for the year, but maybe the seasonal patterns are not what they used to be exactly?
Sam Hazen: A.J., this is Sam. I don't know that we have anything that would suggest the seasonal patterns are changing on us. I mean we went through a period of time, as we have discussed on these calls in the past, where we felt there was some migration to outpatient procedures in the last part of the year because of deductibles and holidays and so forth. So we tend to see some outpatient surgical activity and procedure activity increase in the fourth quarter. But as it relates to the first half of the year, I don't know that we have any indications that seasonality factors are changing on us. I think my point was that, you know, the first quarter was incredibly good for HCA and had tremendous, like mid teens same stores growth, if I remember correctly and we just felt that we had a perfectly good quarter that yielded tremendous bottomline results. And then we looked at the second quarter and it just didn't play out as we had anticipated entirely. Not that far off, as Bill indicated. And so, when we sort of pull up and look at the business and then look at our markets and we just completed our midyear reviews with our divisions, we feel pretty good about where we are on a year-to-date basis and we think that's fairly reflective of our business and how it should play out over the remainder of the year. And so, that's why we sort of called it out that way. But we will continue to study. We will hopefully get a good indicator here in the third quarter and move through the year as we think. But there is nothing to suggest that seasonality has played into this in any material way.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you A.J.
A.J. Rice: I think the managed care companies have pointed to an extra business day in the third quarter is a bit of a headwind for them. Is that something out that -- is that enough to move the needle, in your mind for you guys at all?
Sam Hazen: Well, clearly, with an extra business day, we will have more procedures most likely because of that. So whether or not, over the course of the whole quarter that will have a material impact, we will just have to wait and see. But business days to influence our surgical activity and some of our procedure activity.
A.J. Rice: Okay.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks A.J. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now take our next question. It comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Thank you. You may go ahead.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Sam, I appreciate the comments on the confidence in the second half EBITDA run rate. Given the weaker commercial volumes in acuity in the second quarter, I am curious whether that confidence is a function of management expecting commercial trends to return to previous levels in the second half? Or whether you are driving cost improvements that will allow you hit these numbers even if the commercial trends continue at those second quarter levels?
Sam Hazen: Well, I would say, it's a bit of a blend. It's not one or the other. I don't think the second quarter is necessarily reflective of commercial volumes. We have had, I think, six straight quarters where we have had adjusted admission growth in our commercial activity. I think five straight quarters heading into the second quarter where we had inpatient commercial admission growth. So we don't necessarily see anything changing within the markets, as I have mentioned, that would suggest that the second quarter is the marker for us as we move forward. But when you do bump up our expectations for some rebound there plus some cost initiatives where we think we have some incremental opportunities for improvement, those two combined, I think, Justin give us a reasonable level of confidence as we look to the last half of the year.
Justin Lake: Okay. If I could just squeeze in a quick number - I got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And now we will take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. Can you maybe call out the specific service lines where you saw the pressure that drove the lower acuity? And then I think in the past you have given managed care revenue, I think, per admission. So hoping you can kind of give that for the second quarter? And then the last thing, just anything to call out on bad debt or collection rate that could maybe influence the revenue capture and pricings data in the quarter? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Ralph, let me try to take some of those. When we look at the service lines, it was in some of our spine surgical procedures, orthopedics and some women services. We think on the orthopedic side on the commercial, we could have caught some of that as they moved into the outpatient area. But it's mainly in the spine and women services and the same metric spread among a handful of markets on there. On the collection rates, we are not seeing any material change in our collection rates. Our net days actually had declined on us for the year. So we continue to feel very comfortable with our revenue cycle operations. And the net revenue per admission for our commercial side was running 3.5% on a revenue per admission in the second quarter.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thank you.
Sam Hazen: Thanks Ralph.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Sam Hazen: Hi Brian.
Brian Tanquilut: Hello Sam. Can you hear me?
Sam Hazen: Yes, now we can. Yes.
Brian Tanquilut: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a question on price transparency. Obviously, as CMS came out with a proposal yesterday and how do you think that plays out and where do you think HCA is positioned if that actually goes through in terms of pricing and where you stand in the markets that you operate in? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. This is Bill. I will take a stab at that. Obviously, it's early. We just got that last night. We are still interpreting that. We have been on record that HCA supports price transparency and we believe that's helping our patients gain a reasonable understanding and estimate of the cost prior to service. So we support those efforts. We will have to see an implementation in terms of the specific procedures out there our approach to complying with that and we think HCA will continue to show good value. We don't know exactly where we stand relative to others in the marketplace and we think that will create some opportunities, maybe some challenges there. But we think, again, the HCA system will stand up well on a price transparency view.
Sam Hazen: Yes. Let me just add to that, Bill. I think a couple of things. Over the past five to 10 years, we have been on this journey to try to narrow the band amongst our payors so that there is not a large delta between the lowest payor and the highest payor. And we have a delta but it's not significant and we have narrowed it significantly over time. So that's point number one. Point number two, we think we are competitive in the marketplace. Otherwise, we would not be accomplishing contract renewals at the pace that we are. And for 2020, we are about 80% contracted. And for 2021, we are about 60% contracted at what I would call normal inflationary trends. Therefore, I believe we are generally competitive. To Bill's point, there could be a market here or there where we are under a competitor. We believe that in a handful of cases, there could be a market here or there where maybe we are in a better position from a he pricing standpoint and we will just have to sort that out over time. But at this point, we are focused on the patient and getting the patient the necessary information for them to understand their cost. So we are going to go through this comment period that CMS has offered and make sure we push forward appropriate thoughts and appropriate ideas on dealing with the patient and it will determine whether or not there is an appropriate way to deal with other kind of pricing that is embedded in the proposed rule.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Brian, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Frank Morgan: Good morning. Hate beating this issue, but could you tell just a little bit may be about on the commercial volumes side, how that progressed and tracked through much of the second quarter? And did you seeing any kind of change in that by the end of the quarter? And then just also want to confirm, no major losses of contract? Nothing when out of network during the quarter? And then any country around the surprise billing legislation? Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Frank, let me try. The quarter, you have to align, we mentioned it before, on our business days. April had a favorable business day. June, you had one less business day. So I normalize for that. But I don't think we, you know, see any intra-quarterly trends of any material nature in the trends that we are talking about. Relative to surprise billing, I don't think there is any new developments out there. We have, you know, worked with various policymakers and industry leaders to express our views on surprise billing and we will see where that ultimately finalizes. But we don't think that's an issue for us in the near term as we as we look at various proposed legislations that out there.
Frank Morgan: Anything about out of network during the quarter?
Bill Rutherford: No. We haven't lost any material contract or any material out of network activity.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank Brian.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now take our next question. It's from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
Josh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate the question. I understand you guys are saying it's really a cost side of the issue and I think I heard a couple of comments around labor. But maybe you could just flesh that out? Was there any increase in temporary labor? Are you seeing any shortages in specific markets, any specific lines, et cetera that caused any potential changes in the volumes? Or is it really steady as she goes on the labor front?
Bill Rutherford: I think it's pretty consistent. When we look at the overall labor trends, as I mentioned in my comments, josh, our productivity improves. We improved just under 1% for the quarter. Our wage rates at 2.6% are in line with our expectations. Our temporary and contract labor has remained stable recent. We are very proud of the efforts our operators are making on that front. We are running nice turnover ratios in there. So again, when we step back and look at the cost trends and when we manage our per unit basis, they are very consistent with our trends. We recognize per as a percentage of revenue, they are showing some growth. But just as in the first quarter when you got really solid commercial growth it helps the per revenue stats and the opposite occurred in the second quarter. But when we look at how we are managing the cost on a volume basis, they are remaining relatively and stable in our view across all categories, labor and supplies, at that standpoint.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you Josh.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now take our next question from Whit Mayo of UBS. Please go ahead.
Whit Mayo: Hi. Thanks, One quick clarification. Can you provide what state supplemental program actually changed and why it was different versus your expectation? And then my real question was just on the Houston market. I think you have recently come out of a rebranding initiative and announced a new affiliation with a large medical school. Just looking for any commentary on the market. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Whit, let me start. The two supplemental programs that were the drivers were a graduate medical education bonus program we had received that didn't reoccur. That was principally in Florida. And then we had a disproportionate share settlement that was principally going back to Colorado in some past years. So those were the two major programs. And then we had a little bit of change in our California supplemental that showed down in our operating expenses. So those were the three. The remaining programs, as we said, we view as stable and we think those issues are behind us. We don't see them creating a headwind going forward on there. And then relative to Houston market, Sam?
Sam Hazen: Yes. We are in a turnaround, I would say, in Houston. We struggled for a couple of years, as we have called out on this call in the past. And I think this year, we have started our recovery and we are seeing pretty good results from some of our initiatives to grow our business. We have seen some results with respect to consolidating some excess capacity. The new acquisition we did in the Northwest side of town is going to be a nice acquisition for us. So all-in-all, the branding, I think, the re-purposing of some assets, the focus that the team has put forth in that market is starting to show results. We think the macros in Houston have turned a little bit where we are starting to see job growth again and see a slightly better payor mix in that market than what we have seen historically. So we are pretty pleased with the first six months of the year's performance in Houston and believe some of the other initiatives, strategically, that we have in place including branding are going to be productive for us. The graduate medical education program that you speak to is in an early stage and has really not yielded anything yet but we think over time, it will be a valuable program for us in the Houston market.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you Whit.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Sarah James: Thank you. I wanted to ask a bigger picture question. So when you talk about seeing competition in the market, how exactly is it presenting today? So are you talking more from surgical referrals, branding or where you sit and ensure efficiency networks and how that presents to the consumer? So if you could give us some color on where the big competition is now in your industry, that would be helpful.
Sam Hazen: Well, I will try to generalize it as best I can. Obviously, it's market-to-market and somewhat competitor-to-competitor. I think the unique thing about HCA and we have mentioned this before, is we don't compete against the same systems from one market to the other. We believe fundamentally that creates competitive advantage for us as we look to deliver best practice solutions from one market to the other or allocate resources in a more timely manner. I think generally speaking, most of our competitors are trying to do a lot of what we are trying to do. They are trying to attract physicians. They are trying to create outpatient capabilities that are responsive to the markets and so forth. And so I think from that standpoint, those are always won and lost in my opinion, when it comes down to execution, when it comes down to detailing your business and your relationships with physicians and so forth and then really creating a compelling offering for the patient. And we think that's in HCA's wheelhouse. And so we have been about that for many years and we will continue to be about that. And we think it's that level of execution and such that ultimately delivers market share gains. Again, we are growing our market share on the inpatient side, as we have mentioned. We have actually grown our market share from a commercial standpoint. We don't have the second quarter of 2019 yet. So we have fairly broad-based market share performance. When you look at the most recent available data, which is all of 2018, we had two-thirds of our markets grow their market share. The company, in total, is at an all-time high on both overall market share as well commercial market share. So we think our approach to building out comprehensive and clinically capable networks that are easy to access for our patients, very responsive to our physicians and produce a positive outcome for our payors, for our patients and others is yielding results and we will continue to focus on that and we will continue to resource that as we move forward and we think that's going to be a successful model for us.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks Sarah.
Sarah James: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question. It's from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Peter Costa: Good morning. My question is on same-store outpatient surgery cases. If I look at Q1, you are up 1.3%. In this quarter, you are up 0.6%. Q1, you should have been negatively affected by the number of days. So this quarter, you would think it will be a little bit stronger. When I look at a year ago, you had a very strong quarter, up 2.6%, in the second quarter. But you had an even stronger quarter in the third quarter for outpatient surgeries. So I am kind of wondering, what happened last year in outpatient surgeries that's perhaps not happening this year, if that's the right way to look at it? And then will the problem be bigger in the third quarter?
Sam Hazen: So let me speak to outpatient surgery. This is Sam. So our hospital-based outpatient surgeries were up 1.9% in the quarter. Our ambulatory surgery center surgical volumes were down 0.6%. And then, our U.K. surgery volumes were down and that influenced sort of the composite. But when you look at our hospital-based outpatient surgery, up almost 2%, that's a pretty good number for us. Some of that was a migration from inpatient in a couple of service lines, as Bill alluded to, but it didn't influence, I think, the aggregate number in any significant way for the company. In the ambulatory surgery center area, we actually categorize our surgical cases into three tiers, Tier 3 being the most significantly reimbursed, Tier 2 in the middle and Tier 1 at the lowest. When you look at our Tier 1 volumes, they were down significantly. That's some ophthalmology cases, some pain cases and so forth. And that's what influenced the metric for the quarter. I don't recall the specifics in the second quarter of last year. But we feel pretty good about what we are doing with our surgical growth initiatives and our quality and investment initiatives inside of our ORs and we have had a fairly good pattern of growth. Over time, it does go up and down a little bit from one quarter to the other. Some of that could be calendar, some of it can be this transition that we spoke to, but generally speaking, we had a pretty good metric this quarter with our outpatient surgeries. Again, inpatient surgeries were the metric of concern for us. They were slightly down. Flattish, if you will, domestically, but down with international. And so that created a little bit of pressure. We will have to continue to work on that and monitor that as we move forward. But all-in-all, our surgical activity on the outpatient side, I think, is yielding pretty good results for the company.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, Pete.
Peter Costa: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now take our next question. It comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning everybody here. So just sticking with the main topic of the day. I am just curious. I mean are you able to comment on whether the inpatient surgical volumes and/or revenue per admission are improving in early 3Q 2019, just following the softer result in 2Q?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. This is Bill. See, we do not comment on the current quarter. So we will leave our comments to the period ending June 30 in the second quarter and year-to-date.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. Maybe just one other quick question here around North Carolina. I mean there's been some headlines around the proposed state employee contract hospital rates for 2020 and the state wants to move to Medicare reference pricing. Obviously, hospitals do not want to do that. I am just curious, first of all, I mean how critical is that contract within North Carolina? If you able to opine on it, is your bias to stay out of network? Or are you willing to potentially agree to like Medicare reference rates knowing that it could kind of filter into other contracts as well? Just curious to get your thoughts around that topic. Thanks.
Bill Rutherford: This is Bill. I will try. I think that's the point. I don't know and I don't have any data in front of me to suggest that if we move to reference for the state employees that it would have a major impact on our North Carolina operations. But I do think from a precedent standpoint, we don't believe having government dictate fixed pricing, especially Medicare pricing, is an appropriate kind of response to managing health care demand. So I think that's where our focus will be on that topic. I don't view it will be a material issue to HCA as we run it up. And as we go through our 2020 planning, if it becomes an item we will disclose it. But I don't think at this point, that particular issue will be a material issue for us.
Steven Valiquette: Got it. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And we will take our next question. It comes from Michael Newshel of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Mark Kimbrough: Michael?
Operator: Michael, your line maybe muted. We will move on. We will now take our next question from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Gary Taylor: Hi. Good morning guys. Just asking this question, certainly in the context that there is normal fluctuation between quarter. So I am kind of beating the dead horse a little bit, but just maybe want to ask a slightly different way. When we look at net revenue per adjusted admission on a same-store basis, I mean, the comps do get a little tougher in 3Q and 4Q. So Sam, when you talk about looking at this, analyzing the quarter, reaching a conclusion that there is not a concern with respect to second half guidance. how much of that is looking at the market specific explanations for some of the commercial softness this quarter and being comfortable with whatever issue that might have been and the trajectory versus some of the new cost initiatives that you have talked about?
Sam Hazen: Well, I answered that, I think earlier. I don't remember who asked it. It may have been Justin. But I do think we are not of the mind yet that our commercial volume growth is flattening out. Again, we have had five quarters in a row, heading into the second quarter where we had inpatient admission growth on commercial activity and six quarters heading into the second quarter and now, seven, if you count outpatient where we have had adjusted admission growth. And so, we don't see anything, again, from a structural standpoint whether it's payor, physician, competitor, what have you that would suggest that our trends should just immediately change. As it relates to pricing trends, as we sequentially move through the rest of the year, we do typically run about third quarter and second quarter very close. And then we ramp up in the fourth quarter through normal contract provisions that we have and so forth. And we don't see anything at this particular point in time preventing us from being able to ramp up in the fourth quarter as we typically do. Obviously, some of our Medicare increase has come through in the fourth quarter as well. As we mentioned earlier, we do have a calendar day advantage in the third quarter that tends to produce more commercial activity because of the type of volume we get typically from commercial activity. So there could be some influence there as we work through the quarter. So we are pretty confident in what I will call the structural aspects of our business. And none of those issues suggest that anything has changed in any material fashion that would cause us concern. And that's why we are reiterating our confidence in our outlook for the rest of the year.
Gary Taylor: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now take our next question. It comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to kind of understand a little bit the rationale for the guidance raise. You mentioned that Q2 came in below expectations and yet you are raising the guidance by $150 million. I assume it sounds like you are just saying that Q1 was so strong, you now feel comfortable with those trends. But just trying to understand maybe a little more color about what exactly came into the guidance. Is there anything new in the second half of the year versus what you were expecting? And I guess, we don't have the final regs, I don't know, if DSH at all change in that assumption, but if there is any change in DSH in there, that would be helpful?
Bill Rutherford: Yes. Kevin, this is Bill. Let me try to take that. After the first quarter, we feel that a lot of questions about our guidance adjustment that we made in the first quarter which, you know, we raised our guidance after first quarter $100 million, which was primarily due to that favorable payer settlement we recorded in the first quarter. We indicated we typically wouldn't raise guidance further after just one quarter, but we did just for that settlement. So obviously now the half of the year is behind us. Well, in essence, we did was tighten our guidance by raising the previous low and about $150 million, which obviously effectively raises the midpoint by $75 million. So as we look at our year-to-date performance, it's an appropriate benchmark, we think, as we have said several times throughout the call for our full year guidance expectations. And if you look at year-to-date, once you adjust for the payor settlement for us, we have grown EBITDA just over 9%. And so our new midpoint suggests just over 9% growth for the second half of the year when you adjust for last year's insurance settlement and the Harvey settlement that we had. So we believe that tightening the guidance range after the second quarter, looking at the midpoint is really consistent with what our year-to-date trends. And so that was really what was behind the tightening and the raising of the midpoint of our guidance after this quarter.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Kevin.
Operator: Thank you. Now we will take our next question. It comes from Matthew Gillmor of Robert W Baird. Please go ahead.
Matthew Gillmor: Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the contribution from recent acquisitions. Did Mission and the 2017 acquisitions contribute about 3% to EBITDA growth again this quarter? Or was that any different? And if you have any sort of general comments about how those deals are going, especially Mission and Savannah, that would be helpful.
Bill Rutherford: Yes. This is Bill. Let me start. So we are very pleased with the performance of the acquisitions and they did have a good quarter. As you mentioned, we anticipated them in our guidance to contribute about 3%. That's what they had in the first quarter. They ran stronger in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we are running about 4% contribution from our acquisitions. Mission, in particular, continues to perform very well. We are ahead of both our internal expectations and plan at Mission. As did Savannah. Savannah is progressing nicely and had a nice growth in the quarter. So overall, the performance is very strong for the acquisition. I think when we look at the full year, we still think 3% to 4% contribution is probably a good number for all the acquisitions. And the Houston market is on track as well with our plans. We have made some adjustments in Houston. Our North Cypress acquisition in that market is performing very nicely. So are overall pleased with the performance of the acquisitions in the quarter and a little ahead of our expectations on a year-to-date basis.
Matthew Gillmor: Thank you.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks Matthew.
Operator: Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. So I would like to hand the call back to our speakers.
Mark Kimbrough: Okay. Listen, I want to thank everybody for joining us today and I will be around if anyone wants to follow up. Thank you so much.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Please standby, we’re about to begin. Welcome to the HCA Healthcare First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Kimbrough: Okay. Thank you, Cody. Good morning, and welcome to all of you on today’s call and our webcast. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen and Bill Rutherford, our CFO, which will provide comments on the company’s results for the first quarter. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that should today’s call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management’s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today’s press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company’s future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Now the company undertakes no obligations to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning’s call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in today’s first quarter earnings release. This morning’s call is being recorded and a replay will be available later on today. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Sam.
Samuel Hazen: All right. Thank you, Mark. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. Earlier today, we reported a great start to 2019. The results for the quarter were driven by strong revenue growth and improvements in operating margin. Revenue grew by almost $1.1 billion, close to 10% in the quarter. This growth was driven by volume growth in commercial business, volume growth in more complex services and new acquisitions. On the same-facilities basis, revenue grew by $700,000, or 6.3%. Inpatient admissions and equivalent admission on a same-facilities basis grew 0.9% and 1.8%, respectively in the quarter. We estimate the flu volumes from last year had an approximate 1% unfavorable impact on our volume growth this year. Volume growth was broad-based across most service categories and balanced across our markets. The growth in revenue translated into solid earnings in the quarter, with diluted earnings per share of $2.97. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 20% to over $2.5 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin at 20.3%. As a result of this quarter’s results, we are raising our guidance for the year. Bill will provide more details on our metrics and updated 2019 guidance in his comments. The first quarter continued the positive momentum we have seen over the past six quarters. Commercial adjusted admissions grew in each of these quarters. Also, we have now grown our same-facilities inpatient admissions in 20 consecutive quarters. The strategic investments in our business to expand our networks and improve our clinical capabilities are making it easier for patients to get high-quality convenient patient care in an HCA Healthcare facility. The most recently available inpatient market share data showed good growth for the company. We grew by over 50 basis points to an all-time high of 25.3%. We have almost $4.3 billion of capital spending in the pipeline that we expect to come online over the next few years. These investments will create additional inpatient and outpatient capacity within our local healthcare systems. We believe that fundamentals in our markets remain strong with growing demand for healthcare services. We also believe we are well-positioned for growth, as we continue to execute our operational initiatives, improve the overall competitive positioning of our local healthcare systems and integrate our acquired hospitals. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of a majority interest in the Galen College of Nursing. We are excited about this pending deal. HCA Healthcare has been investing heavily in nursing over the past few years, so our nurses can be successful and provide the best possible patient care. This investment creates new opportunities for Galen to expand programs into more of our markets. And finally, I want to thank our employees and physicians for their great work in delivering high-quality care to our patients. With that, let me turn the call over to Bill.
William Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the first quarter results, then we will open the call for questions. As Sam mentioned, we are pleased with the first quarter results. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $2.541 billion, up from $2.118 billion last year. As noted in our release, the first quarter of 2019 results include an $86 million increase to our revenues as a result of finalizing an arbitration related to past out-of-network claims. So let me cover some volume steps. During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.4% and 2%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 2.5% and equivalent admissions increased 0.3% in the quarter. Our commercial admissions increased 1.3% and equivalent admissions increased 2.5% on a same-facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self pay and charity admissions were unchanged in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits declined 2.3% in the first quarter compared to the prior year. We attribute about 130 basis points to this year’s weakened flu season. Additionally, when we look at the changes by acuity level, all of the first quarter declines are in our level one through level three visits, which declined 7%. Our higher acuity level four and five visits grew 2.2% over the prior year. In addition, admissions to the emergency room increased by 1.7% over the prior year. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.4% in the quarter. The arbitration settlement accounted for 80 basis points of this increase. We are pleased with the overall rate trends we experienced in the first quarter, as we saw continued growth in acuity, good payer mix, as well as the incremental Medicare update. We believe our visibility around commercial rate remains solid, as we have a significant percentage of our commercial contracts completed for 2019 and 2020 at terms and rates consistent with our recent trends. Now let me turn to expenses. We are pleased with the overall management of expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margins in the first quarter were 20.3%, as reported, and our same facility adjusted EBITDA margins increased 200 basis points over the prior year. On a consolidated basis, total labor cost improved to 120 basis points, supply cost improved 50 basis points and other operating expenses improved 10 basis points. So let me take a moment to talk about earnings per share and cash flow. As reported, diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2019, excluding gains and losses on sale of facilities was $2.97 versus $2.33 in the first quarter of last year. In the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $974 million versus $1.283 billion in the first quarter of last year. The primary item that negatively impacted the year-over-year comparisons was that in the first quarter of 2019, we funded $428 million for our 401(k) match for 2018. This item was included in our 2019 plan and cash flow from operations guidance. Capital spending for the first quarter was $781 million, in line with our expectations. During the first quarter, we paid $278 million to repurchase 2.1 million shares and have $1.995 billion remaining on our previous authorization as of March 31, 2019, Also, as mentioned in our release this morning, our Board of Directors have declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.2 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.71 times. As noted in our release, we increased our 2019 guidance with adjusted EBITDA now expected to range between $9.4 billion and $9.85 billion and earnings per share expected to range between $9.80 and $10.40 per diluted share. Revenue and capital guidance remains unchanged. So that concludes my remarks. I’ll turn the call back to Mark to open it up for Q&A.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Bill. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question, so that we might give as many as possible in the queue today an opportunity to ask a question. Cody, you can now give instructions to those who may want to ask questions.
Operator: Absolutely. Thank you. Today’s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.
Gary Taylor: Hey, good morning. I had a few quantitative questions, but I guess, I’ll just ask the biggest one after such a really strong quarter, at least, dramatically stronger than the Street was expecting. You only raised the annual guidance by $100 million or slightly more than the extent of the arbitration gain. So is there just an abundance of conservatism in the forward guidance, does the Street really have the first quarter just mis-modeled, or is there anything else in the year that gives you a little bit of caution at this point in terms of raising the guidance further?
Samuel Hazen: Okay, Gary. I’ll let Bill take this one.
William Rutherford: Hey, Gary, this is Bill. I’ll start and Sam can add in. So, we typically don’t address guidance after just one quarter, but given our performance, we believe it was appropriate. And as you said, one way to look at it is the raise is due to the payer arbitration, which wasn’t in our original guidance. We continue to see momentum as we saw when we turned the calendar in the core operations and acquisitions improving. As I think about it, if you look at the remaining nine months of the year and after considering that last year we booked some Harvey insurance proceeds in a professional liability, our new reflected guidance has about a 6% growth at the midpoint and almost 9% growth at the high-point. So at this point, we think that’s appropriate. We’ll continue to evaluate it as the year goes on. But I do think we continue to see momentum in the core operating of the business.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Gary.
Gary Taylor: Okay. Thank you.
Samuel Hazen: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now take our next question from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Pito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Nice quarter and thanks for taking my question. First quarter same-store revenue was obviously sort of very strong, and we saw some nice SG&A leverage as expected. Excluding sort of the $86 million from the out-of-network revenue, do you look to see any leverage on the OpEx line? And I’m just curious if you could walk us through if that was due to acquisitions or how we should think about OpEx leverage with same-store revenues on this front?
William Rutherford: Well, I guess, we look – there was operating expense leverage. We had a nice margin expansion for the year. If you look at almost any line item, especially on the same-facility basis, we had 200 basis points margin expansion even on a same-facility basis. So, as we’ve talked about in the past, we’re on the top side of our revenue guidance. We do expect to see margin expansion and indeed, we saw that for the quarter.
Samuel Hazen: Yes. And let me just add a couple of things here, Bill. I mean, we did $700 million at same-stores revenue growth…
William Rutherford: Yes.
Samuel Hazen: …and we cleared about 54% of it to the EBITDA line. So our same-stores EBITDA margin jumped almost 200 basis points, which really is above sort of our expectation on an incremental revenue clearance standpoint. So we’re not seeing the same thing there, Pito that you are seeing. Our overall operating expense per adjusted admission was only up 1.7% on a same-stores basis, again, well underneath our revenue per unit. And so we were pretty pleased and actually quite pleased with the expense metrics for the company.
Pito Chickering: Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Pito.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll hear now from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: Hi. Maybe just – I was actually going to pursue that in a different way. It look like relative to us that your salary and benefits and supply expense, I know you’ve got leverage from outperforming the revenue line, but they look particularly strong in terms of the ratios. Is there any particular initiatives that you’re pursuing that would be worth highlighting there? And I know specifically on the supply side, I think, you announced a – I don’t know if you’ve announced it. But I think there’s a new PBM contract that you have. What – is that going to move the needle for you in any significant way?
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, A.J.
Samuel Hazen: This is Sam, A.J., thank you for that. I think, HCA Healthcare in general is in a constant pursuit of trying to find ways to gain efficiencies and improve profitability. And so I wouldn’t say anything is necessarily that new in our mindset. I mean, we’re constantly finding opportunities. We believe across the company as we get better analytics, as we do better benchmarking and as we come up with technology solutions that we believe can yield value. And so we do have a number of initiatives connected to those three categories. With respect to the PBM relationship, there was an announcement about a transition that will take effect in 2020, and we’ve had a great relationship with CBS in the past. We had a compelling offer put in front of us by Optum and we chose to pursue that, so we’ll transition to that relationship next year. But that’s just part of our ongoing renewal process inside of our supply chain efforts and they do a great job of evaluating different opportunities and different approaches as contracts come up for renewal. But I think our teams are very disciplined in their day-to-day activities. They do a great job of managing variable expenses and then the company is doing a good job in trying to find ways to reduce fixed costs and create a platform that allows revenue growth to really clear to the bottom line appropriately. So we just continue on sort of the same pathway is what I would tell you. Obviously, there’s questions about wages and so forth. We’ve been able to maintain wages around our expectations were slightly under 3%, and we’ve been able to find ways to improve productivity in the face of what I would call decent volume growth and not great volume growth, so that was encouraging. And then we continue to execute on our nursing and human resource initiatives, which are yielding reduced turnover reductions in contract labor, and all that played a part in the performance in the quarter.
A.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, A.J.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan: Good morning. You referenced recent acquisitions in terms of its contribution to your results. Just curious if you could give us a little update on a couple of those recent wins be it Mission or Savannah, Houston. And I noticed that you also talked about a higher-level of CapEx investment, I think, $0.3 billion now, up from $3.5 billion last quarter. Anymore color around where that’s going to be allocated? Is that more into recent acquisitions, just any color there? Thanks.
William Rutherford: Yes. Hey, Frank, this is Bill. Let me start with the acquisition performance and we’re very pleased with the performance of the acquisitions. They’re on plan. First, as you mentioned, Mission is going very well. We’re just two months into it, obviously, but we’re excited for Mission Health to join the HCA network. We’re pleased with how the integration is going and their performance is on plan at this point. Memorial on Savannah had a good quarter, continue to operate on their plan, so very solid performance from Savannah. We’re also very pleased with our performance of our North Cypress facility in Houston. This is also on our plan. So overall, we’re right where we anticipated to be. If you recall, as we had our year-end call, we anticipated the acquisitions to contribute roughly 3% of EBITDA growth in 2019 and they achieved that level in the first quarter. So very pleased with the performance and seem to be on track with what our expectations were. On the capital increase, yes, there is some increased capital related to Mission and then as we continue to see opportunities in the market. But our capital spend and trends are online with what we originally guided.
Samuel Hazen: Yes, but most of that step up, Bill, is related to sort of existing markets. The $3.5 billion, Frank, to the $4.3 billion, there are a few projects that are related to our acquisitions. But most of that is the continuing investments in our existing markets, where we believe we have significant opportunity to improve our network positioning to increase capacity in key areas and drive technology improvements, along certain services lines that we think are differentiators for HCA and we continue to invest in that at this particular point in time.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Frank.
Frank Morgan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now move on to our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.
Peter Costa: Good morning. Nice quarter. A couple of your competitors seem to see a little bit faster medical admissions and a little bit slower growth in surgical admissions. You didn’t seem to have that issue. Could that be, because you’re taking share in the surgical side and the other guys are not taking as much share and there’s just something going on with the market, or do you think it’s just totally separate companies and geographies?
Samuel Hazen: This is Sam. Thank you for that question. Our inpatient surgeries were flat in the quarter. A lot of that was driven by some C-section reductions. But our outpatient surgeries conversely were up and especially inside of our hospital-based outpatient surgery centers, which were up 3 %. So one thing we did have in the first quarter is, we have one less surgical day. And so the calendar is not present what I would call it a favorable calendar and surgical set of days. And so that yielded some pressure on surgery. So if you look at surgery on a per business day standpoint, which is how we look at it, we had really strong surgical activity. I think the company’s efforts around creating what we call the OR of choice has been very productive for us. We’ve been on this journey since 2012 to improve the operations of our surgical suites and appeal to our surgeons in a way that create efficiency, better nursing, better technology offerings and so forth inside of our surgical suites. When you couple that with better improvements inpatient satisfaction, you yield a pretty positive result. The other thing I will tell you is that, some of the deep service line capabilities that we are building or have built are surgically oriented in nature. For example, trauma is heavily surgery-oriented, burn heavily surgery-oriented, cardiovascular, a lot of surgical growth this quarter for us in cardiovascular, and even our robotics investments that we’ve made have been very productive for us as we look at surgery across the line. As I mentioned in my comments, the company has achieved a high watermark on its inpatient market share. We think that’s fairly broad-based across different service lines, which include the surgery components. So we’re very pleased with our surgical initiatives the investments that we’re making, and we think broadly it’s having an impact in the market with our physicians and with our patients and it’s yielding pretty solid growth for us.
Peter Costa: Thank you. And just if I could have a follow-up. Given the strength in surgeries that you’re showing and the strength from the acquisitions, isn’t it time to come off your long-term EBITDA growth rate target of 4% to 6%?
William Rutherford: Well, we’re not ready to do that yet. And so, obviously, this year we guided above that and last year we did perform above that and we’ll have to evaluate that as we get through the rest of this year and look at some of the other factors that are important to long-term guidance. But we hear your point and your question and it’s not a bad question by any means and we’re working our way through it. I think it’s important to understand, we’re pushing 100% on as many fronts as we possibly can. And if we can produce 20% EBITDA growth like we did this quarter, we’ll do that. And so I don’t think the management team is trying to beat down the performance of this company. We’re trying to lift it up wherever we can find it, and we understand the guidance is a part of that, but we will continue to look at that as we move through the rest of the year.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Peter.
Peter Costa: Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.
Mark Kimbrough: All right.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll now take our next question from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI.
Michael Newshel: Thanks. Can you guys comment on the IPPS proposal for 2020 in the company specific impact? And then what does your 2019 guidance assume for the calendar fourth quarter as they reflect the favorable proposal, or a lower more typical average?
Samuel Hazen: Hey, Mike.
William Rutherford: Yes, Mike, this is Bill. I’ll take it. Obviously, we’re looking at that proposal as everybody else is still early, so we haven’t quantified it. We’ll continue to evaluate that as we go through the common period, so no specifics on there. Relative to our guidance, I will say, our guidance anticipate in the fourth quarter that we will return back to kind of a normal Medicare rate update. We did have incredible rate this year that were in that we talked about on our year-end call. So our guidance did presume that we go back to a normal rate. So we’ll have to see what that final IPPS rate turns out to be once we go through the common period. And when we get closer, we’ll comment on the quantification of that.
Michael Newshel: All right. Thank you.
Samuel Hazen: Yes.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.
Ann Hynes: Hi, good morning.
Samuel Hazen: Hi, Ann.
Ann Hynes: Could you give us some detail, I think, the investment in Galen College of Nursing is interesting? How do you think that will improve expenses over time, and maybe when more we see that investment at the income statement? Thanks.
William Rutherford: Thanks, Ann. So the Galen College of Nursing is a very exciting acquisition for HCA Healthcare. This is a very impressive organization. We think their culture lines up great with HCA. Their strategy and their discipline around standardization and how they scale their solutions was very impressive to us. And so we see this as an opportunity to put on the front-end of our nursing agenda, an education component that will allow us to interact with nursing students early on in their journey to be a nurse and hopefully integrate them into the HCA Healthcare network in a way that allows us to source talent for our investments in our growth and so forth. As far as expenses, we see some opportunities to use their platform as we expanded in our broader education initiatives. HCA has a very robust clinical education agenda that’s underway and we see the Galen College of Nursing as being very complimentary and in some cases synergistic with that particular effort. We haven’t put a number to that as of yet. We have to close this deal hopefully by the end of this year through a regulatory process that we’re going through currently. But once we get through that, we’re going to be fairly quick in trying to expand their model into different HCA markets, so that we can get moving on it. But we don’t have any numbers yet specifically on expense synergies, but we do think it’s going to create opportunities for us to enhance the pipeline of nurses into our company.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, Ann.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Matthew Gillmor with Robert W. Baird.
Matthew Gillmor: Hey, thanks. Following up on Peter’s question, can you quantify the calendar impact on volumes? And then did the Hurricane Michael have any lingering impact on the Panama facility that impacted overall volumes at all?
Samuel Hazen: This is Sam. Thank you for that question. On the second part of your question, the short answer is no. Our Gulf Coast, the Medical Center in Panama City, that’s an incredible group of people down there in what they went through and how quickly they rebounded, and I want to take the opportunity since you asked the question to thank them again for everything they’ve done. So we’re up and running fully at that particular hospitals. So our corporate teams, our local teams, other markets supported that hospital in getting up and running, so it had no impact on the quarter, as it relates to volume. I think the way we look at surgery, especially on the outpatient side, almost 95% to 98% of all outpatient surgeries are done on weekdays. So when you look at one less week day in the quarter and then you put the outpatient surgeries on top of that, you can get the sense of what our per calendar day or business day rather surgical volumes were – I’m not doing the math here on my phone, but nonetheless I’ll give you some sense of it. On the inpatient surgery side, it’s not as much. We do surgeries on the weekends, mainly for emergency patients, but it’s a small number. So I think the inpatient surgeries are also influenced by the business day calendar, but not nearly as much as the outpatient. And then you have the same kind of impact on cardiology business, which the company had tremendous cardiology growth in the quarter. Our cardiac volumes were up 3% on the procedures side. Our electrophysiology volumes were up 5%, again, that’s in the face of a business calendar that was a little softer than the previous year, and our cardiovascular surgeries were up 4%, so very solid growth in that particular service line as well. And I think, again, somewhat impacted by the calendar, but we overpowered that as we went through the quarter.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, Matt.
Matthew Gillmor: Got it. Thanks, Sam.
Samuel Hazen: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Whit Mayo with UBS.
Whit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Sam, I don’t want to jump the shark, but assuming that we may see some CON law changes in Florida, maybe mostly around some tertiary services. What does this mean for HCA?
Samuel Hazen: We have not seen the final rules on the CON regulation changes in Florida as of yet. Florida is fairly relaxed currently on a lot of their CON rules. There is no restrictions of any significance on expansion of existing facilities. There are opportunities to do certain outpatient facilities without certificate of need requirements. So it is gradually relaxed itself over the years. I mean, the opportunity for us would be new hospitals, potentially in certain markets. It would also mean new programs, for example, rehab is a very restrictive CON process today, so our opportunity to get into that service line would be potentially available to us if the CON rules are changed on that front. And then there’s a few other programs where there are some restrictions that as we understand it could be relaxed. So we’ll learn more as this bill continues to progress through the legislative process.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now take our next question from…
Whit Mayo: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup.
Samuel Hazen: Hey, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe: Hey, good morning. Are there more of these larger arbitration cases outstanding? I know they happen from time to time, just trying to get a sense of whether there’s more of a bullish at this point? And with the out-of-network related to exchanges specifically, or was it broader commercial and over what period of time? Thanks.
William Rutherford: Yes, Ralph, this is Bill. From time to time, we have discussions and disputes with payers that result in arbitration and this was one of those, I can’t say that there’s a big one now that we see near-term. This did relate to health insurance exchange activity in the early periods of health reform, principally 2015, 2015, with a little bit of 2016.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Ralph.
Operator: We’ll now move on to our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to dig into the margin improvements, because that seems to be where the biggest surprise, and I guess maybe labor in particular. I guess, we’re all kind of assuming that as the economy keeps improving that wages are going up and that this will be more of a pressure on you going forward, but really good labor cost growth in the quarter. So I just want to understand what was driving that and how you think about that number tracking through the year?
William Rutherford: Well, I spoke to most of the details a minute ago on labor and how we viewed it. Again, if you look at same stores for the company, our labor costs were up 3.6% on revenue growth of 6.3%. We were able to find some productivity inside of that and manage our wages, as I said, under 3%. So we had good reductions in contract labor. And I just think overall, really well managed by our facilities. Obviously, when we have commercial volume and we have high intensity volume, we aren’t using a ton of marginal cost to support that. We’re using some marginal cost for sure, but because it’s got more revenue turnover and more revenue yield per patient, if you will, it clears more effectively. And that shows itself in the margin expansion that I mentioned as well earlier in the call and it shows itself significantly in labor as well when you figure roughly 50% of our labor costs in HCA are fixed in nature. And so to the extent, we have some volume growth, but really good volume growth as far as the mix of that volume. It clears itself pretty effectively through the different expense categories, and that’s what we saw in the first quarter. As it relates to the rest of the year, we’re not anticipating anything significantly different with respect to labor pressures. We continue to execute the multiple agendas that we have to improve our environment for our employees. So it’s a better place to work and more attractive to them, and we don’t see any unusual cost pressures coming from that.
Kevin Fischbeck: Thanks to hear them.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.
Josh Raskin: Thanks. I appreciate, guys, taking the call – the question. I guess, it’s been a little while since we’ve talked about taking risk. And I’m just curious if you’re seeing any changes in the market or payer expectations or even in the HCA side in terms of your appetite to be taking more risk, and I guess sort of attitudes from payers, et cetera, everything along that line?
Samuel Hazen: This is Sam. Thank you for that question. Nothing in our view has changed materially across our 43 different markets. We continue to interact with the payers, I think, very effectively and strategically in many instances. I think the approach that we take to building on our network with various outpatient facilities that have different price points is productive for the payers and at the same time very convenient and efficient and satisfying for our patients. That’s been effective for us. We do have some contracts where they’re value-based provisions in them and so forth. I think what people fail to recognize is that, HCA on a roughly 75% to 80% of its inpatient admissions takes a former risk. In that, we get DRG payments or we get a case rate payment on a particular patient and it’s our responsibilities to manage efficiently underneath that. And so we are taking forms of risk. We’re not taking risk outside of the walls of the hospital in any material way, because we don’t feel we’re in a position to control that or influence that or even price that necessarily. So our approach has been to focus on risk parameters that we can control that we have some visibility into and then be a really productive partner for the payers by meeting their needs with different facility offerings with very efficient high-quality outcomes that don’t result in readmissions or don’t result in infections or longer lengths of stay and such. And so that’s been our approach, and we think that generally is workable with the payers. So we are really seeing any significant changes broadly across the marketplace.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Josh.
Josh Raskin: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Scott Fidel with Stephens.
Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. I’m interested if you could just touch on some of the key factors that drove the year-over-year change in operating cash flows, particularly as it relates to the DSOs and then maybe update us just on anything to call out around the quarterly cadence of operating cash flow over the remainder of the year?
Samuel Hazen: Hi, Scott, thanks.
William Rutherford: Yes, Scott, this is Bill. So as I called out in my comments, the most significant item that affected the year-over-year cash flow was our 401(k) match that we funded in the first quarter related to 2018. There were a couple other items that affected it. The payer settlement we spoke to went into receivables in the first quarter, we’ve subsequently collected that in April. With the Mission AR acquisition, there were some increased receivables just given we were two months into that, both of those were in the $80 million range. So when we adjust for those or cash flow from ops is right on track. We continue to believe for the full-year, cash flow from ops will range between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. And so we feel good about where the company is positioned on that. I think as the company continues to see some growth in earnings, we’ll see that growth in cash flow operations as well.
Samuel Hazen: So our original guidance was $6.5 billion to $7 billion…
William Rutherford: $6.5 billion to $7 billion, yes, and we really continue to believe that’s the proper guidance for HCA.
Samuel Hazen: Correct. Okay. Scott, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Valiquette with Barclays.
Samuel Hazen: Steve?
Operator: Mr. Valiquette, we aren’t able to hear you. Please check your mute function. Again, sir, please check your mute function, we aren’t able to hear you.
Steven Valiquette: Hello.
William Rutherford: Hey, Steve.
Steven Valiquette: Hey, sorry [indiscernible] and I turned on the cellphone. I hope, you can hear me.
Samuel Hazen: Yes, go ahead.
Steven Valiquette: I just want to follow-up. Okay. So just separate from the surgery discussion earlier, there has been discussion this quarter among your peers softer same-store revs per adjusted admission that maybe happening for other reasons as well that you guys obviously had pretty good results in 1Q 2019 on that metric and now there’s a ton of variables that go into that metric. But I’m just wondering if you are able to comment on the durability of your results there just for the rest of 2019 just to give investors more confidence around, again, this same-store revs per adjusted admission metric for HCA for the full-year? Thanks.
Samuel Hazen: Thanks, Steve. I think, obviously, we benefit from commercial volume growth, and our commercial volume growth, like I said, we’ve had six consecutive quarters of adjusted admission growth in our Commercial segment and that yielded strong revenue per adjusted admission. The second thing I would say is, as we build out service line capability and deepen our programs broadly across the organization, that yields more revenue per patient Those are the two factors that drove our revenue per unit up above where maybe people expected. And we’ve had a pretty good pattern with that. I think in 2018, if I remember correctly, we were north of 3%, and that again is a function of those two variables. Also when you look at our case mix, our case mix trends, which is not a perfect proxy for acuity, but a good one is actually trending north of 3% as well. So we continue to invest in both of those components of our business. We have numerous initiatives that are geared toward being more accessible for the commercial population. We have more outpatient investments that are geared towards that. Also, in the service line standpoint, we continue to build out capabilities across the company’s portfolio. And again, those things still think have room to grow. And as we see continued momentum in the markets with job growth and strong economies, we think that portends reasonably well for us over the course of 2019.
Steven Valiquette: Okay. I appreciate your best color. Thanks.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs.
Steve Tanal: Good morning, guys. Actually was – I wanted to follow-up on that one. I guess, the quarter itself was quite good. Clearly, the commentary is very bullish. And so I guess the question would be, is there anything that could potentially move you back into the guidance range on revenue per adjusted admit that’s 2 to 3 for the year? Does it seem like pretty likely to be tracking above?
William Rutherford: Well, we’ll have to see. There’s obviously quarter-to-quarter trends we have. But as you’ve heard us talk about, we feel there’s a lot of momentum in the growth prospects of the company. As Sam just mentioned, good commercial growth really helps drive that. We continue to invest in higher acuity services. So, we do anticipate continued strength in the revenue portfolio and the composition of the company. So I think for the near-term, we might be above that, but we’ll just have to see what the future quarters yield.
Steve Tanal: Appreciate that. And maybe just lastly, from anything just on the M&A pipeline, any comments there? How was that looking? Are there still opportunities out there? Have you slowed the pace? Any color would be helpful? Thank you.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thanks, Steve.
William Rutherford: Well, I wouldn’t say that we have anything to report on at this particular point in time. It’s our judgment. And I mentioned this, I think, on the last call or maybe the call before that, we could be entering a cycle where there are some nice opportunities for the company. We are having discussions, but they’re early discussions with different systems that are exploring their options as they look at their future and their situation. Most of those are independent not-for-profit systems that we think have some appeal. And so we will continue those conversations to say that there are any more than we’ve had in the past, I really can’t say that. But I do think we are entering a period of time, where we could see more than we’ve seen in the past.
Steve Tanal: Great. Thank you.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Anagha Gupte with SVB Leerink.
Anagha Gupte: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So very impressive quarter. You continue to impress and you decouple from the rest of the hospital operators on growth and all the metrics. So, my questions are really about how much of this is even secular anymore relative to the HCA playbook? And I can ask many, but two quick ones would be your commercial mix has been very impressive. You had once, I think, a year ago maybe talked about market specific population growth probably in a better employment in your markets. Is that anymore, or is it just shaking, because you’re investing so well in service lines and I mean, all of that and with your physicians? And then secondly, on the pricing growth, also, the rates in the payer mix and acuity, but you’re much better than everyone else. And is it also, because you have an unparalleled asset base across the inpatient assets, your 2000-plus sort of access points that you’re buildings towards? So you have the ability to optimize your payer mix and your acuity by sight of service, if you will, any comments on that?
Samuel Hazen: All right. Thank you, Anagha.
William Rutherford: I’m not in a position to speak to the other companies and their results. What I can speak to is how we approach the market and what it takes for us to compete in these large metropolitan markets. And typically, we are competing against a local not-for-profit system or to most of which are only in that particular market, very few of them are what I would call portfolio market players. So we have to adjust our approach to deal with those local nuances. But we have been very effective in transporting ideas, transporting initiatives and investing aggressively in our growth agenda across the company. And our results are broad based. Our market share on the commercial is at an all-time high. We grew our market share on the commercial book actually slightly better than we grew our overall market share in the in this last report that we’ve got, so that’s very encouraging. We continue to believe we’re doing the right things, again, from a payer standpoint and relating to them and finding ways to be a solution for them and at the same time creating an efficient and satisfying experience for the patient. So a lot of our commercial revenue is on the outpatient side. We invest in that. We try to create programs that make it easy for the patients to navigate. And so, we’ll continue down that pathway, because we think it works. And so that’s really what we’re seeing. It’s hard for me to compare against the other companies, because I don’t get to see their results like I do ours nor do I understand their business model to the same degree, as I understand our competitors across our markets.
Mark Kimbrough: All right. Thank you, Anagha.
Anagha Gupte: Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll hear now from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.
Matthew Borsch: Yes. Just two question on the trend in your services and the demographics. As you look at the weighting towards cardiac services this quarter and, on the other hand, the fewer C-sections that you had. Is that – are we talking aging of the population on the one hand and the very, very low birth rate on the other? And I’m just curious how you see that developing, given that the vanguard of the baby boom generation is now in the early 70s.
Samuel Hazen: So there’s two pieces. This is Sam. Thank you for the question. There are two pieces to that question. On the cardiac side, we have seen strong cardiology volume trends even in the fourth quarter, I think, we were up about 5%. And so we’re up again about that same level, and that really goes to our service line strategy, which is led by a team up here in Nashville, who supports our field teams in physician recruitment, program development, technology, deployment, patient navigation, all of those kind of things, and we think that has allowed us to attract physician talent and add program capacity and that’s yielding volume gains for us across the board in cardiology. In the obstetrics world, what’s interesting in this quarter, our commercial obstetrics volume was up about 6%. Our Medicaid volume was down significantly. And so that’s what drove sort of the overall blend of the metrics and yielded some reductions in C-section. We do see birth rates flattening out across the country. We’ve spoken to that before. And our approach to women services has been to really create destination sites in most of our markets, where physicians and moms want to go, because we have the facilities, the physician capability, the nursing capability and so forth that creates a very positive environment. And that’s working for us in markets, where we’ve made those investments. And we’ll continue to look at, again, transporting that idea more broadly, so that we can pick up market share. I think for the most recent report, our market share in obstetrics is actually flat, but that where we’ve lost it is again in the Medicaid side of the equation and not so much on the commercial side.
Matthew Borsch: Thank you.
Mark Kimbrough: Thanks, Matt. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our next question from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.
Jesse Klink: All right. This is Jesse on for Sarah. Thanks for taking the question. So on the last call, you highlighted that 80% of hospitals grew even, say, year-over-year, 70% for admissions year-over-year, 65% of hospitals grew outpatient surgery year-over-year. So all in 2018 was really good year. Just wondering how that’s trending so far in 2019? If it makes a difficult comp at all, do you still think there’s room for improvement among those facilities? And then if there is room for improvement, just what could that mean for the kind of 2% to 3% volume growth and 4% to 6% EBIT growth guidance? Thanks.
William Rutherford: Well, we had a really strong portfolio performance again in the first quarter of 2019. It was very similar to the metrics that you just delineated. We had 75% of our hospitals that had year-over-year EBITDA growth. We had 54% have admission growth. Now some of that is because of the flu season and the impact that the flu season last year had on our year-over-year comparisons. But nonetheless, that’s a pretty powerful metric in my judgment given that we had one less business calendar day or one less business day and then we had the impact of the flu from the previous year. Emergency room volume was a little softer than what I recorded – reported last year and, again, I think that’s due to the flu. But all in all, we had a really strong portfolio performance pretty much across the Board, so we’re very pleased with the execution of our strategies by our management teams across the Board.
Samuel Hazen: Okay, great. Thank you. Hey, Cody, we’ve got time for two more questions, okay?
Operator: Absolutely. We’ll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. Sam, I guess my question for you. As I think about your physician strategy, are you looking at piloting or pursuing any new approaches to in-hospital physician practice ownership? And then, again, as we think about the M&A pipeline, how does that relate to that in terms of your appetite for acquiring in-hospital practices at this point?
Samuel Hazen: Well, we continue to add to our physician services group physician practices. I think, we’re over 5,000 physician practices in – or 5,000 physicians roughly 1,200, 1,400 clinics across the company, and that’s growing it roughly 8% to 10% per year. So that’s an ongoing trend that we think is part of our success, but at the same time part of creating an offering for our patients and for our payers that works. As it relates to hospital-based physicians, specifically, we are exploring approaches to deal with some of the pressures that exist in the marketplace. We have today hospital-based physician practices that are owned by HCA. For critical care medicine, we may have the largest or the second largest critical care medicine practice in the country. We also have a very large pathology practice inside of HCA that’s growing. We are exploring hospital as we’re exploring emergency room physicians. We’re exploring anesthesia in ways that are maybe different than what we’ve done in the past. We don’t have anything today to report as to exactly what that’s going to be. How that will impact acquisitions in the futures? I don’t think it will be a material impact on any acquisitions. It could be synergistic on the margins for some acquisitions in the future if we do have a different approach there. But at this point in time, it’s not really that material.
Brian Tanquilut: All right. Thank you.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Brian. We’ve got one more.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our follow-up from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.
Pito Chickering: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the follow-up here. Quick question, case mix, I guess, quantify that increasing at 3% in the first quarter? Did you disclose the same-store case mix? And also it’s increasing over the past three years and mostly due to our CapEx investments. With the amount of CapEx spend in the process, is it fair to think the case mix growth shouldn’t slow anytime in the next two to three years?
William Rutherford: Yes, Peter, this is Bill. Our case mix index for the first quarter was 2.6%...
Samuel Hazen: Same facility…
William Rutherford: …on a same facility basis on there, a lot of service line variables on there. I don’t know whether it will slow or not as we’ve talked about our focus, both from capital as well as the program development, Sam has alluded to throughout the call, is to continue to grow our high acuity and high intensity services. So, we’ve been in a period where we’ve been north of that for some period of time in this 3 to 4. I said before, 2 to 3 likely might be a long-term settlement – settle period. But as we continue to invest capital in the high acuity, as our program development is focused on the high acuity, I wouldn’t be surprised if we still see a robust case mix index for us.
Pito Chickering: Thank you very much.
William Rutherford: Okay. Cody?
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Kimbrough for any additional or closing remarks.
Mark Kimbrough: Okay, great. Listen, I want to thank, everyone, who participated today. Thanks for your interest in HCA, and I’ll be around the office if you need any additional follow-up. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the HCA Healthcare Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Chief Investment Relations Officer, Mr. Mark Kimbrough. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, April. Good morning and welcome to all of you on today's call or webcast. With me this morning is our CEO, Sam Hazen and Bill Rutherford, our CFO which will provide comments on the company's results and 2019 guidance provided in today's earnings release. Before I turn the call over to Sam, let me remind everyone that today's call containing forward-looking statements. They are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risk, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future results. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses, gains on sales of facilities, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. is to adjust EBITDA is included in today's fourth quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded and replay of the call will be available later today. I'll now turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. We finished the year with the strong quarter and ahead of our expectations. Solid volume increases and strong revenue growth drove this quarter's results, which were consistent with all 2018. In patient admissions and equivalent admissions on a same facility basis grew almost 2% respectively in a quarter. Volume growth was broad based across most service category and balanced across our diversified portfolio market. Revenues on a same facility basis grew by 6.4% were almost $700 million. Our strategy to deliver services that are more complex supported this growth along with the good payer mix and stable commercial pricing. Revenue per equivalent admission grew by 4.4%. The growth in revenue translated into strong earnings quarter with diluted earnings per share of $3.01. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 6.2% to slightly over $2.5 billion with adjusted EBITDA margin at 20.4%. Cash flows were also very strong and ahead of our expectations. Bill will provide more details on these metrics and 2019 guidance in his comments. 2018 was another strong year for HCA Healthcare. We have now grown our same facilities inpatient admissions in 19 consecutive quarters. The strategic investments in our business to expand our network and improve our clinical capabilities are making it easier for patients to get high quality, convenient patient care in an HCA facility. We have an excess of $3.5 billion of capital spending in the pipeline that should come online over the next two years. These investments will create additional inpatient and outpatient capacity within our local healthcare systems. As I stated in last quarter's call, we believe that fundamentals in our markets are strong with growing demand for healthcare services. That's coupled with the continual improvement in the competitive positioning of our local healthcare systems gives us confidence as we move into 2019. Inpatient market share in 2018 grew by 45 basis points as compared to 2017 reflecting this improvement. As indicated in our earnings release, our Board of Directors has authorized an additional share repurchase program for up to $2 billion of the company's outstanding shares. Additionally, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share which is an increase of 14%. Lastly, we are excited about the expected closing at the end of January on the acquisition of Mission Health which is the large successful Health System in Asheville, North Carolina. This system will add to the already strong portfolio of markets that we have inside of HCA Healthcare. With that, let me turn the call over to Bill for more details.
Bill Rutherford: Great, thanks Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results, and review our 2019 financial guidance. Then we'll open the call for questions. Sam mentioned, we are pleased with the fourth quarter results, as well as for the full year. Volume, intensity and great expense management led to a solid quarter and a strong finish to the year. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 6.2% to $2.508 billion, up from $2.362 billion last year. We believe this was a solid result considering the strength of the fourth quarter of 2017. As noted in our release, we did have some hurricane activity that impacted our results in the quarter. First, we estimate the impact of Hurricane Michael which unfavorably impacted our Florida Panhandle facilities, mostly Gulf Coast Medical Center and Panama City Beach to be about $31 million in the quarter. Also, we recorded a $49 dollar benefit to adjusted EBITDA from settling our insurance coverage related to hurricane Harvey business interruption that personally affected our Houston market in the third quarter of 2017. So let me cover some volume stats. In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.9% over the prior year. And same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.9% as well. We estimate the impact of hurricane Michael and decline in flu activity from last year had a 50 basis unfavorable impact on same facility admissions in the quarter. For the year, both same facility admission and equivalent admission grew 2.5% over the prior year. During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2% and 2.5% respectively. This included both traditional and managed Medicare. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 0.8% and equivalent admissions declined 0.7% in the quarter. Our commercial admissions increased 1.1% and equivalent admissions increased 1.6% on a same facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self pay and charity admissions increased 7.4% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits decreased 2.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. We attribute about 60 basis points to last year's full season. Additionally, when we look at the changes by equity level, all of the fourth quarter declines are in level one through three visits. Our higher equity level four and five visits grew 1.1% over the prior year. In addition, admissions in the emergency room grew 1.9% over the prior year. Same facility revenue for equivalent admission increased 4.4% in the quarter and was up 3.9% for the year. We are pleased with the overall rate trends we experienced in 2018 as we saw continued growth in equity, good payer mix, as well as the incremental Medicare update in the fourth quarter. We also believe we are well positioned in our commercial contracting segment as we look forward to 2019. We don't expect any major changes in this environment. We have good visibility into our 2019 commercial contracts where we are 80% contracted in rates consistent with our recent trends. Now turning to expenses. We are pleased with the overall management of expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter were 20.4% as reported and our same facility margins increased 10 basis points over the prior year. For full year 2018, our same facility adjusted EBITDA margins increased 70 basis points with labor improving 30 basis points, supply cost improving 30 basis points and our other operating cost improving 10 basis points. So let me take a moment to talk about earnings per share and cash flow. As reported, diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter excluding gains and losses on sale facility and losses on retirement of debt was $2.99 versus $1.30 in the fourth quarter of last year. Year-to-date as reported diluted earnings per share excluding the impact on gains and losses on sale facilities and losses on retirement of debt was $9.77 versus $6 in 2017. In addition to the solid operating performance of the company, the decrease in our income tax provision was contributor to the diluted earnings per share increases both for the fourth quarter and the year. As Sam mentioned, cash flow was very strong for the company. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $2.18 billion versus $1.73 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. For full year 2018, cash flow from operations was $6.76 billion or an increase of $1.33 billion from $5.43 billion last year. Capital spending for the year was $3.57 billion in line with our expectation. Cash flow from operations of $6.671 billion, less capital spending of $3.573 billion and distributions to non-controlling interest of $441 million and our dividend payments of $487 million resulted in free cash flow of $2.260 billion in 2018. Also during the year, we completed approximately $1.5 billion of share repurchases and had $272 million remaining on our previous authorization as of December 31st, 2018. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.7 billion available on our revolving credit facilities and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.7x. This cash flow and balance sheet metrics continue to be an important strength of the company. So with that I'll move into the discussion of our 2019 guidance. We highlight our 2019 guidance in our earnings release this morning and noted our guidance does include the anticipated impact of the Mission Health acquisition which we expect to close on January 31st, 2019. We estimate our 2019 consolidated revenue should range from $50.5 billion to $51.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $9.35 billion and $9.75 billion. With our revenue estimate we estimate same facility equivalent admission growth to range between 2% and 3% for the year. And same facility revenue for equivalent admission growth to range between 2% and 3% for 2019 as well. We anticipate same facility operating expense per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5% to 3%. Our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 352 million shares for the year and earnings per diluted share guidance for 2019 is projected to be between $9.60 and $10.20. There are several items affecting our year-over-year diluted EPS comparisons including the third quarter impact of professional liability reserve adjustment of $0.15. Hurricane Harvey settlement of $0.11. And adjustment to our deferred tax balances of $0.19 and the expected differences in the benefit of excess equity reward settlement of $0.35 in 2018 versus $0.23 estimated in 2019. Adjusted for these items, our diluted earnings per share guidance reflects an approximate 8% growth at the midpoint. Relative to other aspects of our guidance, we anticipate cash flow from operations between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. We anticipate capital spending of $3.7 billion in 2019 which includes anticipated capital spending from Mission. We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.5 billion and interest expense to be approximately $1.9 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. Sam mentioned in his comments, we also announced an increase of our quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program. Both of these are reflection of management's belief in the long-term performance of the company. The confidence we have in the strength of our cash flow and our commitment to a balanced allocation of capital. So that concludes my remarks. And I'll turn the call over to Mark to open it up for questions.
Mark Kimbrough: Thank you, Bill. [Operator Instructions] April, you may now give instructions to those who want to ask questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take first question Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
JustinLake: Thanks. Good morning. So given the solid quarter and all the detail, the question I had here was just on 2019. And two things, one, year-over-year your EBITDA growth that you talked about in the third quarter expected the growth to be about similar to 2018. The guidance is very much in line with kind of what you talked about in the third quarter but doesn't appeared to be fully reflect the upside that you saw in Q4 from really strong results. So I just wanted to see if you could kind of give us any thoughts there in terms of, did that carry forward or should it in the guidance? And then can you tell us anything about the revenue and EBITDA impact you expect from Mission in 201? Thanks.
BillRutherford: Justin, this is Bill. I'll take that call. So as we look at our 2019 guidance, we believe it's consistent what we talked about on our third quarter call. Obviously reflecting our continued strong performance and the core operation of the companies along with the expected improvements and the performance of our acquisitions. So let me just give you few more details. First, if you look at the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance roughly $9.55 billion that equation almost a 7% on as reported basis that we finished 2018. And then in 2018, if you adjust for the $70 million positive malpractice adjustment and the $49 million insurance settlement that we don't think we will repeat, if you adjust for these items we were 8.2% at the midpoint for 2018 guidance. About 3% of this growth is from our acquisitions with 2% from our 2017 and 2018 acquisition and Mission coming about 1% of that growth. So that leads a little above 5% of the balance in the expected same facility growth as we continue to anticipate volume to demand capital investments, strategy execution and so forth. So we think all of that is reflected in our 2019 guidance.
Operator: We will move on to our next question from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
PitoChickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks and great quarter. I just follow up adjustment I want -- just try to back into the strong same store margin leverage that you guys are talking about. Growth for 2019 of 4% to 6%, same store expense growth is 2.5% to 3.5%. Can you just sort of help us think about sort of what you guys need from same store revenue perspective to maintain your margins, where you got need to grow and kind of how should we be thinking about excess of the maintenance growth sort of how to converse to margin leverage for 2019.
BillRutherford: Pito, thanks. Let me make a stab at that and so we are all pleased with the margin growth as I said the same facility margin growth for the year is up 70 basis points. I think that's a continued reflection of our operating leverage. We said for sometime within the 46% kind of same facility revenue range we are on high end of that. We do anticipate some margin leverage and we are seeing that. We saw that in the fourth quarter with 10 basis points increase on a same facility basis. So we feel generally comfortable with that as we roll up our consolidated or our acquisitions are put a little pressure on the as reported margin. So we do anticipate some margin expansion if we can achieve at the top end of that revenue range. And I think again we are very pleased with our performance through 2018. And we will see what 2019 holds.
SamHazen: Yes. This is Sam. The only thing I would add to that is as we look into 2019, we are not seeing any unusual pressures on any category of expenses. And so if we are able to achieve the volume expectation that we've guided toward that can yield I think the operating leverage that Bill was alluding to. So that's the good news on the expense side. There is not any excessive pressures in any category of our overall spending.
Operator: We will take our next question from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
A.J.Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just drill down on the capital spending that's been part of the story for the last couple years. Can you just comment couple aspects? Any evolving areas of spending that are different that we've seen in the last two years? And your commercial business really sort of seemed to pick up this year. Is that you think more company specific because of these capital spending or is that underlying market improvement?
SamHazen: This is Sam A J. Let me take those two questions. First, I think our capital program is fairly consistent when you look at 2018, you look at 2017 and then you look at what's coming online in 2019 and 2020. I think in general it's consisting of adding capacity and facilities where we have constraint in our operating at a high level of utilization. So that could be inpatient bed, critical care bed, operating room suites and so forth. And just to give you a metric of company finished the year almost 73%, well over 72% occupancy for our hospital beds which is a very high number. And that's over and above where we were at 2017. And we also had a few additional beds that came online in 2017. The second component of our spending is around building our network in our outpatient capabilities so that we are very convenient and easy to access. So we've added surgery centers. We've added three standing emergency room, urging care centers, clinics and other diagnostic capabilities to really support a comprehensive opportunity for patients to access an HCA Healthcare system. Those are small dollar capital items and they don't consume a huge amount of our budget. So they are very efficient from that standpoint. The final component of our investments, I think that really geared towards our growth are centered around technology, clinical technology that our physicians want. And the more we can add clinical technologies that support our practices and our physicians' need, it allows us to grow the complexity of our services, have a very capable clinical technology platform for our physicians to take care of our patients. And we think the combination of all of those are helping us respond to the marketplace and drive market share growth. On the commercial side, through the first six months of 2018, commercial demand was modestly down. But HCA picked up significant commercial market share to the tune of probably more growth over the last nine months than we've seen in the recent past. And so our commercial growth is more function of market share gain globally across the company than it is necessarily overall demand. Although in a number of our markets we've seen commercial demand lift a little bit over where it was but as a total for the company was modestly down. Not significantly by any means not like it was in the previous year. But it was not growing significantly but the company through these programmatic efforts through our capital spending, I think through being more responsive to our physicians and medical staff dynamics, we've been able to take care of more patients and take care of them more effectively. A J I think --
Operator: And we will take our next question from Whit Mayo from UBS. Please go ahead.
WhitMayo: Hey, thanks. Just want to go back to the expense question for a minute. You've been operating and you are in an environment for sometime now with what I would characterize is fairly low inflation entering the cost structure. Can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more on trends and expectations specifically for contract labor, premium pay, professional fees? And, Sam is there anything that surprises you as you reflect back on 2018 as it relates to your ability and your team's ability to manage expenses so tightly?
BillRutherford: Yes. Whit, this is Bill. I'll start and then Sam can add answer. So if you look at the overall cost structure, you said we remained very pleased with the trends we're seeing there, 2.5% to 3% range. If you start with labor, very pleased with the labor trends. We've had some benefits or reduced contract labor as you mentioned as our teams continue to focus on reducing our turnover. I think our nursing turnover is at low 4s and that has proven the benefit us on the premium labor side. And that's flowing through as some favorable trends on the salary costs. But we see generally wage rates in line with our expectation. So, I've always and continue to characterize as fairly consistent trends right now. We see the same going into 2019. We continue to be very pleased with the team's execution on the supply cost agenda. As I mentioned, we were 30 basis points down on same facility on supply cost as we continue to see great efforts by HPG and the contract team and our supply team is focusing and partnering with our clinical teams on supply utilization. So very pleased with both of those. And as we turn the calendar into 2019, we think largely those trends should continue and I think Sam mentioned earlier, we don't see any really singular undue pressure point right now. We are always subject to some cyclical trends. But we feel very pleased with how we are turning the calendar on the cost side.
SamHazen: This is Sam. On the last question there, Whit, I mean the management teams of HCA are incredible. I mean I am constantly amazed by what our teams out in the field do. They continue to add to our agenda to improve our patient care. They continue to add to add to our agenda to improve relationships with physicians. And they continue to find ways to grow and manage their metrics at the highest level. And I think that's something that's unique about HCA. We have what I call can do management team out in the field. They relentlessly pursue execution and performance. And I think it shows in the overall consistency of the company's performance. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've grown our admissions over the last 19 quarters consecutively. And I don't remember the exact number but if you go back over time, we continue to grow our volume very consistently and really navigate through different kind of market dynamics, competitive dynamics, cyclical changes and so forth. And continue to grow the company. So I am really pleased with what our management team have done and what I know they will continue to do as we look forward.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
SteveTanal: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. So hoping you could maybe just give us a little bit more color maybe parse out the drivers of the acceleration at revenue per adjusted admit, especially the Medicare rate, as you know that update was positive. And then any color on why that would be decelerate somewhat meaningfully like in the outlook right 140 and 240 bps I suppose for Q2 to the full year with so much of the commercial book contracted. Any color there would be helpful.
BillRutherford: Yes. Let me attempt it. So we are pleased with how we finished the year on revenue per admit. And if you look at year-to-date, we are at 3.8% on a same facility basis. We were benefited by the Medicare update in the fourth quarter. And as we've said before, a continuing benefit built into 2019. So and we do have good visibility into the commercial contract team. We expect to see continued growth in equity and good payer mix. So I think this year we are helped by the strong commercial volume the Sam talked to, continued growth in equity. And that's led us to be a little bit above our 2% to 3% kind of expectations. We will see what 2019 has but we don't really see any major changes going in the payer environment. So maybe but somehow we can continue those trends going forward. But just in terms of our planning, we would plan in that 2% to 3% range. And then hopefully with the continued growth of equity, good payer mix, we can be on the top side if not exceed that.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
MatthewBorsch: Maybe I could just pickup on the thread you were just talking to and ask you about Medicare advantage rate and pricing, which obviously are not necessarily tied directly to the Medicare fees schedule. How are you approaching that as that program is continuing to grow so rapidly?
BillRutherford: So about 38%, 37% of our Medicare book if you will is managed. We've seen that grow pretty steadily over the past several quarters. From a contracting perspective, the rates and terms are really consistent with what the Medicare rates in terms are. So we equalize that. So we've been dealing with growing M&A in most of our market. So we think it will continue to grow. And we don't really see a pricing differential between traditional and the managed book. Generally it is around utilization management is where factors come into the managed care book. So if something that we have and is continue to grow on. So I don't think it's a headwind or tailwind either way for us.
SamHazen: Most of our contracts are paid identically to what a traditional Medicare beneficiary would pay us for the same service. So we move in locked step for the vast majority of our Medicare advantage contract in the same manner is the traditional program does. Is that good?
MatthewBorsch: Well, I though it could. It just get start just one more which is how do you look at the sustainability of the Medicare unit pricing relative to commercial? So, it's sort of, you don't mind, it's kind of related question just because the question out there in the industry is there at some point going to be unwillingness of commercial payer to subsidize Medicare? Do you see that as much as some others in the industry do?
SamHazen: Well, I think that's been an ongoing issue that the commercial book of business tends to subsidize the uninsured. It tends to subsidize the under funding that exist with Medicaid program. And it's somewhat on subsidizes the under funding that exists with Medicare. I mean that's always been a pressure point and always been an issue. I don't see anything necessarily influencing that materially in the intermediate run. And so from that standpoint, we try to make sure our commercial pricing is competitive within the market, and is meeting the needs of our payer, partners just as much as it's meeting our needs. We're successful as Bill alluded to in that roughly 80 plus percent of our contracts for 2019 are already accomplished with consistent pricing terms and consisting network configuration terms and so forth. We're about 60% contracted at a similar trend for 2020 and slightly contracted for 2021. So I understand the discussion, but I just don't see at this particular point time any significant movement in that. What we are trying to do is show to the payers how much value we can add to their organization, to their membership through convenient offerings at different price points. That's why we build out our network to include different price points, whether it's urgent care. Whether it's ambulatory surgery centers and so forth. We're also executing on a very robust clinical agenda which we think is driving value for our payers, eliminating infections by targeting certain difficult conditions and so forth timely. So that we can react to the patient and get them out of the hospital in a timely manner. All of these things are value add that we believe we are offering in addition to competitive pricing. So our approach is let's produce a value proposition for the payers that ultimately accomplishes what their membership wants, what their membership needs and what our payers need. And we think that's a durable model.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
MichaelNewshel: Hi. Is there anything to take away from the fact that the EBITDA guidance range is wider than past years? Is there anything in particular with higher degree of uncertainty? Is it just the base getting bigger and the --
BillRutherford: I think simply it ensures the EBITDA will be getting a lot bigger as we go forward. So we kind of range our midpoint on either side of that and turns out to be $400 million or range that we give.
MichaelNewshel: Got it. And as the guidance assume that Medicaid DSH cut to take effect in October for not delay it again or is it small to fit in the range either way since it's only one quarter?
BillRutherford: Yes. It's pretty small in one quarter. We do anticipate with a new year that we go back to kind of traditional inflationary rates on Medicare. We don't really anticipate any rate increases on the Medicaid book either.
MichaelNewshel: Yes. And then just lastly real quick, in the 2019 guidance can you just confirm how much of incremental Medicare dish payments or in the guidance is it like in the $100 million zone?
BillRutherford: It's closely -- I characterize is about 1% of growth for us, in terms of the year-over-year.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
SarahJames: Thank you. Can you update us on how you're thinking about the equity mix trending in 2019? And how do you think about actively managing that mix? Because it sounded like most of the $3.5 billion capital deployment was earmarked for footprint and capacity, but I'm wondering if part of the strategy is ramping up spending on high equity services and if there are certain service areas where HCA would really like to increase exposure over time?
SamHazen: This is Sam. That's a great question. What I would tell you is that we have been on this journey over the past five or six years to increase the complexity of service offerings within our networks. And in that journey has yielded case-mix index growth, I think, over the last three years or so north of 3% in each of those years. And just to give you an example of that in 2018, our bone marrow transplant volume, we have six programs in the U.S., one in the UK, but our six domestic programs grew their bone marrow transplant program volume by 17%. That growth in my opinion was driven by the fact that we have consistent clinical protocols. We have consistent patient navigation protocols and the outcomes from those are very positive and our price point tends to be better than some of the marquee program that are out there. And so patient care closer to home at a high level is a very powerful model. That's just one example. Our trauma volume in 2018 grew by 7%. Another example of where HCA is taking a programmatic approach to a very high-end community need program and yielding value for the patients, value for the community and we think value for our company. And so those are two examples of how we are doing that. I will tell you that we still have opportunities to add programs. Whether it's deeper capabilities in certain service lines like electrophysiology, where we have opportunities to create a company-wide collaborative in electrophysiology and deeper capabilities in our cardiac programs to in many instances adding more sophisticated service lines. Whether like I said, it's critical care medicine in some instances, all of this allows us to generate a higher revenue per patient on the same fixed cost platform that we otherwise would have had. And the combination of that is a very positive mix of business and it contributes to the margin expansion that Bill alluded to. So we think we have market share opportunities. Our physician strategies are geared toward re-sourcing these programs with physicians capability and so forth. And then we have investments that are geared like I said earlier, to really positioning these programs for success. Whether it's with facility capabilities or clinical technology and so forth. The final thing I would say on our sort of high equity business is that we have a very sophisticated rural outreach capability inside of HCA. Whether it's through telemedicine; whether it's through affiliations with rural hospitals; whether it's through EMS relationships or in some instances actually owning a rural hospital because the channel is so important. We've been able to drive downstream business into our hospital that typically is more acute as one would imagine with the fact that they can't get that type of care in a rural hospital. So our relationships with the rural market has allowed us to grow or market share on that front. And that has contributed I think to the case-mix growth as well. So we see this journey continuing. We do not believe we're in the late stages of it. And as our markets continue to grow which they are, we see opportunities for us to add and at the same time pick up market share in many instances.
Operator: We'll take our next question Matthew Gillmor with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.
MatthewGillmor: Hey, thanks. I wanted to ask about the performance and your expectations for the 2017 and 2018 acquisitions. Those hospitals are obviously a headwind to EBITDA this year. There'll be a tailwind next year. So how do they perform in the quarter and how should we think about the cadence of those hospitals moving to breakeven? Will that be more back half weighted or have they already turned the corner?
BillRutherford: Yes, Matt. This is Bill. Good question. So as we talked about throughout the year we anticipated getting the acquisition to a breakeven or better by the end of the year. And indeed we did that fourth quarter that group was profitable for us. For the full year of 2018 it did create a headwind. We've talked about that roughly $80 million or so. And it's going to provide as I said earlier in my comment about an additional 1% of our EBITDA coming from that growth. So year-over-year there's about a 2% of our growth factor from the 2017 and 2018 acquisition. So we're anticipating nice turn for that group. I think it will continue to ramp and we think most of these will take several years to bring them up to reasonable margin levels for HCA. So we think there's continued growth in those classes even beyond 2018. But part of our growth and as I mentioned earlier almost full 2% is going from the headwind in 2018 to providing some contribution for us in 2019.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
FrankMorgan: Good morning. I noticed in your recent debt offering you up size that deal. So I'm just curious between up sizing that deal announcing another acquisition recently. Do you see --are you seeing more opportunities today in terms of bigger system acquisition opportunities? So just any commentary on that would be appreciated. And then just to go back on the guidance the last question asked, hit on this shortly but in terms of any other special cadence considerations as we think about the annual guidance, obviously, you're going to have 11 months of Mission. You've got the DSH coming but any other when we think about the cadence of over the course there any other considerations that we should be thinking about? Thanks.
BillRutherford: So, Frank, I'll start this and maybe Sam can give you some broader commentary on the acquisition market. So, yes, we were very pleased with the debt offering that we completed a week or two ago. We did up size it from our original because of demand. Obviously that was primarily intended for our Mission financing and so we did a $1.5 billion financing last week very successful and very pleased with that also we have a lot of liquidity. We finished the year with as well. So we've got a lot of flexibility on the balance sheet, markets continue to be receptive to HCA. In terms of the cyclical guidance, there's really nothing specific I would call out on there. Yes, our acquisitions will continue to improve throughout the year, but when you overlay that on HCA broad base, I think you can go with our historical quarterly trends as a good baseline. In terms of the broader acquisition landscape, we did have some press on it, New Hampshire smaller acquisition for this. And I think Sam can give some commentary on the broader kind of acquisition pipeline.
SamHazen: Well, I think if you look at the last 2017, 2018, 2019, clearly the company has made a couple of --a number of acquisitions that we think are going to be good acquisitions for us over the long term. Whether it's adding to existing markets like we did in Houston or creating new market opportunities like Savannah and Mission, both of which are really market makers we believe, they will ultimately be in a position if not already which Mission is to deliver what we call the HCA way in a particular market. So my instincts are that we will see more activity whether or not it's systems that are prepared to go the distance and make a strategic decision like Mission has done, we'll just have to wait and see. My sense is though that there is a need to be a part of something bigger. There's a need to be able to leverage learnings across an organization. There's a need to have diversification and HCA brings all three of those to many different systems. And so we will continue to showcase what we can do inside of this great organization. And we're hopeful that will yield future acquisitions similar to what we think the Mission acquisition is going to do for us. That is a uniquely successful system and we think integrating that into HCA is going to present some unique benchmarking for others to consider as they go through the same kind of deliberations.
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.
ScottFidel: Hi, thanks. Can you give us an update on whether what type of trends you saw in the UK market in the fourth quarter and then what you're assuming in the guidance for 2019 in terms of the ongoing turnaround there?
SamHazen: This is Sam. The UK had a decent quarter compared to maybe the first nine months of the year where they had continued struggles. I think it's important to understand that for HCA the UK division represents less than 1.5% of the company's sort of overall EBITDA. It's a very small component of our organization. We like the market. We think we have a great position. We've made a lot of investments in the past. I won't say we're fully invested, but we're largely invested in the necessary capacity and in the certain programs that we have. We have some contingency plans around what the Brexit dynamic may mean to us in certain areas of our business, and how are we going to respond to that. But we think we're starting to turn the corner and as we look at 2019, we have modest growth built into our plan. And I think that modest growth is going to be driven from the development of a more capable outpatient platform, urgent care platform and really continuation of our cancer service line capability that we think will yield some modest growth for us in 2019. Obviously, if the Brexit occurs, it could modify some of our assumptions there. But we don't see that as a very material issue for us in 2019 as we look at our performance over there.
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
BrianTanquilut: Hey, thank you, good morning. Just a question Sam on the macro front. How are you thinking about uncompensated care for 2019? And then you touched on commercial growth earlier and how that's under pressure broadly speaking. So what are your views there and how do you plan to strategize, to keep gaining sharing and how much opportunity do you think are left to gain in your regions?
SamHazen: Our market share today is only 25%. So I'd like to think we have 75% opportunity. So that's sort of how I fundamentally think about. Obviously, we have really formidable competitors in many different markets. The competitive landscape for HCA is very fragmented because we don't compete against the same system from one market to the other in most instances. So that we think create advantage. I think the consistency of our model, our approach to being the provider system of choice has been a very workable model for us. Our fundamental believe is that the portfolio of market that HCA has is very strong, and that is going to yield growth in overall inpatient demand, as well as outpatient demand. And as we continue to execute on our investment strategy, our program strategy which I spoke of a minute ago, and the continued development of our capabilities, our nursing initiative, our clinical agenda, our efficiency agenda, all of those are responding to our patients in a way that's producing a better outcome for them. And we think that's still has legs and we believe that we can continue to grow the company organically through that model. Yes, there maybe some uninsured pressure here and there. I think like Bill said it, our overall uninsured volumes grew a little bit mid single digits this year. That doesn't put that much pressure on our business. There are some states that are considering how they maybe expand Medicaid, they are not Texas or Florida, and they are smaller state. But nonetheless that could be a positive for us. And then as we continue to focus our efforts around how do we gain share in the commercial segment or how do we gain share in this high equity businesses, we think those approaches can yield a very positive outcome for the company. So we remain focused on that. And I think this focus if you look back is what has allowed us to deliver very consistently over the last five or six years. And given that our market place is tend to move at a pace that's noticeable. And by that mean I am not too fast and what's happening, we can make adjustments as we need to in order to respond and continue I think the growth pattern that the company has had. So overall demand growing. Our position competitively improving. Our capabilities as an organization better. We think the combination of all those should yield a solid result. And that if we can wrap around that programmatically and very selectively, high caliber acquisition opportunities like Mission, we think that's a very powerful model.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Ana Gupte with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.
AnaGupte: Hi, thanks, good morning. Following up on that question and your commentary, congrats on the quarter and the consistency that you are bringing to guidance and EBITDA growth. I was looking to see if you had any thoughts on based on the quarter and the last four quarter, if you will for 2018, does that change in your mind anything on your normalized guidance? I think a year ago you had said 2% to 3% volume growth, no market share gain, 2% to 3% pricing growth, flat margin. Your assets and capabilities as you say, built them out and you continue to your capacity utilization I am assuming is going up. Do you see it skew more towards one or the other more of a trajectory on margin expansion? Will share add to the 3%? And then on markets, you talked about cyclicality. Are you comfortable that if we go into economic downturn as a nation that the markets that fairly defensive, either securely or combination of secular and competitive position on that guidance.
SamHazen: Bill?
BillRutherford: So, let me try and Sam can add in on macros. So you are right we've been in this 2% to 3% volume guide for sometime, 4% to 6% EBITDA guide. We know there could be period where we are on the high end that we are very pleased with the momentum that we've got that we talked about throughout the call. But we know healthcare is cyclical mainly there is just macro issue but we think our continuing capital investments, our continued acquisitions opportunities will still provide growth for the company. Clearly, our optimism into 2019 and hopefully we will continue to be beyond that. So right now we are still in this 2% to 3% kind of volume guide. When we look at demand, market share capital, we think that's a pretty good number. When we look at our long-term CAGR, we land right in the middle of that. Fortunately, we are in the period. We've been on the high side of that. And hopefully that will continue so. We need a few more reporting periods and data points before I think we adjust that. We are very comfortable with our long-term guidance of 4% to 6% now we also recommend we've been on a high end of that for 2018 and 2019. But, again, I think as we think about the building blocks, strength of the core operations between volume and pricing and cost management, the acquisition opportunities, the capital investment programs. I think that will continue to contribute to the growth of HCA for the long run. And I don't think we see any macros that are going to change that in a major way in this short run.
SamHazen: This is Sam. I want to add that. We had in 2018, one of the strongest overall portfolio performances we've seen in the company. We had almost 80% of our hospitals grew their EBITDA year-over-year. 70% of our hospitals grew their admission year-over-year. 65% of our hospitals grew their outpatient surgery year-over-year. This is an incredible portfolio performance. And I think it speaks to again the clarity of our approach in the marketplaces. Our re-sourcing of the agenda and then finally the execution of our team is broad based as I mentioned in my prepared comments. And I think the performance metrics that I just shared with you, which are best overall performance we've seen since 2015 is very remarkable and something we are very proud of.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.
RalphGiacobbe: Good morning, hi. On past calls, you've given us commercial yield or managed care revenue per adjusted admission and CMI as well. Hoping you could do that for the fourth quarter as well. And then just on the payer mix, you maybe can you give us that revenue mix? I know you give us the volume but the total revenue on year-over-year basis as well. Thanks.
SamHazen: Not sure I was clear on that.
BillRutherford: Say that again, Ralph? Yes. You lost me.
RalphGiacobbe: Sure. In previous calls I think you've given commercial yield or managed care revenue per adjusted admission and the CMI as well. So I was hoping we can get that for the fourth quarter and then the payer mix, hoping you can give the revenue piece or the revenue percentages of the payer mix as opposed to just the volume. Thanks.
BillRutherford: Let me just start with that, Ralph, for the quarter, commercial case mix was up 2.1%. Year-to-date were up 3.5%. We had a really strong fourth quarter of 2017. So that was the case mix. On revenue per adjusted admission on year-to-date basis were about 3% after we adjust for some reporting procedures about 2% in the fourth quarter. But that's really a function if you go back and look at fourth quarter 2017; it was extremely strong commercial pricing for us 6.8%. So as we mentioned in my remarks, it's really the commercial we see that being pretty stable. We don't see any major changes going on there, but again good intensity, 3.5% CMI growth in the commercial book on a year-to-date basis.
Operator: And we will take our last question from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
GaryTaylor: Well, thank you. Long time listeners, first time caller. So following on Frank's question, I want to ask just a little bit more about acquisition and CapEx strategy. And specifically, I want to ask Sam. Is your approach different, more aggressive, and less aggressive than Milton's? And could you please include international and physician groups as part of the answer? Thanks.
SamHazen: I wouldn't say I am any different than Milton. But, I mean obviously I have been part of our decision making over the past few years in conjunction with Milton, and it's usually a team analysis that we go through. I think it's just the environment, when the environment is presenting opportunities for us to make sizeable acquisitions, I think some of these are once in a lifetime type opportunities and it's important for the company to consider them, I think very carefully. We have and will continue to pursue outpatient acquisitions. We've recently made a large ambulatory surgery center acquisition in Austin, Texas. We have other markets where we are looking at acquisition of ambulatory surgery centers. Certain urgent care companies and so forth that are complementary to existing networks. I think we will be more domestic than international in our pursuit on acquisitions. Obviously, we will look at other markets outside the US but I think the opportunities for HCA more compelling domestically at this particular point in time than they are internationally. Simply because we can bring more synergies to the system with our capabilities in the state versus buying into macros per se in the international market. But that doesn't mean we won't look and consider and if there is a right opportunity we will pursue it. As it relates to physician practices, yes, we continue to use acquisitions of our physicians group as a way to add to our capabilities. Whether it's with more convenient offerings for our patients or for strategic reasons to support certain service line or facility need. So all of that is there. We don't talk about those in any significant way because they are small individually but they add up to support for our overall network positioning. And they support our overall growth agenda in a way that is productive we believe and it has been something that we've been doing over the past five or six years I think very systematically. So I wouldn't say there is any change in our mindset other than we maybe entering a cycle where we are going to have more opportunities to look at systems that we think are unique opportunity. End of Q&A

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the HCA Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: April, thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call and also those of you listening to the webcast. With me here this morning our Chairman, CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, CFO. Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risk, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future results. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc., excluding losses, gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim cost, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's third quarter earnings release. As you heard the call is being recorded and replay will be available later today. With that, let me turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or the webcast. Before we go into details about the quarter, I'd like to take a few moments to talk about our response to Hurricanes Florence and Michael which have recently affected our facilities and colleagues in the Southeast U.S. On September 14, Hurricane Florence made landfall in South Carolina and on October 10 hurricane Michael made landfall in Panama City, Florida. Immediately before and after the storms, we evacuated several hundred patients to other facilities and without patient harm. Both storms had a devastating effect on the communities we serve in Florida and the Carolina's and where our HCA colleagues live and work. Throughout these events, our colleagues in the affected areas and across the enterprise have supported our emergency operations efforts, our patients and each other. Our robust disaster preparedness plans give us confidence when facing weather disasters like this, but it's the teamwork and patient-centered commitment of our HCA Healthcare colleagues that make those plans work so well. I'm very proud of that teamwork and professionalism. Now let me provide some comments on third quarter results. Overall, we are very pleased with third quarter results. Consistent with recent results, we saw solid volume and rate growth, increased intensity of service and excellent expense management which resulted in solid adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter. This morning, we also favorably revised our earnings guidance ranges to reflect results for the nine months ending September 30 and expectations for the remainder of the year. More on this later in my comments. Revenues in the third quarter totaled $11.451 billion, up 7.1% from the previous year's third quarter. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare Inc. increased 78% to $759 million or $2.15 per diluted share compared to $426 million or $1.15 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. Bill will provide more detail on these items in a moment. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter increased to $2.096 billion an 18% increase over the prior year which included the negative impact from both hurricanes in the third quarter of last year and Texas Medicaid waiver payments. Additionally, our third quarter adjusted EBITDA growth rate was unfavorably impacted by an estimated 310 basis points from the sale of Oklahoma University assets. Year-to-date, through September, our adjusted EBITDA totaled $6.441 billion compared to $5.871 billion in the same period of 2017, an increase of 9.7%. Cash flows from operations were very strong, totaling $1.721 billion up from last year's – $1.008 billion last year. We invested $846 million in capital spending in our existing markets, repurchased 2.5 million of our shares at a cost of $302 million and also paid a dividend of $121 million during the third quarter of 2018. This morning we updated our guidance ranges for 2018. Revenues are now projected to range from $46 billion to $47 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to range from $8.7 billion to $8.9 billion. And diluted earnings per share is now estimated to range from $9.05 to $9.45 per diluted share. In September, we announced my retirement as CEO at year-end and the appointment of Sam Hazen as CEO effective January 1, 2019. So today after approximately 80 HCA quarterly earnings calls, this will be my last as an active participant. Since January 1, 2014, it's been my privilege to be the CEO of this great company. I've had the distinct pleasure of getting to know many of you over my 36 years at HCA. This is a wonderful company with many talented people who are committed to the delivery of high-quality patient care and operational excellence. I am extremely proud of the many accomplishments we've achieved as a team including advancing the company's clinical agenda which focuses on delivery of high-quality patient care and improving patient satisfaction. HCA is well-positioned for the future under Sam's leadership and I remain excited about the company's future. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning everyone. I feel like I should pause there just for a moment, recognize your leadership and the example you've set for all of us. So as Milton mentioned, we are pleased with our results as the company reported a solid third quarter. On an as-reported basis our adjusted EBITDA was $2.096 billion or an 18% increase from our $1.776 billion reported in the third quarter of last year. There are a few items I would like to discuss that impacted the year-over-year comparisons. First is the hurricane impact we experienced in the third quarter of 2017 where both hurricane Harvey and Irma impacted our prior-year results. You will recall we estimated a loss of revenues and additional expenses of approximately $140 million or $0.24 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. During the third quarter of this year hurricane Florence hit the Carolinas. Due to a mandatory evacuation order we had to evacuate all of our patients from our Myrtle Beach Grand Strand Hospital. We estimate that we had an approximately $9 million impact associated with Florence in this quarter. Second, the results for the third quarter of 2017 also included a negative impact to operating results related to the final settlement amounts for the program year ended September 30, 2017 for the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program of approximately $80 million or $0.08 per diluted share. And third, as noted in our release this morning, based on the receipt of updated actuarial information we recorded a reduction to the company's reserves for professional liability risk of $70 million or $0.15 per diluted share in this year's third quarter. Finally, as we have noted in our previous quarters based on its contribution last year we estimate the sale of our Oklahoma facilities had a negative impact of approximately 310 basis points on the growth rate of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Our new facilities, which are primarily those facilities purchased in 2017 and the first nine months of 2018, had a negative adjusted EBITDA of $27 million in the third quarter, which was consistent with a negative EBITDA in the third quarter of 2017. So even when you adjust for these items we are pleased with the performance and adjusted growth we experienced in the quarter. So now let me give you some more detail on the performance of some key operating metrics for the quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2017 starting with volume results by payer class. Same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.9% and 3.5% respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 12.6% on a same facility basis and represented 37.6% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 2.6%, while equivalent admissions increased 0.6%. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 8.8%. These also represented 8.8% of our total admissions compared to 8.3% in the prior-year period. Texas and Florida still represent about 70% of our total uninsured admissions. Managed care admissions increased 2.1% and equivalent admissions increased 4% on a same facility basis, a continuation of solid results. Same facility emergency room visits declined 0.4%. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 21% of our total ER visits compared to 20.2% in the prior-year period. The decline in ER visits was primarily driven in our low-acuity ER visits. Our level one through level three ER visits declined 3.8% but our level four and five visits increased 1.8%. This is very similar to what we saw in the second quarter as well. Also our same facility inpatient admissions through the ER increased approximately 3.3% in the quarter. Intensity of service or acuity increased with our same facility case mix increasing 3.8%. Same facility surgeries increased 3.2%. The same facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.6% and outpatient surgeries increasing 4.2%. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.9% in the quarter, primarily reflecting continued increase in the intensity of services during the quarter. Our hospital-only same facility managed care revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.8% in the quarter. Our same facility total uncompensated care, which includes implicit price concessions, charity care and uninsured discounts, totaled $6.342 billion in the quarter as compared to $5.616 (12:11) billion reported in the prior year. This growth was in line with our volume and pricing results. Now turning to expenses and operating margin. Our as reported adjusted EBITDA margin increased 170 basis points from 16.6% in the third quarter last year to 18.3% on an as reported basis. Some of the improvement on margin can be attributed to loss of revenue and increased costs in the prior-year's third quarter due to hurricanes. The sale of our Oklahoma facilities and our new facilities had an estimated 110 basis points unfavorable impact on our adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter of 2018. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.8% compared to last year's third quarter. This metric benefited from the impact of the prior-year hurricanes. Adjusted for this, the current year increase is in line with recent trends. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues were 46.9% compared to 47.5% in last year's third quarter. On a same facility basis salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue were 43.7% versus 44.8% last year and same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.4% in the quarter. Overall, our labor costs remain relatively stable. Supply expense as a percent of revenue was 16.5% this quarter as compared to 16.6% in last year's third quarter. On a consolidated basis supplies as a percent of revenue declined 10 basis points and same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 3% for the third quarter compared to the prior-year period. Other operating expenses declined 100 basis points from last year's third quarter to 18.4% of revenues. This includes the $70 million reduction in our provision for professional liability risk recorded in the third quarter. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.721 billion for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $1.008 billion in last year's third quarter, which is an increase of almost 71%. Free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations of $1.721 billion, less capital expenditures of $846 million, distributions to non-controlling interests of $130 million and dividends paid to shareholders of $121 million was $624 million in the quarter compared to $164 million in Q3 of 2017. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.382 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.76 times at September 30, 2018, compared to 4.02 times at the end of 2017. Now moving to earnings per share, our diluted earnings per share in the quarter totaled $2.15, up from $1.15 in the third quarter of last year. Our EPS was impacted by the items I've previously discussed, as well as a $0.37 per diluted share tax benefit related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Also, we estimate our divestiture of OU operations, coupled with the impact of our new facilities had an approximately $0.10 negative impact on EPS in the quarter as compared to the prior year. So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our volume performance for the quarter as compared to the third quarter of last year. In general, our volume growth in the quarter was consistent with the prior two quarters growth. Additionally, we continued to demonstrate broad-based growth across the company's divisions and across our various service lines. My comments will focus on our same facility, domestic operations. 12 of 14 divisions had growth in both admissions and adjusted admissions. 5 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 11%, while hospital-based emergency room visits declined 1.8%. Once again, higher acuity visits grew while lower acuity visits declined. Admissions through the emergency room, as Bill indicated, grew by 3.3%. Trauma and EMS volumes grew by 4.9% and 1.5% respectively, reflecting the higher acuity visits we are seeing in our emergency rooms. In-patient surgeries were up 1.8%. Surgical admissions were 27.3% of total admissions in the quarter generally consistent with the prior year. Surgical volumes continued to be strong in cardiovascular vascular and orthopedic service lines. 11 of 14 divisions had growth in in-patient surgeries. Outpatient surgery showed strong growth. Hospital-based surgeries were up 5%. And our freestanding ambulatory surgery centers were up 3.8%. 13 of 14 divisions had growth in outpatient surgeries. Behavioral health admissions grew 2.4%. Rehab admissions grew 8.3%. Cardiology procedure volumes, both inpatient and outpatient combined, were up 2.3%, driven mostly by growth in electrophysiology services. Births were down 1.2% and neonatal admissions were down 1.6%. Urgent care visits for the company were down 2.8% on a same facilities basis. They were up however, 12% on a consolidated basis reflecting the growth in the number of overall centers. HCA has now grown same-facility admissions in 18 consecutive quarters. Before I finish my comments, I want to take this time to acknowledge Milton and thank him for his outstanding leadership and for being a great colleague. With almost 37 years of service with the company, Milton has had a tremendous career. On behalf of the senior team and the Board of Directors, we wish him the best upon his retirement at the end of the year. Also I want to share a few thoughts I shared with our board about the company's current state and my view on the company's near-term future. I believe this consistent pattern of growth that HCA demonstrates is a result of multiple factors. First, macro trends at our markets are mostly positive, demand growth is solid and trending favorably, pricing trends remain stable and we believe we have good visibility into them over the next few years, and the competitive environment remains fragmented, which creates an advantage for us given our scale and diversification. Second, the company's growth agenda underneath these macro trends is once again yielding solid market share gains. Our overall competitive position and our diversified portfolio of markets is strong, as a result of improvements in quality outcomes, improvements in nursing performance and strategic capital spending which is adding appropriate inpatient and surgical capacity along with more outpatient facilities to serve our patients conveniently. And third, HCA is fortunate to have a deep and experienced management team that is fully engaged and relentlessly focused on execution and delivering results that create value for our patients, our employees, our physicians and our shareholders. I believe these three factors will continue to support our business in 2019. Typically, we do not provide any indication into the upcoming year at this point. But with the transition in leadership, I felt it important to give a glimpse into the upcoming year. While we can never predict with certainty how our business will perform, the environment in 2019 appears positive in general across our markets. And specifically with respect (20:33-20:42). Our planning process for 2019 is not finished. As usual, we will provide you more details in January when we formally issue guidance for the year. An early look however at 2019 indicates that we expect solid volume growth again and an adjusted EBITDA growth rate somewhere within a reasonable range of this year's currently expected full year growth rate. As we always do at HCA, we will challenge ourselves to find opportunities to enhance performance. I have been with HCA for 36 years and it is truly an honor to be the next CEO. HCA is a great company and I look forward to working with our employees and physicians as we strive to achieve our mission which is fundamentally to give our patients the care they deserve. With that let, me turn the call over to Vic for questions.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Sam, and everyone. With that April, if you will open the queue for questions. And I do encourage each of you to limit your questions to one because I think we have several in the queue.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks. Good morning. First, let me just first say goodbye to Milton. It's been a good run, and Sam, congratulations on the new role, well-deserved. And thank you very much for providing that 2019 viewpoint. I know everyone appreciates it. So that's, my question is going to be around that. Specifically, Sam, you said growth for 2019 should be in the range of 2018. 2018, obviously, had a lot of moving parts in terms of good guys and bad guys, but the reported number looks like about 7%. So I just want to confirm that that's what your – that's the number we should kind of focus on there for expected growth year-over-year in EBITDA?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, Justin this is Bill. Our midpoint of our guidance, you're right would suggest just under a 7% as reported year-over-year growth.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And your – that's – there's no other moving parts we should kind of expect a range, kind of midpoint of a range, for next year could be about that 7%? Is that what you're (23:14) implying?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I don't want to give percentage, we obviously – yeah, I don't want to give specific percentages on there. As we look at the factors, we look at the trends around the core growth, we look at – capital continue to come online. We look at the turn of the trend on acquisitions and all of those together, believe that we should be within a reasonable range of this year's growth rate.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And if I could just follow-up with the – for Q4, your implied guidance seems to have a core growth rate in the 3.5% range. So I'm curious if there are any moving parts I should be thinking about there, maybe there's hurricane weakness in that Q4 given the hurricanes down South or any other kind of moving parts, obviously, it seems like there's a little bit of a difference between 3.5% and 7% for next year.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. So let me call out a couple points when you're looking at our guidance and then what the expected range of growth for this year's fourth quarter is. First, just remind everybody, the fourth quarter of 2017 was an extremely strong quarter for us. We posted a little north of 7% growth over the prior year in that quarter. Second, when we look at the sequential Q3 to Q4 growth, our estimate would be similar, somewhat exceed what we typically see. We've studied the seasonality and we've factored that into our guidance. Third, as you mention, we do have some uncertainty regarding the Q4 impact of Hurricane Michael on our Florida Panhandle operations. We tried to factor a reasonable estimate into that for the quarter into our guidance. And finally, when I really look at our updated guidance as you see at the midpoint we've increased approximately $50 million at the midpoint. It's basically accounting for the professional liability pickup we had this quarter offset by some impact of Michael in the quarter as well. So that's really the factors that went into our overall guidance for the balance of the year.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: All right, thanks for all the questions.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, thank you, Justin.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Yes.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: And, Milton's really not going away.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I am.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I was going to say one thing on 2019 guidance just to be clarified too, it does not include acquisitions such as Mission. That is not included in the range that Sam stated, just to make that clear as well.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thanks again.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning, and congratulations, Milton, and best wishes. I guess, to follow-up on that capital deployment and acquisition question. I'm just curious, is there anything that we should expect to be different with regard to just the cadence of capital deployment that might affect sort of how your volume growth plays out over the next year? And then on the topic of Mission Health any thoughts around you specifically would fund that transaction? Thanks.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. Frank I'll start with the latter. We're still in the process with the Mission Health acquisition. Likely that would be a public market event, but we'll evaluate that just as we get closer and have visibility of a close date. Regarding capital next year and impact, obviously we'll talk about that further when we give, when we complete our planning process and give full year 2019 guidance with specifics. The capital will be a factor that will help contribute the growth trajectory of the company.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yes, this is Sam, Frank. I mean we have about $4.5 billion to $5 billion of capital in our pipeline. We will have a little bit more come online in 2019 than we had in 2018. It comes online at different points in the year, so it will have different impacts if you will on our volume. But I don't think it's going to materially change our volume trends or expectations as we finish up this year and go into next year. We are seeing improving demand in our markets as I mentioned in our call, I mean in my comments rather, and we've seen that now for roughly three or four straight quarters. So we are encouraged by that. And then as I mention, we are starting to see market share gains again which is encouraging with what we're doing in the marketplaces around our growth agenda.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, thank you Frank.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks guys. And congratulations to both on the transition in management. My question is regarding the, is HCA entering into a new phase of your growth? You talked about, I know you talked about the 7%-ish growth in EBITDA for next year as being next year, but your long-term guidance of 4% to 6% that's above that and then we start looking at acquisitions and you're starting to see some acquisitions outside your markets of significant hospital systems, whether it be Savannah or Ashville. So are we approaching a new phase of growth for you guys in terms of new markets?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: This is Sam. I think Ashville and Savannah uniquely offered up opportunities for the company that met our criteria. Both of those systems are fundamentally market-makers in the sense that they can execute on their own what we believe to be the right provider system strategy. So we're still going to remain selective around those criteria that we use to determine whether or not an acquisition fits our model. I would hope that we would see continued opportunities for new markets. Obviously, our interest is primarily inside of our existing portfolio, but to the extent we see a new market that presents a system that has the wherewithal to go the distance if you will, we would be very interested in that. Now obviously those systems come up when they come up. We can't really forecast that, but we will continue to be opportunistic around those situations when they present themselves.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Pete, thank you.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Is there some change that's causing that, them to show up now as opposed to over the last decade?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well the story around Savannah and Mission are totally different. Savannah was in a desperate situation, needed more capital, needed professional management and so forth. Mission, conversely is a very successful system, well manage, great physicians, great financial results and so forth. They just viewed the need for scale as being very significant at least in their thinking and their board made a decision to go down that path with us. So it just depends on the circumstances. Obviously, we believe Savannah has incredible long-term potential and the size of that healthcare market is about one million people when you consider the rural market, which is very similar to the Ashville market in the Western North Carolina rural markets combined. So those kind of situations are really dependent upon the individual circumstances and the strategic analysis that each of the board's take. So I don't know, if there's anything today that's materially different that would suggest there's going to be more, but we'll just have to wait and see how that goes. I think the company is poised to take on more both from a balance sheet standpoint as well as an organizational capacity standpoint. And we think over time these are going to be very productive healthcare systems for the company. Thank you.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Pete.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good morning. And congrats to both of you guys. Bill, just a couple quick questions for you. As I think about the DNA accrual for the quarter it ticked up year-over-year and sequentially, anything to call out there? And then just back to the question on funding for Mission. Are you thinking of using unsecured notes on that one? And also what are your thoughts on investment grade? Thanks.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. On the depreciation that growth is really just factor of our same store as well as new acquisitions that are fueling that and pretty much in line with what we anticipated on there. Relative to Mission financing and the specific metrics, too early to call, we'll evaluate that at the time, what the market conditions are, and we'll look at. In terms of our pursuit of investment grade, we haven't stated that as a specific financial goal but I think as we continue to demonstrate consistent performance, strong balance sheet, great cash flow that hopefully over time we'll be recognized for those trends.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: All right. Thank you.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thanks, Brian.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: And, we'll take our next question from Michael Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks. Since the last call the Medicare IPPS rules finalized for fiscal 2019. So, could you just quantify how much better you think that will be for you than the recent trend and whether there was an incremental Medicare reimbursement factored into the guidance for this calendar year for fourth quarter?
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Bill, are you going to take that?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, I'll cover that. Thanks for the question. So we are getting a favorable update as we assess it now our update will range between 2.5% to 2.8% growth in our Medicare update. That is compared to approximately 1% we received in recent past. So that's an incremental 1.5% to 1.8% on the Medicare update. We believe we have accommodated for this within the context of our overall guidance range and perhaps will be a factor for us as we look towards 2019 as well.
Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC: All right. Thank you.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: We'll take our next question from A.J. Rice from Crédit Suisse. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Congratulations to Sam and Milton. Wish you the best. I was looking, back of the envelope, looks like the stock is up almost three times since you were named Chairman so that's quite a run in five years, so congratulations on that. I guess my question would be a lot of the improvement in margin this quarter and the last few quarters has been driven by the top line performance, strong volumes, strong pricing. I wonder if you guys could spend a minute just talking about what's happening on the individual expense line. I know there was a little of that in the prepared remarks. But is there any area where you're seeing the expenses, whether it's labor supplies, other, in and of themselves opportunities for improvement or any place where you're facing a headwind on the cost side?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: A.J., this is Sam. We are very pleased with the performance of the company operationally over the past year or so. Our teams have stepped up, especially on the human resources side of the equation and had a dramatic impact on our nursing performance. Our nursing contract labor on a year-over-year basis is down significantly. We've been able to increase our hiring as a result of our nursing agenda and human resources agenda. So at this particular point in time on the labor front, we're not anticipating any unusual headwinds as we turn the calendar into 2019. We will continue to execute on the core elements of what we're trying to get done with being a very productive employer and at the same time a great employer for our employees and we think that's going to yield some dividends as we move forward. Obviously, it's important that we grow our volume simply because we get the operating leverage from that growth given the fixed cost structure of the company. On the other two categories, I would say that the trends are generally consistent. We're not seeing anything unusual at this particular point in time on either the supply line item or the other operating expenses. We have been able to manage our physician costs effectively in this particular quarter. I think our physician costs as a percent of revenue were consistent with the previous years. So we haven't seen any dramatic shift there as well. So as we turn into 2019 again, we'll have to get through all the details of our planning over the next 60 days or so but we're not anticipating any material swing in any of the cost trends.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. A.J., thank you very much.
A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And, we'll move on to our next question from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.
Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just quickly wanted to go back. Mission, are you willing to give us an EBITDA run rate? I think we had thought about sort of $130 million to $140 million, I don't know if you want to sort of comment on sort the baseline there? And then my question was really on, you called out hospital-only, same facility revenue per adjusted admission of the 4.8% within managed-care. Is there a reason you make the distinction of hospital only? And then, if I take that percentage in the adjusted admission number that you had provided, the 4%, it would suggest managed-care revenue up close to 9%. It seems like a pretty hefty number, maybe just some commentary on kind of factors driving that aside from just the easier comp. Thanks.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, yeah. Let me start with that. We give the hospital-only managed care just as you look at the consolidated number gets affected by physician practice, urgent care, and other. So, we just tried to provide some clarity on there. We remain pleased with managed-care number; there is clearly an intensity driver of that as well as pricing factor of that. We're pleased with our contracting efforts. We've got good visibility into 2019 and 2020 as well pretty consistent terms and condition that we have experienced. There are potentially, when you look at the quarter-over-quarter results, some hurricane impact as a result as you had recovery of some hospital-based outpatient surgeries this year as well. So, again, overall pleased. That 4.8% is pretty consistent on that stat with what we've seen year-to-date running about the same number. So it's been pretty stable trends for us on that managed-care book.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: And did you want comment on the Mission run rate at this point in time or not?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. I think honestly, it's too early for us to give some commentary on that. As we get into our 2019 guidance and we get closer visibility into that transaction, we'll give you guidance on what we expect the contribution of Mission will be.
Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good. Okay.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Ralph.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. My question I guess is somewhat similar to one that was just asked, but just to kind of stick with that topic a little bit, I mean, the strength in same-store revenue per admission, it definitely seems to be a common theme really within the overall hospital industry this quarter. You got some nice reacceleration as well. But just curious if you could remind us again how much that's driven by raw pricing benefits or perhaps some acceleration of the mix to, a mix shift to greater acuity in the in-patient setting which has really been talked about a lot about this year. Just want to get more color on that last part in particular. Thanks.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Bill you want that one?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, there is clearly an intensity driver of that as we continue to focus our strategic efforts of growing our high intensity business. That's driving that statistic as well. It's why we give you our case mix number, we've seen that grow, pretty consistent in the three to four, sometimes north of that over the past several quarters. And that's really just a function I think of our strategies and new capital and focus on program development is the main driver of that. And as we've seen continue growing demand in the market too, all of those are driving higher in-patient growth that's fueling that revenue per adjusted admission number as well.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: And then just to give you some color. This is Sam again. I mentioned in my prepared comments that our trauma volumes were up four-plus-percent. Just to give you another example, bone marrow transplants inside of HCA in the quarter were up 16%. Our orthopedic surgical volumes, which carry a higher revenue per case than average, were up significantly. Cardiovascular services also carrying a higher revenue per case. Those are contributing factors to this. I think when you look fundamentally at the pricing component of our business we're achieving what we thought we would both on the commercial side as well as the governmental side. And then as you look at the strategic agenda of the company which is to create more clinical capabilities, those additional clinical capabilities allow us to take care of more acute patients, provide more complex procedures and that drives our revenue up. Again that's a very powerful model for us, because it's on the same platform of fixed cost. And if we can increase the acuity in our facilities, deliver the higher revenue per patient, put that on top of the same fixed cost that produces decent margin lift for the company. So that's been our strategy. We continue to execute on it. We think we have headroom in it. As we build out our outpatient facilities in each of our markets we think that opens up the gateway if you will to an HCA provider system. And then when our patients need more complex care we can provide it to them somewhere else in the system. That's fundamentally what we've been about for the past five or six years and we continue to believe that's adding value to the company.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, thanks, Steve.
Steven J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful color. Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead. Josh please go ahead.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Josh you're there? All right. Let's move on.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats Milt. Congrats Sam. Look the question is about the managed care payer mix which continues as you state to show improvement. And last time I think you talked a little bit about the labor market data by your various markets. Can you give us any market specific color on what's going on? Your surgical volumes are really strong for a generally, seasonally, weak quarter. And then on the ED side, at what point do you think this might turn potentially even inflect into a positive? At what point, even the level three ED visits stop kind of mix shifting to urgent care or freestanding?
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Ana, that was pretty good. You just snuck three questions in. We'll give you a break.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Again, we had broad-based performance across a lot of our markets in the quarter. And I think that's a continuation of what we've seen in the first half of the year. But in particular, we had strong performance in our DFW market. We had strong performance in our Austin Texas market. Our north Florida markets were very strong in the quarter. So, very powerful results across this wonderful portfolio that we have of markets. And it's broad-based. It's not just in admission activities. It's in other categories of our business which is encouraging and again reflects the strength of HCA's portfolio not only from a market standpoint, but from a service line standpoint given that we provide so many different services. As it relates to the emergency room, we have seen growth for the year. It's modest. I mean we're up about 1% for the year. Clearly we benefited earlier in the year from flu activity. We have seen somewhat of a slowdown in supply in our markets with respect to freestanding emergency rooms and certain urgent care center development. So maybe over the long-term, we could possibly start to see some rebound in the emergency room volume. Again what we are soft in are the lower revenue elements of our emergency room business. Our higher levels of acuity are producing much more revenue per visit than do the lower levels obviously in how we price. And so the profitability impact of it is not as material as one would think. Nonetheless, we have seen some softness. Some of that could possibly be cannibalized by our own urgent care center development which we think is a very strategic element of what we're trying to do in being comprehensive in the offerings of provider system capability and convenience for our patients as well as having different price points if you will for our payer partners. And so from that standpoint, we may be cannibalizing a little bit of our own business. But long term, we think it's strategic to building out the provider capabilities that we think are necessary for us to be responsive to the marketplace.
Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Super helpful, thank you.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you Ana.
Operator: We'll move to our next question from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I think he must have gotten cut off cause Josh is more verbal than this. All right, anyone else in there?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Go to the next one.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Next question
Operator: We'll move on to Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great, thanks. Just wanted to go back to the Q4 guidance commentary because it's still, trying to square that one out, I guess the last quarter I think you said that the guidance did not include DISH (45:16) which we were kind of estimating was going to be like a $50 million or $60 million boost. So I would've thought that the guidance would have raised by at least that much but then to your point about the liability adjustment minus the hurricane. So why isn't the guidance raised more like $100 million than the $50 million number?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yes, Kevin. This is Bill. I think your number is a little higher when we equate it to the percentage growth than, I don't think we're seeing that $50 million to $60 million, it's probably more in the $35 million to $40 million level for us. And I do think that as you look at our range of guidance that it could potentially put us on a higher to the midpoint. So I think the range is wide enough to accommodate for that Medicare update.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. So you kind of feel like that could get you to the higher end of the range?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Potentially, obviously, we got a lot of revenue. There's a lot of pluses and minuses that flow through in any given time. But again, I think, we feel comfortable with where our guidance is today given all the factors that we're looking at.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I think the business dynamics, we're not anticipating any dynamic change as we go from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. I mean, it's – some of this is we think encouraging with respect to how our volumes have sustained themselves over the year. So we're optimistic that the trends of the company will continue on into the fourth quarter and into 2019 like we mention. So there is a lot of moving parts in our business and, but nonetheless, the key elements are pretty consistent with how we've been operating.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. So basically this is an in line quarter for you guys, an in line guidance. The only changes were some of these outside of the core performance metrics?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I think that's right, Kevin. Yeah.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I think that's fair. All right. Any other questions remaining?
Operator: 
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. April, I think we're good. And I thank everyone for dialing in and look forward to talking to you (47:27). Thank you very much. Thanks April.
Operator: This concludes today's presentation. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the HCA second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Please note that this call is being recorded. And at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Kathy. Good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I'd like to welcome all of you on today's call, including those of you listening to the webcast. With me here this morning are Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO and Executive Vice President. Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, excluding losses, gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's second quarter earnings release. A replay of this call will become available later today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call and the webcast. We were very pleased with the second quarter's results. Revenue growth driven by solid volume and rate growth combined with good expense management provided strong adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter of a solid adjusted EBITDA growth for the company. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2017, we have reported adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.1%, 5.6% and 6.6% on a quarterly basis. In our earnings release this morning, we announced revised earnings guidance, reflecting higher earnings expectations for full year 2018, more on this later in my comments. Revenues in the second quarter totaled $11.529 billion, up 7.4% from the previous year's second quarter. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $820 million or $2.31 per diluted share compared to $657 million or $1.75 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare increased 24.9% and diluted earnings per share increased 32% compared to the previous year's second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $2.227 billion, an increase of 6.6% from the previous year's $2.09 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA growth rate was unfavorably impacted 4.4% by the sale of the Oklahoma University assets in Q1 and the results of recent hospital acquisitions. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA totaled $4.345 billion compared to $4.095 billion, an increase of 6.1%. Volume trends were solid for the second quarter with our reported admissions increasing 4.5% and equivalent admissions increasing 5.1% over the prior year period. Same-facility admissions increased 2.7%, while same-facility equivalent admissions increased 2.8% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2017. I was particularly pleased to see our same-facility managed care and exchange adjusted admissions increase 1.9% in the second quarter. The highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2016. Cash flows from operations remain strong at $1.582 billion compared to $1.404 billion last year. We maintained a balanced approach to investing and capital expenditures in our existing markets, while returning value to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends. We invested $880 million in capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2018, repurchased 4.7 million shares at a cost of $470 million, and also paid a dividend of $122 million during the quarter. During the first six months of 2018, the company has placed in service approximately $625 million in growth capital, adding access points and new capacity to our networks. Estimated growth capital coming online for the remainder of 2018 is approximately $825 million. Capital expenditure investment is a key component of our strategy and we believe it will provide continued opportunities for growth in our markets. This morning, we updated the company's 2018 earnings guidance to reflect the strong performance of the company through June 30, 2018. We increased our estimated revenues, adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share ranges for the year. Revenues are now projected to range from $45.5 billion to $46.5 billion, adjusted EBITDA is estimated to range from $8.65 billion to $8.85 billion and diluted earnings per share is now estimated to range from $9 to $9.40 per diluted share. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I want to take a moment to mention our company's 50th anniversary, which we'll officially celebrate next month. Since our incorporation in August of 1968, HCA Healthcare has grown from a single hospital, Park View Hospital located in Nashville, to what it is today, a healthcare company with close to 2,000 sites of care, 38,000 active physicians, approximately 250,000 employees, more than 28 million annual patient encounters and an enterprise valuation in excess of $70 billion. I'm not sure of our founders, Dr. Frist, Sr., Dr. Frist, Jr., and Jack Massey could have anticipated the impact of the company they launched with that one hospital 50 years ago. We thank them for their original vision and a legacy of commitment to the practice and delivery of healthcare. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill for more information on the quarter.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. Let me give you some more detail on our performance and the results for the quarter, starting with volume results by payer class. During the second quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.6% and 4.2%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 11% on a same-facility basis and represented 37% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions increased 1.6%, while equivalent admissions declined 0.3% in the quarter. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 7.8% in the quarter, while equivalent admissions increased 6.5%. These represented 8% of our total admissions compared to 7.6% in the prior year period. Texas and Florida represented about 70% of our total uninsured admissions. Managed care and exchange admissions increased 0.9% and equivalent admissions increased 1.9% on a same-facility basis in the second quarter compared to the prior year period. Both are an increase from our recent results. Same-facility emergency room visits declined 0.8% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 19.9% of our total ER visits in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 19.3% in the prior year period. Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same-facility case mix increasing 4.1% compared to the prior year period. Same-facility surgeries increased 2.3% in the quarter with same-facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.7% and outpatient surgeries increasing 2.6% from the prior year period. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.6% in the quarter, which reflects continued increase in the intensity of services during the quarter. Our hospital-only same-facility managed care and exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.5% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, same-facility hospital-only managed care and exchange revenue per equivalent admission has increased 5%. Our same-facility total uncompensated care, which includes implicit price concessions, charity care and uninsured discounts, totaled $6.057 billion in the quarter as compared to $5.397 billion reported in the prior year. This growth is in line with our volume and pricing results. So let me take a minute to discuss the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Our as reported adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.6% in the quarter was negatively impacted by our acquisitions and divestitures. We closed on the divestiture of our Oklahoma facilities on February 1 of this year. This negatively impacted our adjusted EBITDA growth rate by approximately 210 basis points in the quarter compared to the prior year. In addition, the impact of our new facilities, which primarily consist of our hospital acquisitions that occurred in 2017 and the first half of 2018, negatively impacted our adjusted EBITDA growth rate by approximately 230 basis points in the quarter. Now turning to expenses and operating margins. Our as reported EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points from 19.5% in the second quarter last year to 19.3% on an as reported basis. The sale of our Oklahoma facilities and our new facilities, which primarily consist of recent acquisitions, had 130 basis points unfavorable impact on our EBITDA margin for the second quarter of 2018. Our same-facility EBITDA margins increased approximately 90 basis points over the prior year. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.3% compared to last year's second quarter. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues were 45.8% compared to 45.6% in last year's second quarter. On a same-facility basis, salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue were 42.4% versus 42.9% last year and same-facility salaries per equivalent admissions increased 2.3% in the quarter. Overall, our labor costs remain relatively stable. Supply expense as a percent of revenue was 16.6% this quarter compared to 16.7% in last year's second quarter on a consolidated basis. On a same-facility basis, supplies as a percent of revenue declined 20 basis points and same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 2.4% for the second quarter compared to the prior year period. Other operating expenses increased 10 basis points from last year's second quarter to 18.4% of revenues. On a same-facility basis, other operating expenses as a percent of revenue declined 20 basis points from the prior year and increased 2% on a per equivalent basis. So let me touch briefly on cash flow. Cash flow from operations increased 12.7% in the quarter to $1.582 billion compared to $1.404 billion in last year's second quarter. Free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations of $1.582 billion, less capital expenditures of $880 million, distributions to non-controlling interest of $93 billion (sic) [$93 million] and dividends paid to shareholders of $122 million was $487 million in the quarter compared to $568 million in Q2 of 2017. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.842 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.91 times at June 30, 2018 compared to 4.02 times at the end of 2017. Moving on to earnings per share, our earnings per share increased 32% in the quarter to $2.31, up from $1.75 in the second quarter of last year. As mentioned in our release, earnings per share was favorably impacted in the quarter by $0.34 due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Also, we estimate our divestiture of our Oklahoma facilities, coupled with the impact of our new facilities, had approximately $0.18 negative impact on earnings per share in the quarter as compared to the prior year. So, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Good morning to everybody. I'm going to provide more detail on our volume performance for the quarter as compared to the second quarter of last year. In general, our volume growth accelerated in the quarter and was broad-based across the company's divisions. My comments will focus on our same-facility's domestic operations. 12 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions. Growth was especially strong in six divisions: North Texas, Gulf Coast, North Florida, San Antonio, Central Texas and South Atlantic divisions. Our East Florida and Mountain divisions conversely were down. 12 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions, five divisions had growth in emergency room visits, freestanding emergency room visits grew 14%, while hospital-based emergency room visits declined 2.5%. Once again, higher acuity visits grew, while lower acuity visits declined. Medicaid emergency room visits were down 4.8%, which explain the overall decline in emergency room visits. Admissions through emergency room grew by 3.4%. Trauma and EMS volumes grew by 3.3% and 0.7%, respectively. Inpatient surgeries were up 2%. Surgical admissions were 27.5% of total admissions in the quarter, which is generally consistent with the prior year. Surgical volumes continue to be strong in cardiovascular, vascular and orthopedic service lines. Eight divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Outpatient surgeries showed strong growth also. Hospital-based surgeries were up 3.5% and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers were up 1.5%. 12 divisions had growth in outpatient surgeries. Behavioral health admissions grew 3%. Rehab admissions grew 7.4%. Cardiology procedure volumes, both inpatient and outpatient combined, were up 2.5%. Births were up 0.4%. Neonatal admissions were down slightly at 0.6%, however, neonatal patient days were up 1.8%, an indication of higher level of acuity in these units. Urgent care visits for the company were down 3.6% on a same-facility basis, but they were up 12% in total. HCA has now grown same-facility admissions in 17 consecutive quarters. We believe this consistent pattern of growth is a result of positive macro factors in our markets and a comprehensive growth agenda that is both well-resourced and well executed. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Sam. All right. Kathy, if you'd like to come back on and poll for questions, please.
Operator: Certainly. We will go first to A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Hi, everyone, and congratulations on the 50th anniversary. I just want to drill down maybe a little bit more on the volumes that you're seeing. I know two or three years ago, the company stepped up the pace of capital spending. I assume that that would be part of the strength you're seeing. Is there any way to delineate that out? And I think, Sam, you mentioned in your comments about the strength in the underlying markets. I know you often talk about being in markets that are growing faster than the overall national average. Is there any way to say has there been in the recent quarters a pickup in the underlying volume trends in your mind, either in your markets or nationally, that's supplementing your growth or is this mostly company specific?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: A.J., thank you. And Sam, do you, well, want to take that to start?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, let me give a little backdrop here first. If you look at 2017, we indicated throughout the year that we believe that the markets that we were in had strong fundamentals and they would ultimately show themselves. They don't show themselves in every year consecutively, as we've mentioned, but nonetheless, they do show themselves. And what we saw in 2017 was moderate demand growth in the first three quarters of the year across all of HCA's markets. But in the fourth quarter, we started to see some elevation in overall demand growth within our markets. It stepped up to almost 1.8%. We don't have the first quarter of 2018, nor the second quarter yet, but it is our belief that the fundamentals within our market are, in fact, strong, as we've mentioned, historically. We think as we look forward that the demand growth is somewhere between 2% and 2.5% across HCA's markets over the next intermediate run. Having said that, we do think our strategies, our capital deployment, our physician engagement and other components of our growth strategy are showing themselves very competitively in the marketplace. And that's part of what we see as contributing to our growth. The capital that we have deployed has come online, and in the individual facilities, most of them are performing as we expected with the new capital. I don't know that it's enough yet to fully indicate that that's what's driving our lift, but I think it is a contributing factor, A.J. And it's just hard for me to sit here and quantify it specifically and say that's driving X amount of growth. But I think, overall, when you look across the different components that we just mentioned, we had pretty much every service line indicator show positive growth, except for the emergency room visits, and that was down slightly. Again, it was down in the categories of our business that are the least profitable, our low acuity business and our Medicaid business. So it didn't have an effect, really, on our revenue stream, nor our profitability. But we remain optimistic about our markets and the macro factors, as I indicated. And then, we believe we're doing the right thing to build out our provider system capabilities, improve our service offerings, improve our quality and engagement with our constituents. And we think it's yielding a pretty positive result for the company.
A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. A.J., maybe just to add, again, on macro, I guess, viewpoint here. Last Friday, the Department of Labor released their annual survey, and it was interesting. We've been saying as a company looking – and especially with our markets, that we're seeing a growth in the number of lives covered by employer-sponsored insurance. And we believe that that macro sooner or later will start to show up in our numbers. And I said we had the highest managed care exchange volumes this quarter that we've seen since really going back to 2016. But interesting in this survey, again, and this is national information, unemployment rates fell in June to 4%, its lowest rate I think in 18 years. And in our markets, our unemployment rates are lower than 4%. Like Nashville, for example, I think the unemployment rate is 2.2%. But more importantly, because of the tighter labor market, this survey indicated that businesses are offering more generous benefits as a result and most importantly for us, more employer-sponsored health insurance. And so we've been seeing that growth in large employers, but what this survey indicated, now even smaller employers, employers with businesses with 50 to 500 workers, are now offering a greater share of their employees than the year before offering health insurance. So, again, these macro trends, I think, are playing well for us, not only this – what I quoted are national statistics, but our markets are performing even better than the national average is. So, again, I think this macro is a favorable indication for us as well.
A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you. Thank you, A.J.
Operator: We will now go to Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets.
Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning. Well, in addition to the strong organic growth, I guess I'll ask about the external growth. I know you've made a number of acquisitions like Savannah, and you have a pending acquisition, Mission Health. Just curious, would like an update on kind of how you see those developing, ones you've already closed, plus the ones that may be pending. And then, any comments on what you might see from a 340B update. I know there's a lot going on out there. Does that have any concerns to you? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Sam, do you want to take the update (24:11) part of that?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: So, let me break our acquisitions down into really three components, Frank. 2017 acquisitions that we did mainly in Texas, and then we have the Savannah acquisition that we did in the first quarter of 2018, and then we're in the due diligence process with Mission, so there's really not a whole lot to report there, other than the fact that we think the diligence process is going well. We continue to be very impressed by the Mission Health System and believe it's a logical acquisition opportunity for HCA, given our strategy and our disciplined approach to acquiring hospitals. Our Texas hospital acquisitions have been a bit of a disappointment, as we've indicated. Over the past six to eight months, we did not accomplish what we thought we would accomplish in the first year. We do believe, however, that we're starting to turn the corner on the operations in those particular facilities and that we believe long-term we made the right decision in adding to our portfolio in Houston. Houston is a large market. We have significant market share and the geographical positioning of these hospitals we believe over the long run will continue to support our network and provide a very reasonable return for the company. Savannah, as we indicated, is a long-term play for us. Savannah, coming out of the gate, is about where we thought it was. We knew it was a struggling institution when we acquired it, but it has really strong fundamentals when it comes to the services that it offers in a very tight CON state like Georgia, the kind of quality physicians and great nursing that it has. It just needs the right leadership, the right resources and the right strategy. And we think over a three to five year period, we're going to be in a really solid position with that particular facility. So, acquisitions continue to play a part of our network development. We've added some outpatient facilities here and there, some physician clinics, one of which that was sizable in Austin, Texas that supported our network there. So we continue to do these tuck-ins. We have, over the last year, as you know here, added a few hospitals, and we'll continue to look for those as they surface. And as long as they make sense strategically and financially, we will pursue them with the same kind of disciplined approach we had in the past. On the 340B, Vic, you want to do that one?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I'll take that. Thanks. Frank, I think you're aware and most are aware that HCA and investor-owned hospitals are not eligible for 340B funding. So, obviously, there's a lot of talk about 340B and changes to it and what have you, but those really, at this point, we would not see impacting us or the other investor-owned companies.
Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: I guess if they went back and changed something, I know it actually was a benefit in your guidance for Medicare rates, but what I was saying was just any fears if they were to come back and change it, would they come claw back and would it – it might have a negative impact on you, if they were to reverse something?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: That's a fair question. Yes, when they did do the reduction in payments to 340Bs effective January 1, they put those reductions back into the base for all hospitals. And to be perfectly honest, if you look at roughly 3,000 hospitals in this country, there are about 500 hospitals that were part of the 340B program, about 560, that then ended up with a little less in 340B payment. All the rest, including investor-owns and all the other non-profits benefited by that redistribution. So it is there. It's not a huge number, but it is part of our reimbursement. If there was a change and they went back on it, obviously, it would be some impact, but relatively immaterial. And obviously, we're watching that. We don't really see any indication of that happening.
Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thanks, Frank.
Operator: Our next question will come from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks, guys. Good morning. It looks like preliminary Medicare rates for 2019 came in pretty strong, both in terms of the IPPS rate and the change in DSH. Was hoping you could size the potential impact here if these rates are finalized in August. And did you embed anything into the guidance update for Q4 as these things roll on? And then also, wanted to follow up on your comments on acquired facilities. Looks like they've lost about $75 million in EBITDA year-to-date. So, I was just curious in terms of your view of performance built into guidance for the second half. Do you think they lose something similar? And then, do you think you can get to breakeven or even a positive contribution in 2019? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. I'll do the Medicare rate and then I think Bill will talk about the acquisition number. Justin, our position as a company is we really don't discuss that until we see final rules. So we still haven't seen the final inpatient rule, nor have they actually published the proposed outpatient rule, which should be coming shortly. Now having said all of that, the early indications are that our rate increase coming in October 1 of this year would be better than most previous years we've seen for a while, but we're going to hang there until we see final rules before we try to quantify it in any way.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, and Justin, this is Bill. Embedded in our guidance on that is pretty much just our trends continuing on and so we'll wait for the final rule. Relative to the acquisitions, as Sam mentioned, we do anticipate improved performance in our recent acquisitions, but they still will be a year-over-year headwind for us in the back half of the year. In terms of our plans to get them to breakeven by 2019, I think each of them have a little different unique story, as Sam indicated, but I think our plans would be that they should be able to be a growth vehicle for us going forward and be a breakeven or better going forward.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Justin.
Operator: We will now go to Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets.
Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes, good morning. Thank you. Just a question on the – I appreciate all the information that you gave in terms of the backdrop for the higher volumes we're seeing. And I'm not taking anything away, of course, from your own execution, which I'm sure is an integral part of that. But my question is, have you followed or believed in any sort of model that is correlated with the economy? We followed that for a long time and I'll tell you, sort of pointed to a three to five year lag that we didn't see in any dramatic fashion but maybe we are now. I'm just curious what your thoughts are on that.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Milton?
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, obviously, not recently, but a couple of years – few years ago, we did do a study looking at the effect of the economy on healthcare spending and healthcare volumes. And what we found – we did see our study revealed a lag. If my memory's correct, it was probably an 18 to 24 month lag between when an economy started increasing before we started seeing the upside from that. And likewise, when there's a downturn, we tend to have 18 to 24 months of reasonable – of trends (31:56) before we see the impact. So, again, that study we did is somewhat dated, but it did conclude that we should expect a lag between business trends in volumes as far as volumes in our sector and the movement of the economy.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Matt.
Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe of Citigroup.
Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. You strung together several quarters of acuity up over 4%, and I know you said you expect more like 2% to 3%. Any update on thoughts of sort of sustainability around that? And then just a second piece somewhat related to surgery, seemed like a little bit of a turnaround there, one of the better quarters we've seen in a while. Just anything to sort of call out within specific service lines, both inpatient, outpatient? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Ralph. Sam, sounds like yours.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I think on the case mix, if you look back at 2016, we were about 3% – north of 3%. 2017, north of 3%. The first half of 2017, north of 4%. So, we have seen some acceleration in our case mix. Some of that we think is a result of programmatic development in key service lines, whether it's trauma, cardiovascular, deeper capabilities in orthopedics and oncology, all of these things are playing a part, so it's difficult to point to any one of them. Some of our clinical initiatives, I will tell you, are also contributing to case mix growth. As we get better at identifying and supporting certain clinical requirements of our patients, that's also contributing somewhat to the case mix growth. I think fundamentally what you have at some level is the fact that lower acuity business is exiting in many instances to the outpatient environment that's lifting the composite inpatient case mix somewhat as well. We see that in the composition of our patient days when we look at our critical care days as a percent of total or our intermediate level days as a percent of total. So, those things do contribute. On the outpatient surgery and the inpatient surgery, inpatient surgery continues to perform at a pretty good level. I forgot exactly how many quarters in a row we've had inpatient growth activity on the surgical side. We were really pleased with our outpatient surgical growth in the quarter. Again, we think that's a function of our physician recruitment, ambulatory surgery center development, and our OR of Choice initiative, where we're really working to deliver a great experience for our patients and a very efficient and well-equipped experience for our surgeons. So, the combination of all those things are contributing to our trends, I think, and we continue to be optimistic with our surgical agenda. And our investments that Milton alluded to in his comments are also, I think, a part of what's happening. We continue to add capacity, we continue to upgrade the technology inside of our surgical suites, and we're seeing the benefits of that as well.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Milton, anything -
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, just on that – and to Sam's point about surgical growth, I was looking last night and this morning, and just wanted to point this out. If you look at our total surgery cases growth in the second quarter of last year, up 2.3%. That's the highest growth rate the company has reported since the first quarter of 2016. And I'll call out, too, that that was, of course, one extra day in that quarter because of leap year. Inpatient surgery cases, as Sam had mentioned, 1.7% growth this quarter. That's the highest growth rate since the second quarter of 2016. Outpatient surgery cases up 2.6% this quarter. That's the highest growth rate we've reported since the first quarter of 2016. And hospital-based outpatient surgery cases up 3.5% this quarter. That's the highest growth rate we've reported since the first quarter of 2016. So, again – and all of these have been trending with improvement, but again, this solid performance on our surgery cases this quarter. And again, that's obviously impacting the case mix index.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Ralph.
Operator: We will now go to Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Sure. Just to expand on that a little bit – and by the way, happy birthday. I want to understand a little bit more about what we see going on with the managed care mix, relative – second quarter relative to the first quarter. The managed care admits were up 0.9% this quarter, same-facility basis, and up 1% in the first quarter. The equivalent admissions, however, were up 1.9% this quarter and 1.2% in the first quarter. So that seems to have accelerated. And if I look at your outpatient surgeries, that was up 2.6% overall, same-store basis, and that was down 0.5% in the first quarter. So I'm wondering, is there some kind of a rebound that we had from maybe weather in the first quarter and we're seeing some of that in the second quarter here now in the outpatient surgery side, because that could be stuff that might be more likely delayed than maybe in-patient stuff. And so I'm trying to understand, is there any rebound in this or is this all straight growth?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: This is Sam. We did not have any significant weather issues in the first quarter and we're not viewing the second quarter results as a rebound effect from anything unusual in the first quarter. We just – we have, we think, reasonable growth initiatives in this particular category. And obviously, outpatient surgery is roughly 50% to 55% commercial business, so it has an influence on our adjusted admissions, as you indicate. And so that's a very important part of our outpatient commercial strategy, is the surgical side of things, but there's nothing unusual, at least in our analysis of our business trends, in the second quarter.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Peter.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Just one follow up, if you don't mind. What do you think is responsible for...
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Okay, go ahead.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: ... the change from 2.6% versus the down 0.5% in the first quarter?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I'm not sure I can point to that. I think, again, there's so many factors and so many components to each of these categories, it's hard to particularly identify one thing or two things as driving it. For me, when I pull up and I look at our effort at providing great capabilities for our physicians, providing a very efficient and effective environment for our patients, the investments that we're making in technology in our surgical suites, the recruitment of surgeons, all of this adds up. And it doesn't go in a straight line. I wish it did. It would make my life a heck of a lot easier, but it doesn't. And so, we're going to have some ups and downs, if you will, in some of these categories depending on the calendar and so forth. But, for us, we think we have a very robust and comprehensive agenda around growing surgical activities and attracting surgeons and patients to our facilities. And so we're viewing it more as a culmination of the different initiatives we've got.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Perfect. Thank you.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, maybe I'd add one more piece of color to it. I mean, I think, too, that you're comparing the second quarter to the first quarter. If you go back to the fourth quarter, we were up almost just under 1%.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: We've seen (39:45) recent trends in our business where the fourth quarter, especially elective surgery cases, i.e. outpatient surgery cases, tend to increase in the fourth quarter as people may be trying to get in before starting new deductibles and co-pays in the upcoming year. And typically, we do see lower surgical volumes in the first quarter, I think, primarily as a result of people who can't get any things done in the fourth quarter. So I think that the 2.6% we reported compared to the first quarter, I think some of it may be explain somewhat the seasonality. But, two, I think, again, it may reflect more people with confidence in the economy coming back in and into – for healthcare services. Again, that's my speculation. But I do think when you compare it to the first quarter, that's typically a lower volume surgical – outpatient surgical quarter for us.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Peter.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks.
Operator: We will now go to Matthew Gillmore of Baird.
Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. Thanks for the question and congrats on 50 years. I wanted to ask about competition within your markets. HCA's obviously increased CapEx spending the last couple of years in a big way. Can you give us some insight into your local competitors? Have they responded from a CapEx perspective? Are they keeping pace or do you think the spending is creating a greater level of differentiation than prior years?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Sam, the route (41:06)?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: This is Sam again. I think, in general, we think our spending is giving us a competitive advantage. There are specific markets where our competitors are spending at equal levels and it's not necessarily differentiating one institution from the other. Overall, it's our judgment that the competitive positioning of HCA systems across the 42 domestic markets where we do business in the states is better today than it was the same time last year because of the different elements that we judge are necessary for competitive positioning, capital being one of them. Physician satisfaction, patient satisfaction, nursing engagement, all of these components, service line development, the development of our outpatient or ambulatory footprint, all of these pieces go into assessing whether or not we are at a competitive positioning from one market to the other at an appropriate level. And it's our belief that we have incrementally year-over-year improved our competitive positioning in most of our markets. There are some very formidable competitors in HCA's markets and we have to be responsive to some of their movements, just like they respond to ours. And so, again, in general, I think our positioning is better partly due to the capital expenditures, but also partly due to these other components that are very important to overall competitive positioning.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Matthew.
Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll now go to Josh Raskin of Nephron Research.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to dig in a little bit more on the ED, I guess, general weakness. And I'm curious it's just the one area that kind of sticks out, and I don't know, is that competition? Is that urgent care? Is there some cannibalization? Are there payer-related actions that are causing that? And then, I guess the real question on ED is like, is it actually a bad thing economically for you guys, just from an EBITDA perspective, is moving some of this volume out of the sort of high-cost emergency room into perhaps some of your recently built out outpatient facilities? Is that actually EBITDA neutral or even positive for you guys?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Josh, good question. Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I think all of the factors you listed are relevant to the emergency room discussion. There are more competitors, whether it's in the same type of care in emergency room business or in substitutes potentially in urgent care. Some of our investments are potentially cannibalizing some of our business because most of the declines are in the lower – all of the declines, excuse me, are in the lower acuity levels of business. Depending on the payer mix determines the profitability, clearly. Medicaid is not a very significant payer inside of our emergency rooms. As I indicated, our Medicare ER visits, which account for about 30% of our total visits, were down 4.8%. If you nullify that particular payer class, we were actually up in Medicare and commercial combined, and even self-pay, throw that into the mix. So I think from that standpoint, it didn't have any material effect on our profitability. Additionally, as I indicated, our admissions through the ER were in fact up in the quarter, reflecting the higher acuity patients that we're seeing in the emergency room. Obviously, from a capital standpoint, if we lose the lower acuity, it could reduce the need for certain capital commitments down the road. But, right now, I think it's a combination of all those factors you listed. We continue to be very focused on our emergency room. Our emergency room satisfaction has grown and improved significantly over the past few years. Our throughput is remarkable. We see 9 million ER patients a year. The average time to a patient to seeing a clinician is 11 minutes. And so our continued focus on operational throughput, patient satisfaction, and in some instances, growth, will continue to be a very important part of our story. And so we have roughly 5,000 ER beds in HCA. As Milton indicated, we're adding to that because we have quite a bit of utilization. And as we see the marketplace evolve, we'll make some minor adjustments here and there. But we're very focused on having a very good emergency room service line.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Sam. Thanks, Josh.
Operator: We now will take a question from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a question on your views on the ASC side of the business in terms of strategy. Do you see the need to do, say, a large-scale acquisition or make a bigger push to expand ASC business beyond what you're doing today?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Milton.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I mean, again, we're pleased with our ASC operations today. We have been selectively adding to the number of ASCs we operate. We will continue to look for appropriate opportunities to add outpatient services, especially ASCs in our business. I don't feel compelled to have to do a large acquisition which could result in us acquiring ASCs that's not in our core market. So very pleased with our strategy today and don't see a need to have to deviate from it.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: Next question will come from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. I wanted to focus in on the strong behavioral trends. Is HCA experiencing any headwinds such as bed closures related to staffing shortages in your psych assets? And can you talk about the labor market dynamics in psych, whether the environment around nurse shortages and wage pressure is improving or getting more difficult? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Sarah. Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: We have 60 behavioral units in HCA. That's not grown on a year-over-year basis. We had the same number last year through the second quarter. There have been challenges from one facility to the other periodically around the need for psychiatrists. We have evolved a number of tactics to deal with that using telemedicine in some instances, developing graduate medical education programs that support psychiatrist development in a second instance, and so forth. So, that has surfaced periodically. We've tended to be able to overcome those. And that's why we've had, I think, a decent result. There are some challenges in the nursing front with behavioral health nurses. It's an area where we're having to spend some time and energy in trying to create a better environment for our nurses and support our behavioral health patients. But behavioral health continues to be a very important service line for HCA. We have opportunities to invest in it. It complements our emergency room and other approaches to the business. And so we will continue to focus on it as we have in the past, and our growth, we believe, can still be in that low to mid single-digits as it's trended the first half of this year.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Sarah.
Operator: We will now go to Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah, thanks. Yeah, my question was about your normalized growth guidance of 4% to 6% on EBITDA, if I recall it, and on revenue as well, the 2% to 3% volume, 2% to 3% pricing. The business model seems to be working really well right now. Your competitive position's driving share gains. You're seeing pricing growth on acuity and payer mix, potentially also the margin expansion with scale and integration. And your pull through right now looks like on guidance it's above the upper end of guidance. So, when do you think you might feel comfortable raising your growth guidance?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Bill, do you want to -
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, I'll take that and let others add in. You're right, our long-term guidance is 4% to 6%. And we've said, I think, pretty consistently, there's going to be periods where we might be on the high end or above, and there might be periods on the lower end, but over the long run, that 4% to 6% is a good number. And I think as we've all mentioned today, we're very pleased with the results that the company's achieved, the momentum that we have competitively that Sam mentioned. You're right. On a year-to-date basis, we've got strong performance. We're at 6.1% on an as reported basis. When you normalize for our OU operations, we're pushing close to 8% on that number. You look at our full year guidance would reflect about 6.3% at the midpoint of our revised guidance on a year-over-year basis. And when you adjust for the sale of the OU facilities and last year's hurricane impact, puts us probably close to that 6.5% to 6.6%. So we are above that 4% to 6% longer term view. And I think that is reflective of all of these positive trends and market momentums we have. But as I started with, we've always said, there's going to be periods where we're going to be above that, maybe periods on the low end of that. So I don't think we're in a position today to think about revising that long-term numbers, but we're very optimistic about the growth trends of the company.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Bill, thanks. Thanks, Ana.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: And now, we'll go to Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Morning, guys. Thanks for all the color today, and congrats on the anniversary. I guess I just wanted to sort of connect a couple dots here. It sounds like with the ER declines, coupled with really stark improvement in the surgery trends, perhaps you're seeing a pickup in elective procedures. Do you think that's a fair read? And if so, what would that suggest about sort of utilization and where you think we are in the cycle? And then sort of separate but related to that point, any comments on salary, wages and benefits? Is wage pressure, the trend rate there accelerating, or is that pretty stable still?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I think, in general – this is Sam again – the composition of our inpatient business, elective and emergent, is about the same. Slightly more emergent with 3.4% ER admission versus our composite, so just a slight increase on that front. On the outpatient side, clearly, most of that activity is elective, especially in the surgical area. And so that would suggest, at least in this quarter, we did see more elective business. I think back to Milton's point, as you have more and more people employed, more and more people covered by employer-sponsored insurance, you could see more elective activities. We have seen growth in our birth rate or birth volumes. That has obviously more of an elective type of case, if you want to call it that. So that's part of the composition as well. On the labor costs, we're particularly pleased with what's going on with our labor initiatives. I think our overall cost per FTE, when you look at the full composition of salaries, contract labor and benefits, was 2.7% per FTE on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. That's very consistent with the first quarter and with previous quarters in 2017. Our employee engagement as a company improved. Our nursing engagement improved. Our human resources platform, which has been consolidated over the years, is becoming a more effective tool at supporting our facilities in delivering better human resources capability. So we're very pleased with the overall performance of the company on many metrics. Our nursing turnover hit an all-time low. We feel that in some ways we're winning the market share gain on nurses with what we're doing with our nursing initiative. So we're very encouraged by the efforts and the results that our teams are producing with our overall labor agenda.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Steve. And we have time for just one more question.
Operator: And that question will come from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great, thanks. I want to sort of dig into pricing a little bit. I guess you guys showed another strong quarter of pricing this quarter. How do you think about the sustainability of that number? Is that a good number to think about over the intermediate term? And what is driving it to be higher this year versus the past year or so? Is it mix? Is this acuity thing sustainable? Any other color that you have there.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Kevin.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Kevin, I'll try to take that. As you know, Kevin, we had pretty stable pricing for some time. When you look at the commercial pricing, we've talked about, we've got pretty good visibility, and that almost 60% contracted for 2019, and pushing 40% for 2020, and all those at a pretty consistent rate and terms going forward. We've said for some time, we see an overall composite of 2% to 3%. Again, there may be periods we're on the high end of that versus – and some periods on the low end. I think what's driving now is, clearly, the intensity growth going forward. Maybe a little bit of the drop of that lower acuity business is boosting it as well. So I still think the ranges that we've trended in over the long run is a good peg for HCA.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Kevin, thank you. I want to thank all of you for being on the call and look forward to seeing you and talking to you again. Thank you.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We'd like to thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the HCA First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Lynette, thank you, and good morning everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome everyone on today's call; also welcome those of you who are listening to our webcast. With me here this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our Chief Financial Officer.

Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. excluding losses, gains on sales of facility, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's first quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded. A replay will be available later today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Right. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call and the webcast. This morning we issued our first quarter 2018 earnings release, and overall, we are pleased with the results from the first quarter. Revenue growth supported by growth in volume and rate along with good expense management resulted in solid adjusted EBITDA growth in the first quarter of 2018. We were pleased that we're able to close the divestiture of our Oklahoma facilities and the acquisition of Memorial Health in Savannah, Georgia, during the quarter. First quarter results were solid with revenues totaling $11.423 billion, up 7.5% from the previous year's first quarter, and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $1.144 billion or $3.18 per diluted share, which compares to $659 million or $1.74 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. The 2018 quarterly results included gains on sales of facilities of $405 million or $0.85 per diluted share, related primarily to the sale of our Oklahoma facilities. We also recognized a benefit to our tax revision of $92 million or $0.26 per diluted share related to employee equity award settlements, which compares to $67 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the previous year's first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $2.118 billion, up 5.6% from the prior year's $2.005 billion. Adjusted EBITDA growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 310 basis points, related to the sale of the OU assets, and our recent acquisitions. Volume trends were solid in first quarter with our reported admissions and equivalent admissions, each increasing 4.6% over the prior year. Same facility admissions increased 2.2%, and same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.8% in the quarter, compared to the prior year period. While the first quarter 2018 same facility ER visits increased 3.5% compared to the prior year. Cash flows from operations remain strong at $1.3 billion in the quarter. We continued a balanced approach to investing and capital expenditures in our existing markets and repurchasing our shares while also completing select acquisitions. We invested $694 million in capital projects during the first quarter of 2018, repurchased 4.37 million shares at a cost of $423 million and paid a dividend of $123 million during the quarter. Also, during the first quarter, as previously mentioned, we completed the acquisition of Memorial Health in Savannah, Georgia. We're excited to enter this new market in Georgia and believe it will complement our existing operations along the southern Atlantic Coast. We also completed the divestiture of Oklahoma facilities on February 1, 2018 for proceeds of $758 million. As reported, we have signed a non-binding letter of intent to purchase Mission Health based in Asheville, North Carolina. Mission is a system of six hospitals combined with several other sites of care in western North Carolina. We are excited to move forward with our due diligence and exclusive discussions with this outstanding organization. I believe we are well-positioned for growth as we continue to invest capital in large growing markets, execute our growth agenda, and deliver high quality care for our patients. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. Let me give you some more detail on our performance and the results for the quarter. As we reported in the first quarter, our same facility admissions increased 10.2% over the prior year and same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.8%. Our same facility admissions for our United States domestic operations increased by 2.4% over the prior year and adjusted admissions increased by 2%. Sam will provide more color on the drivers of this volume in a moment, but I'll give you some results by payer class. During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.9% and 2.6%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 9.5% on a same facility basis and represent 36.3% for total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions were flat, while equivalent admissions declined 0.8% in the quarter. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 10.1% in the quarter, while equivalent admissions increased 7.3%. These represent 7.4% of our total admissions compared to 6.8% last year. Texas and Florida represent about 70% of our total uninsured admissions. Managed care, other, and exchange admissions increased 1%, and equivalent admissions increased 1.2% on a same facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.5% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 19.1% of our total ER visits in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 18.4% in the prior year. Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 4.4% compared to the prior year period. Same facility surgeries declined 0.2% in the quarter, the same facility inpatient surgeries increasing 0.3% and outpatient surgeries declining 0.5% from the prior year. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.9% in the quarter, primarily reflecting continued increase in the intensity of services during the quarter. Our same facility managed care, other, and exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.8% in the quarter, relatively consistent with recent trends. With the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, we no longer report a provision for doubtful accounts or bad debts as a separate line item. Our previously reported bad debts are now referred to as implicit price concessions. Our total uncompensated care, which includes implicit price concessions, charity care, and uninsured discounts was $6.252 billion in the quarter, as compared to $5.327 billion as reported in the prior year. This reflects growth from uninsured volume, pricing trends, as well as our recent acquisitions. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard had no material impact on the amount or timing of our revenue recognition. Now, turning to expenses and operating margins. Our as reported EBITDA margin declined 40 basis points from 18.9% in the first quarter last year to 18.5% on an as reported basis. Our recent acquisition had an 80 basis points unfavorable impact on EBITDA margins. Our same facility EBITDA margins increased approximately 40 basis points over the prior year. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 3.5% compared to last year's first quarter. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues were 46.3% compared to 46.1% in the last year's first quarter. On a same facility basis, salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue were 43.1% versus 43.2% last year, and same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 3.5% in the quarter. Overall, our labor costs remain relatively stable. Supply expense as a percent of revenue was 16.8% this quarter as compared to 16.9% in the last year's first quarter on a consolidated basis. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 2.7% for the first quarter compared to the prior-year period. Other operating expenses increased 30 basis points from last year's first quarter to 18.5% of revenues. On a same store basis, other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were flat compared to prior year. Let me just discuss briefly the impact of the acquisitions and divestitures. Our as reported adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.6% was negatively impacted by our acquisitions and divestitures. We closed on the divestiture of OU operations on February 1 of this year. This negatively impacted our adjusted EBITDA growth rate by approximately 150 basis points in the quarter. In addition, the impact of our recent acquisitions negatively impacted our adjusted EBITDA growth rate by approximately 160 basis points in the quarter. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.3 billion compared to $1.28 billion last year's Q1. Free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion less capital expenditures of $694 million, distributions to non-controlling interests of $92 million, and dividends paid to shareholders of $123 million, was $391 million in the quarter compared to the $564 million in the first quarter of 2017. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.77 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.99 times at March 31, 2018 compared to 4.02 times at the end of 2017. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.4%, as we benefited from the lower tax rate resulting from tax reform and $92 million or $0.26 per diluted share related to employee equity award settlements. Let me speak for a moment on our earnings per share of $3.18 this quarter compared to the $1.74 per share we recorded in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 results include the $405 million, or $0.85 per share gain on sale of facilities. Excluding this gain, earnings per share grew approximately 34% as compared to the prior year. We attribute approximately $0.20 to the tax reform benefit and an incremental $0.08 due to equity award benefit based on $0.26 this year versus $0.18 in the prior year. Lastly, we estimate our divestiture of our OU operations, coupled with the impact of recent acquisitions, had approximately $0.13 negative impact on EPS in the quarter as compared to the prior year. Let me talk briefly about health insurance exchange. In the first quarter, our same facility health exchange admissions increased 4.4% over prior year and represent approximately 2.5% of our total admissions. Same facility health exchange ER visits increased 6.6% over prior year and represent 2.4% of our total ER visits. So, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, good morning. I'm going to provide more detail on our volume performance for the quarter as compared to the first quarter of last year. My comments will focus on our same facilities domestic operation. In general, we had broad-based growth across most of our divisions and we had broad-based growth across the various service lines. 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions. Growth was especially strong in six divisions: North Texas, North Florida, Capital, San Antonio, Central Texas, and Tennessee divisions. Conversely, our East Florida, Far West and Mountain divisions were down. 11 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions, 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 23% while hospital-based emergency room visits increased 1.2%. Once again, growth was stronger in high-acuity visits, but we did see growth in lower-acuity visits also. Admissions through the emergency room grew by 3.5%. Trauma and EMS volumes grew by 4.4% and 2.8%, respectively. Inpatient surgeries were up 1%. Surgical admissions were 26% of total admissions in the quarter, generally consistent with the prior year. Surgical volumes continue to be strong in cardiovascular and orthopedic service lines, 8 of 14 divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Outpatient surgeries were mostly flat in both our hospital-based and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers, 8 of 14 divisions had growth in outpatient surgeries. Behavioral Health admissions grew 4.2%. Rehab admissions grew 4.8%. Cardiology procedure volumes, both inpatient and outpatient combined, were up 1.3%. Births were up 0.3%, which is the first quarter we have seen growth in two years. Neonatal admissions were down slightly at 0.6%, however, neonatal patient days were up 3.2%, an indication of a higher level of acuity in these units. Urgent care visits for the company were up 14% on a same facility basis and 34% in total. The flu season in the quarter had a positive impact on our admissions and emergency room visits. Approximately 29% of our admission growth was flu related and approximately 50% of our emergency room visits growth was flu related. HCA has now grown same facilities admissions and emergency room visits in 16 consecutive quarters. We believe this consistent pattern of growth is a result of positive macro factors in our markets and a comprehensive growth agenda that is both well-resourced and well executed. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, thank you, Sam. All right, with that, we're ready to take calls, Lynette, or take questions. And please limit yourself to one as we have several on here that probably would like to ask questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take the first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, this is Steve Baxter on for Justin. I was hoping that you could explain sort of the progression of some of the newly acquired facilities that you mentioned as being an EBITDA drag. I guess, could you size for us how much revenue fits in that bucket and how quickly those margins will progress over time and whether getting to company average margins is kind of realistic, given the starting point there?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, Steve, thank you. Bill.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, I'll start and you can add in. So, our new acquisitions contributed about $320 million of revenue in the quarter and principally comprised of our acquisitions in Houston towards the last year and then, as Milt mentioned in his comments, Memorial Savannah is a recent acquisition closed on February 1. Going to Savannah, we knew that was going to take a longer term to bring that up to reasonable margin expectations. I think, in our previous acquisitions in Houston, it's on the chassis of an existing division, so we are optimistic there's going to be continued improvements occurring through the balance of the year and they'll contribute to the long-term growth of the company.
Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC: All right.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: We'll move to the next caller in the queue, Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets.
Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes, thank you. Good morning. I was hoping that you could talk to the impact you think you might get and perhaps the probability that you see of a Medicaid expansion in Virginia.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Matt, I'll go ahead and take that. This is Vic. Touched base with our Virginia folks this morning. I think, they are reasonably optimistic that Medicaid may expand. It likely will have some employment qualifications with it, so it's hard to know the full impact. But we won't know for sure until probably sometime in May as to whether or not it does expand or not.
Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: We'll hear next from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC: Hi. Thanks, good morning. Wanted to follow up on 14% urgent care growth. I think you said that was actually same-store basis. And so, I'm curious if there's targeted approaches, you guys doing something differently in the market around your urgent cares, or maybe some of that just flu this quarter?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I think it's a combination of both. There were clearly flu activity in our urgent care centers. I don't have the specific metric on that. We have continued to add to our overall portfolio of urgent care centers. We're up to a roughly 125, I think, compared to maybe 80 or so last year at this particular point in time, so quite a bit of growth in our overall urgent care center development, which is a very important component of our overall provider system offerings. And so, the company had been very intentional about adding urgent care centers, which is a low-cost capital entry into certain markets. It's a very efficient price point for our payers and our patients, and it starts a relationship in many instances with new patients that allow us to introduce the HCA system to them. I think, we will continue to see growth. We have moderated the development somewhat in 2018 in order to absorb and assimilate the number of centers that we've added over the last 18 months, but we anticipate picking up the pace again in 2019 and 2020 as we continue to evolve this particular component. In addition to that, we have our freestanding emergency room center development, which is complementary to that. We have roughly 75 freestanding emergency room centers across the company, with another 45 to 50 that are in development. Again, complementing our inpatient offerings and then also complementing our urgent care center strategy as well. So, the combination of both of those are very important to our provider system development.
Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC: Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Josh, thank you.
Operator: A. J. Rice from Credit Suisse, your line is open.
A. J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Hello, everybody. Maybe, I'll just ask about some payer dynamics. I know, you have a Medicare proposed rule on the table that has some interesting provisions on it. And then also just an update on where you stand with your managed care contracting and are you seeing any change in terms or change in approach to the business?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, A. J., this is Vic. I'll take the Medicare piece of it and then I think, Bill Rutherford will talk about managed care contracting. As you saw last week, we did see the IPPS proposed rule. Still it's proposed, we're still running numbers and looking at it. On balance, it looks better than what we have seen in recent years. I think, as you all know Medicare inpatient rates, they've ranged anywhere from up to 0.5 point to maybe 1.5 in recent years. This looks a little better for next year. We'll wait and see how it plays out when we see the final rule in August. But net-net, it does look a little better. Bill or Sam, you want to talk about managed care?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: A. J., on the managed care side of the equation and we've been saying this consistently now for multiple years, there are very few structural changes in how we have contracted and our trends on pricing on the commercial side of the equation. Our company has been very productive, I think, in building out competitive, relevant provider systems across our 42 domestic markets. And that's allowed us to have, I think, productive discussions with the payers on how to add value on their side, how to add value for their members and ultimately how to add value for HCA. So those discussions continue. We're largely contracted for 2018. We have roughly half of our 2019 and 30% of our 2020 portfolio contracted. I anticipate that accelerating over the next 90 to 120 days in both of those two years. But for the most part, our terms, our conditions, our network configurations and the value-based components of those contracts are relatively consistent with the past and aren't going through any material changes.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Sam. Thank you, A. J.
Operator: Moving next to Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot, guys. I guess just parsing through a lot of different metrics, it maybe seems like outpatient surgeries may have been just a touch softer than you guys thought. But there's obviously a lot going on. And I'm wondering just broadly if you think what you're seeing may be consistent with sort of an increased seasonality this year, maybe in part due to a bigger increase in deductibles or that sort of thing?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Anybody want to take a run at that?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: This is Sam again. I don't think that we can point to any unusual seasonality driving outpatient activity. I've heard people talk about, well, the heavy flu season resulted in people choosing not to have surgery. I can't really find that in any explanation from our teams. We actually grew our hospital-based outpatient surgeries very modestly, and we're down very modestly in our ambulatory surgery center divisions. A lot of that was because of the soft start that we had in the first week-and-a-half of the quarter. And again, I can't point to that. We actually accelerated outpatient surgical activity as we moved through the quarter, but for whatever reason the first week-and-a-half or two weeks were very soft, and it compromised the overall quarter's performance. We continue to remain focused on building out our outpatient surgery capabilities across the company. We're adding ambulatory surgery centers to our overall portfolio of offerings within each of our markets. We're continuing to add physicians as investors in many of these centers. And within our hospitals, we're able to create a very efficient outpatient environment for our surgeons who want to also operate on inpatients at the same time. And we think the combination of those offerings is very competitive and very responsive to our different constituents. But we're not seeing anything unusual in any particular market that would suggest any macro trend changes or seasonality or anything of that nature.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's really helpful. Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Milt, did you want to add?
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: No. I mean I just think that, I mean obviously just to add this one point. We have been seeing in the last several years, many years, more surgical volume in the fourth quarter. And so what Sam I think's referring to, we don't think that that's accelerated or changed. It's been a consistent trend for a number of years, and we continue, I think, to see that for the fourth quarter being a really strong surgical quarter for us and typically over the last several years, the first quarter has been a lower surgical quarter for us. So, that trend hasn't changed this year in any material sense.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Good, thank you. Thank you, Steve.
Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to Peter Costa from Wells Fargo Securities.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Can you talk about the Florida Medicaid rebid results for managed care? You saw a number of shifts in providers. Do you think that's going to help you guys in terms of picking up more business from in the Florida Medicaid, as we move to those new contracts?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, Bill or Sam.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: We have not seen across HCA's markets any significant Medicaid participation changes. So, we've been pretty stable on that environment. The issue for us is the recapture of outpatient reimbursement that was inappropriately implemented inside of the Florida state administrative process. So, we're hopeful that issue gets resolved and we recover the reimbursement that has been not applied properly. But from a managed care standpoint, we don't have any significant changes in our overall participation within the different networks. And we feel pretty good about where we are in total.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. I'm talking about going forward.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Peter?
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: In 2019, because the rebid just happened, and we've just seen the results, and you've seen Humana, in particular, is one of the bigger winners. I know they're one of the bigger contractors for you. And so, I'm curious if that's going to result in more business coming your way in 2019.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I don't have any visibility into that at this particular point in time, changing in any significant way our volume trends in the state.
Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Pete.
Operator: Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead.
Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning. Obviously, you're reaffirming your guidance today, but as I go back through and look at some of the underlying assumptions around your guidance, both from a volume and pricing standpoint, it looks like you're clearly ahead of schedule from the pricing side. So I'm just curious, how sustainable do you think the level of pricing growth that you have seen will be throughout the year? And certainly, from the volume side, it seems like some things are ramping back up there as well. So just wanted commentary on those two main drivers to your guidance. And then finally, I think Bill mentioned the growth in the uninsured volumes here. I'm just curious, how much of growth of uninsured volumes did you actually build into your guidance for 2018? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Frank. Thank you. Bill.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Let me try to make it. Yes, we are reaffirming our broad-brush guidance with our earnings kind of slightly above what our expectations were and others. I think we feel pretty good about that. Earnings per share was strong in the quarter, obviously. And I think that may push us on the higher end of that. All of our other major guidance after first quarter, we feel comfortable with and continue to affirm, and we'll obviously revisit that after the second quarter. As you know, our broad-brush guidance was 2% to 3% volume expectations, and 2% to 3% pricing expectations. We're within the volume for the first quarter. As you mentioned, pricing was favorable, driven by continued strong case-mix index that we started to see in the fourth quarter. So again, we'll keep our eye on that, but again, very displeased with the performance that we have off to the start of the year, and we'll continue to evaluate our guidance as we go through Q2. Regarding uninsured volumes, yes, we did report 10%. We had been seeing 5% and 6% towards the last half of 2017 growth. We've said before, based on our market complexion, I anticipate really a high single digit and that's kind of built into what our expectations are. As you've heard us talk about, and as you know, Florida and Texas represent about 70% of our uninsured volume and they contributed about 50% of the uninsured volume growth. That number can fluctuate from time to time as you have different kind of processes going on with Medicaid applications and so forth, so there are some timing issues that affect uninsured and when they may become Medicaid eligible. But in essence, this high single digit is built into kind of reasonable expectations for us. And obviously, I'll just remind everyone that the real impact of the growing uninsured is just that the incremental cost that we have to treat these patients, and I think with what we have built into our expectations, we can manage that and absorb that through the overall context of the core operations.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Let me add to that. This is Sam, Frank. I think when I look at our revenue growth in the fourth quarter and our revenue growth in the first quarter, both of them are pushing 6% on the domestic side of the equation as far as overall revenue growth. And part of that has been solid volume. And then obviously, we've had very good revenue per adjusted admission. Not all of that is coming from pricing. A piece of that is pricing. Part of it is coming from mix in the type of patients that we're getting, number one, and then the payer mix improving, number two. So, the combination of those two things has yielded revenue growth on the upper side of where we thought we might be, and so, those are positive metrics, we believe, and they really relate to significantly better revenue growth than what we had seen over the past six or eight quarters. And so, that's on a same facilities basis, so we're pretty pleased with how that's played itself out. And we think as we indicated throughout last year that the market would start to move more toward a normal growth rate in overall demand. Now, we don't have the fourth quarter market share data yet. We have the third quarter, and we're starting to see, we believe, some transition back to that normal growth rate that we were expecting on overall demand, and that's what's playing out. The other thing, I would say, is that in the quarter, we had tremendous inpatient revenue growth. Our revenue growth was about 7.3% on the inpatient side and roughly 4% on the outpatient side. That confuses some of the adjusted admission statistics, but it's a reflection of the acuity that we had inside of our inpatient business in the face of flu admissions in the quarter. So, very significant acuity across our inpatient book. And again, that's part of our strategy in trying to create more complex, deeper capabilities within our service lines so that we can take care of patients when they need really acute care inpatient needs. So, all of that sort of plays into how we're evaluating this quarter, and really the fourth quarter, as well.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Right. Frank, thank you.
Frank George Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Sarah James from Piper Jaffray, your line is open.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. I wanted to get your thoughts on some of the trends that are impacting payer mix, sort of more over the intermediate term. So first, the insurers are starting to talk about employers shifting their retirees over to straight Medicare as opposed to being part of their commercial coverage books. Is that impactful for you at all if that trend continues? And then second, we're seeing consumers that are kind of in the pre-Medicare age group like 63 to 64 starting to more frequently delay their surgeries in order to wait until they get Medicare-eligible because their cost share is lower. So, how are those two factors factoring into how you think about your Medicare payer mix going forward? Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Somebody want to take a wing at that?
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: This is Milt. Maybe I'll start by saying, I don't think we have any measurable data to drill down on those questions. I'm not aware of in our markets hearing any noise about shifting the benefits for retirees of corporate America, and that's not bubbled up as an issue for us. And certainly, whether there's deferrals of surgery for people approaching Medicare eligibility, I don't know that would be a new trend if it's out there. So again, really can't, I think, respond to that with any credible sort of data.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. And I think if you – again, if you just look at our numbers on the quarter, you look at the Medicare, growth was 2.5% to 3%. And really the number that sort of materially changed in my mind was the managed care exchange number, which was up 1% to 1.2% on admission and adjusted admission, when that was substantially better than what we've seen in recent quarters. So those are good mix shifts and good volumes.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. And this is Milt. As Sam mentioned, the payer mix in this particular quarter is actually quite favorable with managed care admission growth up 1%. And in the quarter – and that's the highest growth that we've had in probably going back into the first quarter of 2016. So again, the payer mix trends here in the quarter actually are pretty positive for us. Yeah.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: We'll hear next from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the points you were making earlier about the positive surprise in the acuity and the revenue per admission. And it feels like – I don't want to make any kind of trend assumptions, but a couple of your peers had pretty high acuity, as well. Was wondering if – when you look at this, is this because of specific service line improvements and you picking up share of higher acuity procedures and services from your competition or are you beginning to see kind of a floor, if you will, on how much mix is shifting from inpatient to other sites of service? And is that in any way correlated with payer mix and capacity utilization if you look at those things? And do you think this is a sustainable trend of 3 to 4-plus percent pricing growth?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Ana. Sam or...
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, we've had a – I think now – Bill, help me if I'm wrong, but five or six straight quarters of fairly significant case mix.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Index growth across HCA, more in the mid 3s or so in the first part of 2017, and then trending up above 4% in the latter half of 2017 and the first part of 2018. I think it's a combination of things, as you just indicated. It's difficult for me to point to them specifically, but we've had growth in a surgical activity in higher acuity surgical service lines like cardiovascular and orthopedic. On the medicine side of the equation, in both our neonatal units, as well as our adult critical care units, we've seen a more acute medical patient. That's part of it. We've clearly added service lines across HCA, whether it's trauma, burn, neurosciences and stroke capabilities in our facilities that results in a much more acute care offering when a patient requires that type of service. So, all of those converge – and this is not anything new. We've been talking about this being a core element of our strategy for the last 4 or 5 years. We think some of this is a yield from that. It's a yield from our capital spending. It's a yield from service line development. It's a yield from network integration. All of these pieces and parts add up. And this is a slow-moving business. And so, we think from that standpoint, it yields over time very positive metrics, and is central, like I said, to the strategic approach that we're taking within each of our markets. So, I can't really say that outpatient – transition from inpatient to outpatient is changing materially. If I had to pick, I would pick more toward our strategic approach, our development of service lines, our integration of our networks, yielding more of the growth than the slowdown in transition from inpatient to outpatient.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Thank you and have a good quarter.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Ana, thank you.
Operator: We'll hear next from Matthew Gillmor from Baird.
Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, thanks. I want to ask about the geographic discussion. Sam mentioned East Florida and the Far West as being weaker from an admissions perspective. I think you've called those markets out before. So, can you just give us a sense for the dynamics in those markets?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yes. East Florida continues to struggle with the issue that we've mentioned in the past, which is the observation statusing by many of our Medicare advantage payers and that's driven their inpatient volume metric down somewhat. Now, the growth in that issue was a little slower in the first quarter than what it was in 2017, but it continues to be a metric issue. We did have solid financial growth in the East Florida. Far West division is more of a California dynamic and our California hospitals struggled with their volume. Vegas was decent, that's also in the Far West division. And then in the Mountain division, which is primarily Utah and Idaho, we had some softness in our Idaho operations from a volume standpoint that brought the division down, but they were modestly down, and they weren't down as much as East Florida and Far West, but they were one of the divisions that were down. So, nothing strategic there of any significance. The Far West division and our California hospitals, I think, have some opportunities and we're making what I think to be some appropriate adjustments to deal with some of the dynamics there, and hopefully put us back on a growth platform in those markets.
Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thanks, Matthew.
Operator: We'll hear next from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning. Sam, just a follow-up to your answers to the last two questions. So as I think about the capital spending for the last three years and all the bed adds that you've done and seeing inpatient growth finally reaccelerate, how are you thinking about the ramp in terms of the productivity of the new beds that you're adding? And any quantification you can give us in terms of new capacity that has been added over the last two years just for us to be able to gauge kind of like the outlook in terms of being able to fill those beds and what kind of growth we should be looking at for that?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Brian. Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, I don't have all of those metrics in front of me, but I mean that's a piece of our – it's been a piece of our strategy, so it's in elements of our growth in the past. Having said that, we do have more capital coming online in 2018, 2019, and 2020 than we've had in recent years, so we're anticipating some acceleration in growth in those facilities as those capital items come online. It's important to understand, these capital projects are long-lived projects. They're very important to our long-term positioning in the market and very important to our strategy of being able to transition patients from outpatient centers to inpatient centers when they need more acute care. So, we have to have that inpatient capacity. Obviously, our outpatient capital starts to yield much more quickly as we get freestanding emergency rooms, urgent care centers, imaging centers, or ambulatory surgery centers online. Those tend to produce more timely than a longer lived inpatient asset capacity growth will. But we need to get – we'll get back to you on some color around how we're thinking about that. I just don't have that particular metric in front of me, and I don't want to guess at it at this particular point. But obviously, the company is operating, as we said before, at a high watermark on inpatient utilization. We're operating at almost 72%, on average inpatient occupancy, and in many instances, we have hospitals that are operating much higher than that. And so, it's important for us to have the inpatient capacity in order to receive the full benefit of our network development. On the outpatient side, in our emergency rooms in particular, as I've indicated in the past, we're running almost 90% utilization of our emergency room bed capacity, which is a very good metric of productivity, and such. And again, very important to our overall network strategy that we have ample capacity available when patients need our emergency room services. So, those are pushes as well on why we're spending money, but it also complements some of the service line development, physician strategies, and so forth that we have already mentioned on today's call.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Anything else, anybody? Okay. Thanks, Brian.
Operator: We'll hear next from Michael Newshel from Evercore ISI.
Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI: Thanks, good morning. I know you said labor costs are relatively stable, but going forward, do you expect to see any pressure there from inflation or increased competition for hiring or retention, given the tight labor market for nursing?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: This is Sam again. We're really pleased with how our facilities have responded. I guess it's been almost two years ago that we had some struggles with contract labor utilization, especially in our nursing areas. And at that particular point in time, our turnover for nurses was somewhere around 21% or 22%. We've actually dropped that particular metric to around 17%. That improvement, along with our comprehensive nursing agenda that the company has, and our human resource agenda, the combination of those is yielding, we believe, very positive results. Our contract labor on nursing was down almost 15% in the quarter, and we've seen overall contract labor drop for HCA. That has yielded a cost for FTE of around 2.8% I think or so in the quarter, which is a pretty good metric and in line with our expectations. Clearly, from one market to the other, we will have dynamics in the nursing community that we have to respond to with compensation programs and other type of programs, but the company's workforce development, the company's nursing agenda, and our ongoing connection to the marketplace and adjustments associated with that, we believe allow us to manage through these dynamics in a way that's not putting any undue pressure on the labor line at this point.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Michael.
Operator: Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America, your line is open.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great, thanks. Want to get a little more color on the uninsured volume. It's up pretty significantly, I guess, at a time when the economy is doing about as well as you could expect. Do you know what it is that's driving that type of volume? Is it the service lines that you're expanding that are bringing that in? And then to your point about how you view this as a good payer mix quarter, even with a 10% increase in uninsured volume. At what point does it become, I guess, a drag to earnings or is it really more about commercial? If commercial is up 1%, then it's kind of hard to come up with a bad payer mix on the rest of the business.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. Kevin.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Bill.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: This is Bill. Let me give a try on there. So, we did report 10%, and I think as I said earlier, if you look towards the latter half of 2017, we were in that 5% to 6%. So, it is slightly up from where we were running. Honestly, I'm not sure I can give you a whole lot of detail on why. We continue to hear from time to time in certain states slowdown of processing Medicaid applications that has a potential, potentially impacting the uninsured volume in any one quarter. Not really sure. But imagine flu may have had an impact on this, as we saw increased traffic in the emergency room. I think we go back to – really we don't see anything structural here, nor do I judge this increase to be a material factor for HCA, as we know. The impact is the incremental variable cost. So, we can accommodate that within the context of our overall guidance. So, we'll have to wait for a few more quarters. As I said earlier, I think our anticipation is we settle in that kind of high single-digit year-over-year trends and at those levels, I think we can manage through that. And we'll have to see how that plays out through the balance of the year.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Milt, did you want to add something?
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, I was going to add – I think this quarter, too – first quarter of last year was a low watermark for uninsured activity. I'm looking at – this is not the same stores consolidated numbers, a little bit higher than same stores, but we had 34,000 uninsured admissions in the first quarter of 2017. We had just over 38,000. So about 4,000 increase roughly. But when you look at the fourth quarter of 2017, we had almost 40,000. So, actually, we're down on a sequential basis first quarter to fourth quarter in terms of uninsured admissions. So, I think part of this percentage increase here in the first quarter is attributable to a comp last year where we were pretty low volume for uninsureds. And I would think, as we go throughout the year, I still think our assumption around high single digits is going to be a good assumption for us.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Good, thank you. Thank you, Kevin. About one or two more questions. We're running out of time here.
Operator: Next is Ralph Giacobbe from Citi.
Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to go back to the first question and make sure I got the impact of Oklahoma and the deal. Sounds like that was about a 310 basis point drag on EBITDA. So, is the way to think about that, normalized EBITDA growth closer to 8.5%, is that right? And then the Oklahoma pressure is going to remain, but again, can you help with sort of the ramp of the new deals and when you'd expect more incremental contribution as we think about sort of the balance of the year? And if I could sneak in one more, same facility EBITDA growth, can you actually give us what that is because you said margins expanded and same store revenue was up 5.7%, so EBITDA growth on a same store basis is going to be even higher than that? Just trying to get the magnitude there. Thanks.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, let me take this. First of all, you're right, it would have been about 8.5% sort of growth in EBITDA for the first quarter over last year, absent the impact of Oklahoma and the newly acquired assets. So that is correct, about 310 basis points drag on EBITDA growth from those. Obviously, we've got OU in our model for the rest of the year, and we do expect the acquisition drag that we have here in the first quarter to show improvement as we go throughout the rest of the year.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah. And this is Bill. Obviously, I'd add on to it, we have management plans being implemented, and we fully anticipate improved performance for the balance of the year. We believe in our Houston acquisitions, we'll be materially close to what our run rate is by the end of the year. As we integrate Memorial Savannah, I think that's a little bit longer ramp for us going throughout. We have confidence that we continue to hit kind of our overall expectations. We can offset any shortfall from our acquisitions due to the continued performance in the core business. And again, I think we remain confident at least in the long-term contribution of these acquisitions for the company.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Just time for one last question.
Operator: Your last question will come from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Wait a minute, Gary, I don't think so. We just ran out of time. Just kidding. Go ahead.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, I figured. I was a little surprised myself. I appreciate it. Actually, I just wanted to clarify a little something Ralph was touching on, maybe with just a touch more. I just want to make sure, it looked like Memorial closed about a couple days after you'd given previous guidance. I wasn't sure if that was in the prior guidance before or not. And then on this some-$30-million-odd of acquisition drag, you're saying it gets better through the year, which makes sense. Is it actually a little bit bigger drag in the 2Q because you have the full quarter of Memorial? And then finally, when do you think that net acquisition drag becomes a neutral number? Do we get into first quarter of 2019 before we escape that drag?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Hey, Gary. This is Bill. Let me – first of all, Savannah was not in our original guidance going through, you're correct. We closed on February 1, so it was not part of the original guidance going forward. Relative to Q2 and Q1, Q1 we are burdened with some transactional costs in that number. That won't reoccur in Q2, and we anticipate continued improvement, I think, throughout the year. And so, we'll have to wait and see what the Q2 performance looks like, but I think internally, we're expecting continued performance improvement. In terms of when they get to net neutral, I think we hope by the end of the year, we're on that kind of run rate.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Gary, thank you. Bill, thank you, and thank everyone for being on the call and Mark will be here to take calls all day if you need him. Thank you so much.
Operator: That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the HCA Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor Campbell: All right. Thank you, Tony, and good morning everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I'd like to welcome everyone on today's call, also to those of you that are listening to our webcast. Here this morning with me is our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Bill Rutherford, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President. Before I turn the call over to Milt, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, excluding losses, gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, and legal claims costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's fourth quarter earnings release. As always, the call is being recorded and a replay will be available later today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.
Milton Johnson: All right. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on our call and webcast this morning. This morning, we issued our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings release, and this morning's release also included our announcement of the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend, our three-year capital expenditure plan and guidance related to 2018 earnings expectations. Before discussing the release and certain details of the quarter, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on our 2017 performance. During 2017, we continued to invest in our growth agenda as we focused on adding access points to our networks, broadening service line capabilities, and expanding our depth in clinical service offerings. Over the course of the first three quarters of the year, our results were challenged by lower-than-expected volume growth and from losses associated from the effects of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. We closed 2017 with a solid performance in the fourth quarter with same facility adjusted admission growth of 2.3% over last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.1% over 2016 fourth quarter, and we finished the year 2017 with adjusted EBITDA slightly over 2016. We believe our fourth quarter results position us well as we go into 2018. On the cost side, I believe expense management was well executed, especially the improved results throughout 2017 in RE and turnover rates and contract labor. Labor rate growth was in line with our expectations for the year. Our clinical agenda remains robust, and I'm very pleased with our continued improvements and clinical outcomes as our investments in our clinical excellence programs are positively impacting care across HCA. Based on the latest Leapfrog quality ratings, 70.2% of HCA hospitals received a grade of A or B while only 55.9% of non-HCA hospitals achieved such ratings. We also saw improvements in our patient experience performance in 2017. We continue to advance technology initiatives in 2017. Big Data and mobility initiatives led the company's technology project portfolio. The use of our continuously expanding clinical date warehouse supports our clinical excellence program and positions us well for emerging approaches like artificial intelligence. Over the next three years, the company plans to deploy approximately 100,000 add-ons [ph] as part of our nursing technology agenda. Our physicians increased their mobility used by more than 75% in 2017 as we continue to expand functionality to improve their workflow and access to information. We believe our emerging mobility capabilities and our clinical insights from our clinical data warehouse provide greater physician and nursing engagement and improved patient outcomes. With respect to capital allocation in 2017, we continued our balanced approach by investing in capital expenditures in our existing markets, repurchasing our shares, and investing in acquisitions. We invested just over $3 billion in capital expenditures in 2017. We placed $1.1 billion of new capital in service in 2017, and project we will place $1.7 billion of new capital in service in 2018. We repurchased 2.05 billion of our stock in 2017 and expanded our healthcare footprint by acquiring eight hospitals and other health-related assets for $1.2 billion. Now moving to fourth quarter, we finished the year with a solid note with fourth quarter EBITDA - adjusted EBITDA of $2.362 billion, a record quarter for adjusted EBITDA. I'll leave further discussion of performance in the quarter for Bill and Sam, but we are pleased with the overall results in volume, revenue growth, and expense management during the quarter. We also remain confident in our strategies and believe they will position us well for the future. Moving to cash flows, we generated $5.426 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2017. We invested $3 billion in capital expenditures, distributed $448 million to non-controlling parties, producing free cash flow of approximately 2 billion. And as I mentioned earlier, we repurchased just over $2 billion of our stock in 2017. HCA repurchased approximately 25 million shares of our stock or approximately 7% of our outstanding shares since the beginning of 2017. As result of the recent passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we currently estimate the company's effective tax rate in 2018 to be 25%, and estimate that the reduction in cash taxes in 2018 to be approximately $500 million. It is our plan to reinvest these expected savings into our markets and into workforce development. This morning we announced an increase in our capital spending plans for 2018 through 2020. Capital expenditures over the next three years are expected to increase by almost 30%, $2.3 billion more than the previous three years, to approximately $10.5 billion. We are making these investments to add capacity, improve facilities, add new facilities, and enhance technology. We anticipate these expenditures should drive growth and job opportunities. With respect to workforce development, the company is increasing investments in four important areas over the next few years that we believe will create better opportunities for career growth for employees and better capabilities to serve our patients. These areas include, 1, investments in educational programs to improve the clinical abilities of our nurses and other caregivers; 2, tuition reimbursement for employees to support advancing their educational opportunities; 3, scholarship programs for qualifying employees and 4, an expanded family leave program. We anticipate spending up to 300 million over the next three years in these areas. We believe these programs will help increase patient experience and create more career opportunities for employees. This morning, we also announced the Board has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share on the company's common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record on the close of business on March 1, 2018. The initiation of our quarterly dividend demonstrates our confidence in the financial strength of the company, and the consistency of the cash flow it generates. The announcement today reinforces our commitment to delivering value to shareholders, while investing for future growth. I'll close my comments with a couple of follow-ups from 2018 guidance included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA, we expect to earn $8.45 billion to $8.75 billion in 2018, and our guidance assumes 2% to 3% volume growth, reasonable pricing, and well-managed expense growth. I'm looking forward to 2018, and believe the company is well-positioned to achieve our goals for the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review our 2018 financial guidance. Then I will turn call over to Sam for some comments on operations. We are pleased with the fourth quarter results. Volume, intensity, and good expense management led to a solid quarter and a strong finish to the year. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 7.1% to $2.362 billion, up from $2.206 billion last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 20.4% versus 20.7% last year. However, same-facility adjusted EBITDA margin increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, our same-facility admissions increased from 1.4% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 2.3%. During the fourth quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3% and 4.4% respectively. This included both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 6.4% on a same-facility basis and represented 34.5% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions declined 0.8% and 0.6% respectively in the quarter. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 6.4% in the quarter, representing 7.9% of our total admissions compared to 7.5% last year. Managed care and other, including exchange admissions declined 0.5% and equivalent admissions increased 0.5% on a same-facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 3.4% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter with our same-facility case mix increasing 5% compared to the prior year period. Same-facility inpatient surgeries increased 0.6%, and outpatient surgeries increased 0.8% from the prior year. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.5% in the quarter. Same-facility hospital, managed care, and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 6.8% in the quarter. This increase is mostly explained by higher acuity as our same-facility managed care and other case mix increased 4.8% compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $660 million in the quarter compared to the last year. Same-facility charity care discounts totaled $1.32 billion in the quarter, an increase of $280 million from the prior year period, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.78 billion, an increase of $380 million over the prior year period. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 3.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Same-facility salary, wages, and benefits per equivalent admission increased 2.7% over the prior year period, while same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 2.6% over the prior year. Same-facility other operating expense per equivalent admission increased 5.2% over the prior year period, primarily reflecting increases in various professional fee costs. On health reform, our results have remained fairly consistent throughout 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we saw approximately 12,100 same-facility exchange admissions as compared to the 12,300 in the fourth quarter of 2016. For full-year of 2017, our health exchange admission declined approximately 4% over 2016 levels, and represented about 2.6% of our total admissions. Our health exchange ER visits declined approximately 2.5% for the full-year of '17, and represent about 2.3% of our total ER visits. Health reform activity was generally in line with our expectations. As reported, earnings per share for full-year 2017 was $5.95 as compared to $7.30 in the prior year. 2017 results include a non-cash increase in the company's provision for income taxes of $301 million, or $0.81 per diluted share related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. This estimate may be refined as further information becomes available. In addition, the impact of the third quarter hurricanes unfavorably impacted results by an estimated $140 million or $0.24 per diluted share. The company also recognized an $82 million or $0.22 per diluted share tax benefit related to employee equity award settlements in 2017. 2016 earnings per share include benefits of $0.39 due to the Kansas City legal settlement, $0.41 due to tax benefits for employee equity award settlements, and $0.13 due to the completion of Federal Tax audits for 2011 and 2012. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $1.734 billion compared to $1.699 billion last year. For full-year '17, cash flow from operations was $5.426 billion, down $227 million from $5.653 billion last year, primarily from working capital changes. Capital spending for the year increased to $3.015 billion from $2.760 billion in 2016 as we continue to invest in long-term growth opportunities for the company. Cash flow from operations of $5.426 billion less capital spending of $3.015 billion in distributions to non-controlling interest of $448 million resulted in free cash flow of $1.963 billion for 2017. And as Milton mentioned, we completed a little over 2 billion of share repurchases during the year. We had approximately 1.8 billion remaining in our $2 billion authorization as of December 31, 2017. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.047 billion available under our revolving credit facilities, and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.0 times. These cash flow and balance sheet metrics continue to be an important strength for the company. So with that, I will move into a discussion about our 2018 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimated our 2018 consolidated revenues should range from $45 billion to $46 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $8.45 billion and $8.75 billion. Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admissions growth to range between 2% and 3% for the year, and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range between 2% and 3% for 2018. We anticipate our Medicare revenues per equivalent admission to reflect a composite growth rate of approximately 1.5% to 2%, factoring a market basket changes, HCA reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases. Medicaid revenues per equivalent admissions are estimated to be mostly flat year-over-year. Managed and other revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%, and we anticipate operating expenses per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5% to 3%. Relative to other aspects of our guidance, we anticipate cash flow from operations between $6.2 billion and $6.5 billion. We anticipate capital spending of $3.5 billion for 2018 as we see continued opportunities to invest in our markets and in support of key strategic initiatives. We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.2 billion, and interest expense to be approximately $1.8 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%. And lastly, our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 355 million shares for the quarter, and earnings per diluted share guidance of 2018 is projected to be $8.50 and $9. Earnings per diluted share guidance includes an estimated $50 million income tax benefit or $0.14 per diluted share related to employee equity award settlements and an estimated $480 million or a $1.35 per diluted share related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but does not include losses or gains on sale facilities, losses or retirement to debt or legal claim costs. So that concludes my remarks, and I will turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel Hazen: All right. Thanks, Bill. Good morning to everybody. I'm going to provide more detail on our volume results for the quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. My comments will focus on our on same-facilities domestic operations. Nine of 14 divisions had growth in admissions. Growth was especially strong in our North Florida, Tennessee, North Texas, and Capitol divisions, and conversely our East Florida and Far West divisions were weak. All other divisions were slightly up or slightly down in the quarter. Eleven of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions; 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits; freestanding emergency room visits grew 20%, while hospital-based emergency room visits increased 1.6%. Once again, growth was stronger in higher acuity visits, but we did see some solid growth in lower acuity visits also. Admissions through the emergency room grew by 2.5%. The company ended the year with 72 operational freestanding emergency rooms. We had 63 at the end of last year for 2016. Currently, we have 12 more that we expect to open at 2018 and another 21 in 2019. Trauma and EMS volumes grew by 6% and 3.5% respectively. Inpatient surgeries were up 1.1%. Surgical admissions were 28% of total admissions in the quarter, consistent with the prior year. Surgical volumes continue to be strong in cardiovascular and orthopedic service lines. Nine of 14 divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Outpatient surgeries were up also 1.1%. Volumes were up in both our hospital-based and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. Behavioral health admissions grew 3.2%. Rehab admissions grew 5.7%. Cardiology procedure volumes, both inpatient and outpatient combined were up 2.5%. Births were down 2.4%, which was consistent with the trend we have seen for the entire year. Neonatal admissions however increased slightly at 0.6%. Urgent care business for the company were up 10% on a same-facilities basis and 29% in total. The company ended the year with a 123 urgent care centers in its networks, up from 80 at the end of the last year. We anticipate another 15 centers to 20 centers will open in 2018. To recap the year, volumes across most categories and most divisions continue to grow. 2017 was the 10 consecutive year of same-facilities admissions and adjusted admissions growth for the company. Growth this year, as you heard, was slightly off our plan, most of the variants was explained we believe about low birthrates and less growth in emergency room visits. We remain confident about the prospects for long-run growth across HCA's portfolio of markets. As I have stated before, we believe healthcare demand for services in our markets will over time grow on average around 2% to 2.5% annually. We believe this demand is driven by the following factors: First, population growth; second, utilization increases driven by the aging of baby boomers; third, growth in chronic conditions; and fourth, strong and diverse market economies resulting in job growth. As you heard, we are investing more in our growth agenda with a planned ramp up in capital spending. We believe this increase in spending is compelling for a variety of reasons. First, we need to address inpatient capacity constraints. Inpatient occupancy levels for the company ended the year at an all-time high of almost 72% of operational beds. Over the past three years, we have added approximately 1,350 inpatient beds to our markets. We expect to add approximately 2,000 beds in the next three years. Second, within our existing markets, we are adding more outpatient facilities and creating a comprehensive and diverse array of facility offerings. Currently, we have approximately 1,800 outpatient facilities and clinics across the company; we estimate that we should have over 2000 by 2020. And finally, we are investing more in clinical technology and other types of technologies to enhance quality outcomes and experience for our patients, to improve the environment in which our nurses deliver care, and to make our facilities to preferred place to practice for physicians. In sum, we believe capital spending should allow us to capitalize on the growth and demand, drive gains and market share, and yield a positive return. I said this last quarter and I want to say it again, we continue to refine and enhance our efforts and our execution systems to improve and grow our business. We believe these refinements and enhancements will deliver value for our patients and physicians, create a better environment for our employees to work, allow us to compete more effectively in a dynamic marketplace, sustained growth, and thus drive shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call back over to Vic.
Victor Campbell: All right. Thank you, gentlemen. One quick thing Bill did want me to correct when he was giving you the average diluted shares in guidance for 2018, $355 million, I think he said quarterly, he obviously meant the full-year. All right. With that, Tony if you come on and pole for questions, and since we have so many on the call I do encourage you to hold your questions to one at a time.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan: Good morning. Sam had made a comment about attributing some of the weakness in 2017 to softness in vertical rates and ER visits. So, when you go back and look at your guidance for same-store growth in 2018, are you assuming that those particular trends that caused the weakness last year improved? Or, is it related to some of the CapEx investment or some changes in the local competitive environment? And then, also just any comments on the 340B payment? Is that built into your assumption? Thank you.
Victor Campbell: Okay, thank you. Bill, you want to do 340B, and then Sam will talk about -
Bill Rutherford: Yes, Frank, 340B would be built into our 1.5% to 2% Medicare growth rates we talked about.
Victor Campbell: All right. Sam?
Samuel Hazen: We are assuming at some level, Frank, that there will be a slight rebound in both of those areas. And that will help prop up the overall demand. We do believe, however, that there are other factors driving our guidance with respect to volume. And that is capital spending. Yes, our investment in outpatient facilities and physician strategies also and numerous other initiatives that have been sort of our core approach to the market all along. And we think those elements will allow us to recover market share gains again and ultimately compete, I think, in a marketplace that we believe is starting to recover slightly from where it was over the past 18 months and that's sort of our thinking.
Victor Campbell: Thank you, Frank.
Operator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.
A.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe I'll just try to ask about the M&A environment, consolidation environment. You are obviously coming off a great year on acquisition, a pick-up from recent years. Can you just tell us what you are seeing in terms of additional discussions? And then, on the flip side to the whole consolidation story is what we are seeing some of the non-profit big assistance consolidate. Does that present any opportunities or challenges for you guys? What is your perspective on that?
Victor Campbell: All right, AJ, thank you. I think Bill wants to lead with that one.
Bill Rutherford: Yes, with respect to the pipeline, AJ, we continue to have a lot of potential transactions that we are looking at. As you know, from following HCA, we are very disciplined with respect to acquisitions. We set pretty high bars as far as the characteristics of the market and asset positioning within the market. So - but we do have a pipeline. We are pleased with the number of transactions we were able to complete in 2017. Of course, we have the Savannah Memorial Health coming online probably within two days, on the 1st of February. And we are very excited about entering that new market and the prospects for our future in Savannah. With respect to some of the other consolidation activities, we don't see that having at this point a major impact on our outlook. We are not - when you think about those consolidations, we are not adding new competitors in any of our markets. They do may get benefit from scale. But again here over the intermediate term, we don't foresee those transactions that have been announced having an impact on our outlook.
Victor Campbell: All right, thanks AJ.
Operator: Next from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning guys. Sam, you talked about expanding the outpatient side as part of your CapEx strategy. How should we think about what the outpatient strategy is? Meaning what areas should we be looking at in terms of where the capital is going? And how do you view that in the grand scheme of things? The healthcare environment changes with United rolling out MedExpress and Walgreens facilities and CVS Aetna as well.
Victor Campbell: All right. Sam?
Samuel Hazen: First, let me say this when you think about the total spend that the company is incurring and forecasting over the next few years at 3.5 billion, obviously the biggest component of that is on our inpatient chassis where we have to add beds and other infrastructure capabilities, the aspects of outpatient facilities and such is obviously low capital cost per unit. And so, I think in the overall scheme of our capital budget, outpatient will never supplant - not never, institution is strong, unlikely to supplant sort of our spending on our inpatient facilities. It's important to understand that HCA has roughly 180 hospitals across the company. And like I said in my comments, we have about 1800 outpatient facilities already. And expect that to grow to about 2000 in 2020. The way we think about our outpatient strategy is looking at the hospital as an individual entity with outpatient offering if you will, for example, free standing emergency rooms attached to certain hospital, physician clinics attached to certain hospital, urgent care wrapped around all of that attached to certain hospital and certain components of the market. So, we look at all of these micro systems if you will. And they are centered around this notion of us needing to be comprehensive including ambulatory surgery and certain imaging capabilities in an outpatient environment. The outpatient space has always been competitive. In many markets, there is no certificate need on outpatient facilities today. And we continue to be, we think, responsive to the marketplace with our approach and our strategy. Our belief is that having a fully integrated network of inpatient facilities, emergency room, outpatient facilities, physician clinic is a very synergistic platform for achieving a growth, for better patient experience, for technology and information flow and so forth. And so, the care coordination process becomes a better method inside of an integrated system. And that's how we are thinking about it. And that's why we are investing, I think, consistently on both the inpatient side as well as the outpatient side. And I'll end with this, as we grow our outpatient facilities and activities, we have to have downstream capacity available in the inpatient space in order to receive the business that may start somewhere else in our network. That has been an ongoing effort inside of HCA to improve care coordination and try to keep the patient in the HCA system when they need further care downstream. So that's our approach. That's our strategy. We think it's responsive to the consumer, our physicians, and the marketplace as a whole.
Victor Campbell: All right. Sam, thanks. Brian, thank you.
Operator: Next is Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Obviously a much stronger fourth quarter versus your expectations. If you had to run through your dots on the drivers of upside in terms of splitting out between volume and price versus cost, the cost [Technical Difficulty] how would you split that out? And then if I can just squeeze a quick question on the interest deductibility, can you tell us what the adjustment should be to 2018 EBITDA that you're guiding to if we should multiply by the 30% number for interest deductibility and tax reform? I think it might be little different than the reported number. Thanks.
Milton Johnson: Maybe let me take the first question.
Victor Campbell: Okay.
Milton Johnson: To break it down, I mean, Justin, with the performance we had in the fourth quarter, obviously, the contribution - the improvement in volume, the acuity of that volume yielding a very good break on the volume on top of I think a highly effective cost management quarter contributed to the upside. And it's hard to maybe parse it out and break it, but it is one of those quarters where we really were pleased with the performance across all those metrics that are important to kind of produce this sort of result and beat the expectations for fourth quarter. But again, I am very pleased with the management team, our operators in the field and others that really like I said in my comments, we saw softer volumes in the first part of the year. We faced the hurricane and then in this fourth quarter to see solid volumes on top of really effective cost management, and again, the acuity growth in terms of that volume contributing to rate. So across the board, I think you would have to give credit to all three dimensions for the success of the quarter.
Victor Campbell: Thanks, Bill.
Bill Rutherford: And Justin this is William, the interest deductibility and the EBITDA year, we don't see any phase out the of the interest deductibility of any material nature in the first five years of the tax and jobs cut.
Victor Campbell: All right. Justin, thank you.
Justin Lake: Thank you guys.
Operator: Next to Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to focus back on the process around capital spending a little bit. Sam, can you just elaborate for how you guys analyze projects? How you prioritize your projects? And maybe just comment on the new areas of investment. How the returns compare versus historical returns and hurdle rates? Thanks.
Victor Campbell: All right, Sam?
Samuel Hazen: Well, we haven't really changed our process on capital spending for the last five or six years. I think we have a very comprehensive approach and a very detailed approach that we believe yields positive returns. And we have got a history of proving that, we believe. The process that begins with what I'll call capacity and utilization metrics that indicate to us where are we approaching a constraint that might prevent us from being able to grow in a particular market and like I said on the inpatient side, right now, we're running at almost 72% on average, which includes weekends when obviously hospitals do not have as many patients in them typically. Inside of our emergency rooms today or in 2017, we averaged 88% of our utilization target. That was our capacity utilization there. And so those are fairly tight metrics that we start with. The second thing we do is look at the growth opportunities within the particular market, whether it's a population trend, a physician group opportunity, a particular service line opportunity, a technology requirement, whatever the case may be to support our initiatives. We're evaluating that in the context of that particular market's dynamics. And then from there, we go through a process that still base initially, works its way up to me and the team up here, where we incorporate corporate perspectives before we sign off on a particular project. Our approach, like I said, has been to deliver sufficient capital to ensure that our facilities are maintaining their equipment and their curb appeal appropriately. That's our routine bucket as we typically call it and that average is probably 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion, let's just say. Then, we have about 250 million or so that we have for our IT initiatives that Milton alluded to in his comments and then the balance typically is centered around execution of our growth agenda, whether it's capacity on the inpatient or outpatient facilities. Again, we think our model is diverse. We're not investing in any concentrated fashion in any particular market. It's very distributed across HCA number one. Number two, it's distributed across hospitals within those markets. Number three, it's distributed across service watch, so we have a very conservative approach to capital allocation we believe across the portfolio of the markets. And then finally, I'll say this. Our belief is that adding capital to existing businesses, existing facilities, especially our inpatient operations is very synergistic. The fixed costs are largely intact. The medical staff is already there. The clinical reputation is there competitively in the market and then we have the network around it to support those investments and those projects tend to produce very positive returns for us. We did a study just recently where we went back and looked at all of our major projects over the past three or four years and with the exception of a couple of scenarios, we were exceeding our expectations, including an embedded organic growth component. So we're very pleased with the outcomes of our projects. It gives us confidence as we go forward and expand the overall spending levels for the company.
Operator: Next to Michael Newshel at Evercore ISI.
Michael Newshel: Can you remind us and sort of size how much EBITDA contribution you're expecting from last year's acquisitions and also how much margin expansion that you're baking into that or what trajectory that you expect the margins on those deals to get up to the existing base.
Bill Rutherford: The acquisitions will contribute roughly 70 to 100 basis points of growth next year. We've factored that in to our guidance. In the first year, they will come in at modest margins and so there will be a slight dilution effect overall as a company, we still anticipate around a margin maintenance after those acquisitions.
Operator: Next to Chris Rigg at Deutsche Bank.
Chris Rigg: Just wanted to ask about the London hospitals. I know there are pressure points in the first half of '17. That pressure moderated I think in the third quarter, not sure what happened in the fourth quarter and would love to get a sense for how you expect results there to trend in 2018.
Samuel Hazen: We did not perform well in the fourth quarter. It was a little bit below our expectations and you're right. We had a better third quarter than previous first half of the year, but unfortunately, we had a really difficult December in London and our results on a year-over-year basis were down $12 million when you look at it in US dollars. So it's not that tremendous. But we do think we're approaching, I'll call it the bottom and have the right strategies, both on the top line as well as restructuring our operations over there from a cost standpoint to respond to the marketplace and create a more stable environment for us as we go into 2018.
Operator: Next to Ralph Giacobbe at Citi.
Ralph Giacobbe: Can you talk a little bit about payer mix? Commercial seemed a little bit better this quarter, but still slightly down. Do you expect or what do you assume for commercial volume in 2018 and then the 6.8% yield on commercial, a pretty hefty number there, would you say we should focus more on that metric and sort of the revenue contribution of commercial as opposed to the volume metrics, just given the push by managed care to kind of push more of the lower acuity volume out of the inpatient setting?
Bill Rutherford: Ralph, this is Bill. I'll start. And then Sam or Milt can add on. We're duly pleased with the fourth quarter. We did see an improvement in the payer mix. As we mentioned, we had 0.5% growth in our managed and other on an adjusted admission basis. I would say going into 2018, we would expect a modest improvement in our commercial trends for next year. We've got that factored in to our guidance. You're right, the fourth quarter on a revenue per adjusted admission was high, it was all driven by acuity and case mix as we mentioned. I think over the longer period of time, as we indicated in our guidance that will settle in more in that 4% to 5% range over a period of time and that's pretty consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years. So that's what I think is best case to model our commercial book to look at.
Milton Johnson: Our commercial rates are consistent and '18 versus last couple of years. So again, the case mix in this quarter obviously was a boost to that rate, but as Bill said, we think somewhere in the 4% to 5% zone would be a reasonable expectation.
Operator: Next to Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Just wanted to ask a little bit about tax reform and how you guys are thinking about it, because it sounds like you're looking for about $0.5 billion of improved cash flow from tax reform, but you're taking up your CapEx number by $0.5 billion this year and it looks like on a three year number more like 900 million over the next few years, but you're not picking up your long term growth rate, so it seems like you're kind of spending all the tax reform benefit and not expecting an improvement in underlying operation. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that and why this increasing CapEx is not increasing your view about the organic growth opportunity going forward.
Milton Johnson: Yeah. I mean, I think we currently believe that we can grow our business a net 4% to 6% EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA zone. The capital that we're investment - these are long term investments in our markets. We expect them to continue as we have in recent years produced solid returns in yields for us. And if we can accomplish that again, that's how we intend to grow that 4% to 6%. And you follow us for a year, historically an organic growth company and as Sam has mentioned in his comments, we operate in really very good markets for healthcare. We see population growth, increase in chronic conditions, all the things that Sam mentioned and with the capacity constraints that we see in our markets, to continue to grow organically, we have to invest and I think we will drive very good returns off of those investments in the markets we're in. So, yes, we are increasing our capital spend, but I think the opportunities for us to sustain reasonable growth for our shareholders remains intact and not changing our growth expectations, but again, we've been saying for a number of years now, we think 4% to 6% is a reasonable zone for us. With respect to tax reform, as you know, the free cash flow we're generating, we're able to now with adding the dividend, as you think about returning cash to shareholders, we have been historically doing that with share repurchase. This further diversifies our approach to returning cash to shareholders. Now with a dividend being appease of that, very pleased with that, but also as you can see, our first priority remains reinvesting back in our existing markets. And so with the step up in capital spending, again, pleased to do that and pleased to have that announced too. So I think it's a very well rounded approach to capital allocation and one that I think will yield very good returns to shareholders over the years ahead.
Operator: Next to Josh Raskin, Nephron Research.
Mary Shang: This is Mary Shang on for Josh today. I didn't hear anything on the floor and I'm sorry if it was a material challenge to volumes in the fourth quarter. We've been hearing it's been a more severe season and you're anticipating discontinued into the first quarter?
Samuel Hazen: Sure. The flu contributed somewhere around 0.5% to our admission statistic in the month or in the fourth quarter. Most of that did occur in December. And then, for our emergency room visits, I think it was about 0.9% of our activity was attributable to flu. So there was some modest element of flu activity in the quarter, but what was interesting, the non-flu volume, as Bill and Milton just spoke to was incredibly intense and acute and that's how we were able to deliver case mix index growth in the face of flu growth in the quarter. So really spoke to our core business being very strong in the period.
Operator: Next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo.
Peter Costa: Back to tax reform again, but a little bit of a different take on, my question is how do you see that impacting your conversations with managed care providers in terms of rate negotiations and also how does it impact your views of hospital purchases in terms of purchase price paid since the free cash flow goes up, even if EBITDA doesn't.
Samuel Hazen: We're not getting in the short run any significant change in negotiations with the managed care companies as a result of tax reform. We think there is still certain trends in our business, certain trends in their business and we don't believe that's going to radically change the discussion there. And as Milton indicated, we're 85% contracted in 2018 already. We're roughly 50% contracted in 2019 and around 25% to 30% in 2020. So we do have some open contracts out there, but we think that the discussion is more centered on the core business, and not necessarily the tax reform.
Bill Rutherford: And Peter I would just add that the managed care companies are benefiting from tax reform as well. So it's not just one side picking up the benefits. And on the M&A model, it's a factor in there, but as Milton talked about, our primary thing on the M&A is making sure we're in a strong market with a strategic asset. That's our primary focus in the acquisition side. Clearly, there might be some incremental benefit with historical versus perspective taxes, but that's more secondary in our analysis.
Operator: Next Ana Gupte with Leerink.
Ana Gupte: So as you look at the volume trends, which are really strong, congratulations, is this something that's going more to APA and you're picking up more share from your competitors or is this more sort of an industry wide trend. And to the extent that it's market share in the tax reform, is the playing field is getting more leveled with the not-for-profits, do you think that should again accelerate the volume growth going forward.
Samuel Hazen: We don't, at this particular point in time, have fourth quarter market share data, so it's difficult to say exactly how the quarter is stacking up from a market share gain standpoint. Our market share, as I've indicated in the past, and as the current data which is through the second quarter of 2017 indicates, it's stable and it hasn't been growing like it did in the previous periods as we've indicated in the past. So we're anxious to see what the third and fourth quarter data will show. We do believe that we have the right approach, however, to delivering market share gains again for the company, some of this is connected to all the points we've been making throughout this call. So we're very confident we think in our approach to our systems from one market to the other, being able to compete and hopefully gain market share. What was the last question? I'm sorry. I think that you're right. Most of our competitors in HCA's markets are tax exempt systems that aren't benefiting from the tax reform act that was passed. And so for us, it does create an advantage by comparison to them and we think we're trying to utilize that advantage appropriately as Milton indicated with investments in our communities and investments in our workforce, so that we can deliver a better service to our patients and have the necessary capacity to really benefit from the growth strategies that we have.
Operator: Next is Gary Taylor of JPMorgan.
Gary Taylor: Nice quarter too that same store revenue growth fell into your range, which was good. My question is about same store revenue guidance, the 46% that you talk about, if we exclude '14 and '15 where the ACA was having a positive impact, really we have to go back to 2009 since the last time you approached the low end of that same store revenue growth range. So really you're telling us that you think the business will accelerate and it's very different message from what we hear from the rest of the industry and the growth headwinds that you've cited aren't new necessarily. So I guess the question is, how do you have confidence that 4% to 6% same store revenue isn't just incorporating some of the tailwinds you've talked about demographics, et cetera but is also appropriately contemplating some of the headwind for hospitals over the next several years.
Samuel Hazen: Gary, when we look at our domestic operation - our same stores domestic operation revenue in 2017 grew by 4.2%. And this was on sort of a slower growth platform that we've experienced in past years. So I think from the standpoint of total revenue growth, we're in a pretty good spot we believe with the guidance and with our experience. I'm not sure I understand your point vis-à-vis our actual performance this year.
Bill Rutherford: And Gary, can I add one more, you threw out kind of the health reform years, but recall on those health reform years, not only do we have the benefit of health exchanges, but as we said throughout that period of time, our organic non-health exchange was really robust during those period of times. So I'm not so sure, if you exclude those periods, we're below the 4 as a starting point holds up for us.
Operator: Next is Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs.
Steve Tanal: But I guess just a follow-up on a couple of points. I didn't hear sort of the outlook on flu in 1Q. I mean, obviously, it looks like the flu has accelerated. If you could just give us some flavor for what you're expecting there and how that impacts the outlook. And then just on the CapEx plan, any color on sort of threshold IR hours that you could speak to or how you think about quantitatively deploying capital in some of the markets.
Milton Johnson: Steve, let me just say one thing. We don't provide guidance in a mid-quarter. So we won't really get into the flu for the quarter. Obviously, you can see the stats out with CDC and what have you, they're pretty strong. But we don't provide interim quarter guidance.
Bill Rutherford: I think on the CapEx, I think as Sam was describing the different types of capital investments, we clearly go through a pretty rigorous review of those looking at kind of the market demand, financial returns, and I would say that every project goes through its own analysis in terms of financial returns and internal rate of returns. Generally, when you're characterizing those growth investments that are either in patient capacity or even expansion of our outpatient network, they're meeting above company standards returns. And again as we look at it as a portfolio, we think we've got this consistent kind of track record of growing return on invested capital. So there is really no hard and fast kind of one threshold that we use. Each project and each type of project would generally stay on its own, but all of them generally would come with attractive returns that we factor in to our decision to go forward with the investment.
Operator: Thank you. We will take that final question from Sarah James at Piper Jaffray.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] for Sarah. So you touched on artificial intelligence in your prepared remarks. Can you dive a little deeper into how HCA is looking to apply this technology and how that will help you reduce the cost or improve the quality of your care?
Victor Campbell: All right. Jon Perlin, our Chief Medical Officer. Jon?
Jon Perlin: We took the opportunity to use meaningful years to replatform in a way that we can capture all of the data, every one of our clinical encounters. These clinical encounters provide really a lot of fuel for understanding quality and safety as well as efficiency in the capacity for growth. We used the artificial intelligence to do everything from changing workflow to making for efficient, for example, supporting patient application to identifying more efficient ways for care delivery. Early identifications have set us as such an example. So it's really fueled for supporting every aspect of our operations.
Victor Campbell: We will thank all of you for joining us and look forward to seeing you in the coming year.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir. Victor Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc. All right, John. Thank you and good morning, everyone.

A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's third quarter earnings release. As you heard the call this morning is being recorded and a replay will be available later today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.
Milton Johnson: Thank you, Vic and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or the webcast today. Before we go into details about the quarter, let me take a few moments to say a few words about the unprecedented sequence of events that began with hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi and Houston, followed by Hurricane Irma in Florida and then the tragic shooting of Las Vegas. As you know we have significant presence in all these markets. In Texas, hurricane Harvey first made land fall near our Corpus Christi market where we have a hospital with three campuses and two freestanding emergency rooms. From there it moved to Houston where it dumped record amounts of rain causing significant flooding for days. In Houston market we have 15 hospital campuses, six freestanding emergency rooms, five surgery centers and one freestanding cancer center. All of these facilities were affected either directly or indirectly. Certain hospitals were evacuated and several resumed evacuating patients from our hospitals and in some cases from non HA hospitals. Several of our hospitals in Dallas, Austin and San Antonio also took evacuated patients. Now, we work on facilities affected by Harvey, where we have approximately 14,000 employees in Houston and Corpus Christi, many of them are still recovering from personal loss. Just days after Harvey, hurricane Irma struck South Florida sending a path of destruction from south to north across virtually the entire state. Florida of course is one our biggest states with 50 hospital campuses, 32 surgery centers, 17 freestanding emergency rooms, 10 diagnostic imaging centers and more than 63,000 employees. Once again, we evacuated certain facilities and felt the impact of Irma throughout all of Florida and to a lesser extent even into Georgia and South Carolina. Then as we were recovering from these natural disasters came the horrific shooting in Las Vegas. As a closest trauma center to the concert side, HCAs Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center received approximately 200 victims in one hour. For the entirety of the event, 127 patients with gunshots were in intensive care. All 30 operating rooms were immediately activated and operated throughout the nine following days. In all more than 80 operations were performed. As a relative trauma center, Sunrise dealt with many of the most severely injured patients. Meanwhile Southern Hills and Mountain View hospitals took those less critical and made sure Sunrise had all the necessary staff, supplies and equipment to manage the situation. While we have very robust disaster preparedness in mass casualty plans in place nothing could have completely prepared us for this [indiscernible] sequence that announced. I now will speak for entire management team in saying that never been in a time when we were more proud of the incredible team and professionals those lay throughout the organization. Our colleagues at every level of the company, but especially in those communities performed beyond any expectations we can have and demonstrated the best of the HCA culture. Now moving to spend a few moments on my thoughts around the third quarter, the hurricanes along with Texas Medicare waiver reduction in the quarter add complexity to the evaluation of the third quarter results. However if you look at the broad trends to normalize with the destruction in the hurricane affected markets, we believe many of the trends are comparable with the first half 2017, Sam and Bill will provide detail on some of these trends in a moment. Third quarter revenues increased 4.2% to $10.7 billion compared to the prior year. Hospitals acquired during 2017 contributed approximately $155 million to the increase in revenues in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totalled $1.776 billion down $181 million in the prior year. As mentioned in our earnings release the estimate to hurricanes unfavourably impacted our third quarter performance by approximately $140 million or $0.24 per diluted share an increased $0.06 in losses of revenue in our Corpus Christi, Florida, Georgia, in South Canada markets. Also results for the third quarter were negatively impacted by $50 million or $0.08 per diluted share associated with Texas Medicare waiver settlement amounts. As mentioned earlier volumes remained somewhat consistent with the first half of 2017 with same facility admissions increased to 60 basis points and improvement admissions increasing 30 basis points in the prior year. We estimate that the hurricanes had an unfavourable impact of 80 bases points on same facility admissions growth in 80 basis points in same facility equipments admissions growth. This represents the fourteenth consecutive quarter of the equivalent mission growth the company. Our same facility Medicare admissions comprised 45.5% of the company's overall admissions while our same facility managed care and exchange admissions were 27.2% of total admissions compared to 44.7% and 27.8% respectively in the priors year's third quarter. As we noted in October '18 third quarter preview, we have updated our guidance for 2017. We currently estimate adjusted EBITDA will range for 28 and 8.15 billion for 2017. This does includes the estimated impact of hurricanes in the Texas Medicaid Waiver program Settlement amounts. Earnings per diluted is now estimated to range from $6.45 to $6.70 per diluted share. Cash flow operations totalled $1.008 billion compared $1.206 billion in the third quarter of '16. The decline is primarily attributed to the 215 million declines in net income. Our days in AR increased slightly to 51 compared 50 days at year end and 49 days at the end of the second quarter. We remain active with share repurchase in the quarter. We repurchased 6.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of $509 million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we have repurchased 17.8 million shares at a cost of $1.475 billion. As you may have seen this morning, the company announced that the board has approved the new $2 billion share repurchase authorization and at October 31, 2017 including this newly announced program and the remaining authorization on the company's November 2016 program, the company has approximately 2.150 billion authorize for share repurchase. Finally, an update on M&A activity, during the third quarter we closed the acquisition of 5 hospitals in Texas for approximately $880 million. Also in October 1, 2017 we closed on a previously announced Rutherford Texas acquisition. That brings total M&A activity for the year to seven hospitals with two more pending which we believe should close some time in the fourth quarter. The previously announced divestiture of OU Medical Center is now estimated to close on December 31of this year. And so, with that I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William Rutherford: Good morning everyone. I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and results for the third quarter. As we reported in the third quarter, our same-facility admissions increased 0.6% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 0.3%. Year-to-date same-facility equivalent admissions are at 1.2% over the prior year. As Milton noted, we estimate the hurricanes negatively impacted same-facility admissions growth by 30 basis points and equivalent admission growth by 80 basis points. In addition, the less of a business day compared to the third quarter of '16 also impacted some volume statistics. Sam will provide more commentary in a moment and I'll give you trends by payer class. During the third quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.4% and 3% respectively, compared to the prior year period. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare admissions. Managed Medicare admissions increased 4.9% on a same-facility basis compared to the prior-year period and represent 34.1% of our total Medicare admissions. On a year-to-date basis, Medicare equivalent admissions are up 3.4%. Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions declined 1.8% and 2.2% respectively in the quarter, compared to the prior-year period. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 6.4% in the quarter. These represent 8.4% of our total admissions compared to 8% in the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date our same-facility uninsured admissions were up 5.7% from same period last year. Managed care and other, including exchange admissions, declined 1.7%, and equivalent admissions declined 1.9% on a same-facility basis in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 0.3% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and as we stated in the release, we estimate the hurricanes had a 30 basis point impact on our emergency room growth in the quarter. Same-facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 20.3% of our total ER visits in the quarter, compared to 19.9% last year. And on a year-to-date basis, same-facility emergency room visits have increased 0.7%. Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same-facility case mix increasing 3.3% compared to the prior year period. Same-facility inpatient surgeries declined 0.7% and outpatient surgeries declined 4.2% from the prior year, reflecting the impact from hurricanes in our South Texas, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina facilities. When adjusted for the hurricane impact and one less business day, we estimate outpatient surgeries declined approximately 0.7% in the quarter. During the third quarter, same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2% from the prior year. Our hospital same-facility managed care, other, and exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.1% in the quarter and 4.6% on a year-to-date basis compared to the prior year. The growth rate in the third quarter was impacted by the comparison to a strong 6.5% growth recorded in Q3 of 2016 and some hurricane impact due to the lower surgery volume. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $369 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care totaled $1.19 billion in the quarter, an increase of $155 million from the prior year period. Our same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.447 billion, an increase of $214 million over the prior year. Our uncompensated levels have trended in line with our uninsured and revenue trends. Now, we turn to expenses. There is a lot of noise in the quarter from hurricanes that affected our expenses making it more difficult to compare expense trends on a quarterly basis. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 4.5% compared to last year's third quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.6% for the quarter as compared to 19.1% in the third quarter of last year. Same-facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 4.9% compared to the last year's third quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue increased 140 basis points compared to the third quarter of '16, primarily reflecting hurricane related costs. We are pleased that we have seen reduction in our nursing turnover from 20.2% last year to 18.3% this year. This aligned to a sequential improvement in contract labor on a same-facility basis and total contract labor has grown 2.2% over prior year in the quarter. Same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 2.2% for the third quarter in the prior year period and supply cost as a percent of revenue increased 10 basis points. We continue to see sequential improvement in supply expense as a percentage of revenue during 2017. Other operating expenses as a percent of revenue increased 90 basis points from last year's third quarter to 19.4% of revenues primarily reflecting increases in year-over-year contract services and professional fees that we discussed on our last two calls. This metric was also impacted by hurricane related costs. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Cash flows from operations totaled $1.008 billion. Year-to-date cash flows from operations were $3.692 billion and free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interests was $1.296 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.037 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.08 times at December 31st, 2017, compared to 3.82 times at December 31st of 2016. Let me speak briefly on our health reform activity. In the third quarter, we saw approximately 12,200 same-facility exchange admissions as compared to approximately 12,900 we saw in the third quarter of last year for a decline of 5.8% year-over-year and 4.9% declined sequentially from the second quarter. We saw about 46,700 same-facility exchange ER visits in the third quarter compared to the 49,300 in the third quarter of 2016 and 52,400 in the second quarter of '17 for a 10.9% decline sequentially. These health reform results are pretty consistent with what we have been seeing in the year and generally speaking track with the Roman activity we see in our markets. So, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel Hazen: All right. Thank you, Bill, and good morning to everyone. I'm going to provide some additional detail on our volume trends for the quarter as compared to the third quarter of last year. On a same-facilities basis for our domestic operations, 8 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions. Growth was especially strong in our North Florida, Tennessee, Capitol and South Atlantic divisions and conversely our East Florida, Far West, Mid America, Central West Texas and Gulf Coast divisions were weak. East Florida and Gulf Coast were obviously impacted some by the storms, but we believe both markets have recovered well with no indications of permanent issues. All other divisions were slightly up or slightly down for the quarter. Eight of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions; 8 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 18%, while hospital based emergency room visits declined 1.5%. Once again most of this decline was seen in lower acuity visits. Admissions through the emergency room grew by 1.6%. Trauma and EMS volumes grew by 7% and 1% respectively. Inpatient surgeries were essentially flat. Surgical admissions were 28% of total admissions in the quarter. Surgical volumes were strong in cardiovascular and orthopedic service lines. Seven of 14 divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Outpatient surgeries were down 4% and volumes were down in both our hospital based and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. We have one less business day in the quarter as compared to last year in the storms heading effect. Behavioral health admissions grew 4.1%. Rehab admissions grew 4%. Cardiology volumes grew 5%. Births were down 2.5% and neonatal admissions were essentially flat. In summary, after adjusting for the estimated impact of the hurricanes, our volume trends were generally consistent with the first half of the year. As I stated in my comments last quarter, we believe the growth in inpatient demand in general has moderated across most of our markets over the last year, which we believe explains most of our softer volumes. For the 12 months ended March 2017, which is the most current data available, inpatient market share for HCA increased by 10 basis points as compared to the previous period. Now, let me transition to our operations in London. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter for this market was down 12% and both local currency and dollars were approximately $6 million. This decline is less than the last quarter and represents a better overall performance for this division. We anticipate continued improvements in our results over the next few quarters. Overall we continue to refine and enhance our efforts to improve and grow our business. We believe these refinements and enhancements will deliver value for our patients and physicians, allow us to compete more effectively in a dynamic marketplace and ultimately sustain growth for the company. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.
Victor Campbell: Thank you, Don, if you come back on and let's pull for questions. I would ask that each questioner limit themselves to one question, so we can give everybody an opportunity. Don? Don, are you with us?
Operator: Yes. Thank you. Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. So, Sam, on the call you mentioned that you think inpatient demand is down across your markets. I wanted to get the company's - in a broader view of how we should think about the typical algorithm to what I think you described as 4% to 6% EBITDA growth in terms of market growth, plus market share growth et cetera, plus leveraging the fixed cost to get to that 4% to 6%. If market growth stays where it is today, what do you think a reasonable EBITDA growth rate for the company would be in the near to intermediate term? Thanks.
Samuel Hazen: Let me start on the demand point of your question. Justin, I'll let Bill jump in here on some of the other components. Inpatient demands for HCA's markets are still growing. In the first quarter of 2017, which is the most recent data available, our markets, 42 markets grew up 0.8% that's a little bit below our expected level of growth as we think about the overall factors that drive demand for healthcare services in our markets. If you normalize that a little bit for leap year, it probably grew about 1%; 2016 grew at about 1.4% to 1.5% for inpatient demand and we use that as a general proxy for overall demand with some aspects of outpatient growing faster than that. So, we still are confident that the prospect for growth in HCA's markets is still good. We have indicated in the past and we continue to believe that over the long run inpatient demand in healthcare services in HCA's markets is going to grow somewhere around 2%. It could be a little bit more, a little bit south of that depending on a number of factors. Our belief around population growth, utilization increases for aging baby boomers. Chronic conditions and the growth in diabetes and cancer and other obesity, those kind of things are driving demand. And then when you look at the market economies, we still believe there's going to be solid job growth across HCA's markets. So, the company is investing inside of this belief around demand. We're relieving capacity constraints. We're adding outpatient facilities to our network and we're putting ourselves in a position to really compete at a high level. And so, our approach is built around volume growth. We have to have volume growth I think to be successful. We've had modest volume growth this year in a difficult period with modest market share gains. For us to get to our volume objectives, we have to pick up 20 to 25 basis points of market share, not 10, so we're a little bit short where we want to be. Again some of that is market-specific. Some of it is competitor-specific, but over the long haul we think we are in a position to achieve that objective and that is obviously a starting point for our ability to achieve our EBITDA targets that we've laid out. I'll let Bill or Milton carry forward on the follow through on that question.
Milton Johnson: Yeah, Sam I've been - just I'm not sure what add to that, but I'll just echo Sam, we still believe in our 4% to 6% long-term EBITDA expectations for the organization. As Sam mentioned, we believe that because of our attractive markets. The population grew. The aging of population were seen in our markets. Good economic conditions in our markets. We've got, as you know, roughly 25% market share on a composite basis in these markets. We're making substantial capital investments in the markets, including adding some acquisitions. I mentioned seven new hospitals this year, all of those not contributing to earnings growth. In 2017 we expect those acquisitions to contribute to grow in the out years. Our team's execution, their track record of execution, all of those things combined gives us confidence in our guidance for long-term EBITDA growth of 4% to 6%. Obviously this year has been a challenging year where we're not going to meet that expectation, but if you look back over recent years, we've had years in the last five years where we've exceeded that expectation with a five-year CAGR of just under 6%. So, again all that goes into our thinking about the long-term growth expectations for HCA.
Victor Campbell: All right. Justin, thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Maybe I just want to follow up on that question. Would you please think about why the volume number this year is likely to be less than your long-term target? What is it about 2017 and obviously leap year and hurricanes, but even if you exclude those things, you are still coming in below what you would expect to do long-term on volumes? So, what is it about the backdrop today that makes it a challenging backdrop and why would it get better next year? There doesn't seem to be a lot of obvious areas of market improvement heading into next year versus this year.
Samuel Hazen: I don't know. This is Sam again. I don't know that I have every answer to 2017. I mean some of this is a judgment about what we see in the market and if you look back over the last three or four years, it was never the same metric in each of those three or four years. So, one year may grow 3%. One year may grow 1.8%. And so, if you're looking at it over a bit of a longer run, you get to an average that seems to be a reasonable proxy for going forward forecasts around volume growth in our markets. I mean there has been some level of competition as we've indicated in the past in certain outpatient arenas that can have some downstream implications for us, but that has moderated as I said on the last call and we've seen some saturation if you will of development in certain outpatient elements that have slowed that issue down. So, I think when you look at where we are trending when you normalize for some of these factors, this is just one of those years I believe where the market has been a bit overheated in the past and maybe it just moderated. But from my standpoint and from the studies that were done, we see no reason that it won't move to the norm over some reasonable period of time. We don't have all of our 2018 budgets finalized yet, so we're not in a position to really provide guidance on that particular year. But if you think about it in the context of the next two to three years, we think growth over that cycle is going to be somewhere consistent with this 2% number.
Victor Campbell: Thank you, Kevin.
Operator: We'll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan: Good morning. I appreciate the color on the third quarter volumes relative to the first half of the year. But I'm curious could you give us any just general commentary about what you're seeing so far in the fourth quarter related to any kind of volume recovery, the normal seasonal volume recovery you would see and then is there any difference in the recovery that you're seeing between hurricane affected and non-hurricane affected markets? Thanks.
Samuel Hazen: Sam. Well, I can't really give a company view on the volumes coming out of the gate in the fourth quarter, but I will say this. Houston and Miami, which I said in my comments, the indications coming out of the gate in the gate in the fourth quarter given the significance of the aversion to the market, does not suggest any permanent issues, as that would be able resolve the hurricane. So, in Houston we are actually tracking slightly above last year, and in Miami market was slightly below, but we did not estimate why that it is. And it's not related to any kind of permanent market damage, in either of those two markets.
William Rutherford: Right thank you, as you know our practice is we don't talk about third quarter, but that obviously will command over the Columbus hurricane market, so you understand where they stand. Alright, next question.
Operator: We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thanks, good morning, sort of going back home to the first couple of questions I guess. Despite the pressures you've seen you've been still able to put up 3% same facility revenue growth, obviously this quarter is impacted by the hurricane, which we add that back. You haven't been able to deliver EBITDA, so, are there things you can do amidst cost side that will make you think you could hold the line on margins in 3% top line trend, so as sustained in the next year, or do you really think you need that 4% level plus the whole market?
Samuel Hazen: Yeah, we'll take that, I think that we historically shared that the 4% low level, that's one element from the Miami margin maintenance. Clearly this quarter margin was impacted by the sloppy revenue due to hurricanes, the waiver programs as well as the cost trans in the hurricanes. I also mentioned the acquisitions that we came and didn't cover our margin contribution awareness, so all that will come into play. But, I think that we said that early, you know are right on the lower end of our guidelines, we still anticipate margin maintenance. I think we've got a track work of continuing to maintain that the cost structure; we got a lot of initiatives on the way, will it be our supply cost initiative, continued opportunities on which in the land berg agenda as we have some success in various initiatives through additional nursing turn over. So, I still believe that the 4% level, we still anticipate a margin minus level.
Ralph Giacobbe: Thank you very much
Operator: We'll take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho.
Sheryl Skolnick: We don't make calls though, we do write research, thank you very much gentlemen. So, first let it be said, very fitting tribute to the hard work that was done and the commitment and compassion of all the people who cared for everyone else during this quarter in very difficult times - pace to remember the year in hospital business and we can't forget that. But with that we still need to understand and I think the over questions run 2018 probably aren't going to help us. So, maybe I'll stay back and ask a different question about the company's forward-looking strategy. The first time in a long time you are doing acquisitions, you're still committed to a grow market share build the depth most integrated, strongest best quality hospital systems in market. You've invested a time and big data which we haven't about on these calls, I presumably you've done to add to the value creation on a day-to-day basis and forward. So, Will can you frame what the strategy in terms of, it sounds like you are adding to the usual day-to-day, what we've come to expect from HCA outstanding execution and brilliant market. But, it sounds like you are adding another like to the store and that there are more things that could come to play, next year or the year after from the perspective of strategy, the company is pursuing, so please enlighten us?
William Rutherford: Sure, so we have been more inquisitive this year, we've had more opportunities in you need know our company and that we are not that very comfortable should they have a certain number of hospitals. We look to acquire hospitals and markets, where we see long term positive popular demand growth opportunities. And, we theatrically want to have the relative amount of market share going into our new market. You know in Savannah, gives us that, as I've said in my comments, we hope to close in Savannah about the end of the year, and we are excited about the opportunity to go into a new market. There are lot of hospitals for children, hospitals are more supplementary to our existing markets like Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio or Jacksonville. We will continue to look for those opportunities. We today are final on ramp positions is really good, as I said, I mean for last calls, it's probably the best pipeline we had and maybe in 15 years or 20 years. And so, marked up on more flabby opportunities, so, we continue to look for those in add that to our strategy going forward. With respect to big data, there we have invested quite a bit, and it's already contributing. Where you see the contribution, we see it in a number of ways, but primarily and most importantly we see it in quality inside the care way it provides. I was using our clinical data to improve care in our hospitals, is something that we are making right start in, I know we are just getting started, like the interface is getting started there. But we are making a difference anyways saving the lives of the treatment of Sceptisis, blood utilization and another and number of other areas. So, we all continue to invest in that area continued to be benefited from that for our patients. And of course that attracts great positions, which of course contributes to our growth strategy as well overall. So, all that is part of our strategy Sheryl, I think that we will continue to look for growth opportunities, freelance positions and also growth opportunities through using proprietary information like our big data and how we can use that to continue to leverage our position in the markets.
Samuel Hazen: That's great Jon, perhaps you're chief medical directive, you want to add anything to that.
Jon Foster: Sure, thanks for the question already sided with out guard using the daily channel rated by product occasionally, to cure, to heal, continuous improvement that our caretakers are officially enrolled. We have the privilege of 28 million patient encounters every year, is this 28 million patient encounters generate a lot of data, that is directly seen [indiscernible] into the security of individual patient getting the power slice opportunities for precision medicine. But, they also keep forwarding to operate, used to give us insight into 40 minutes of business plan. Therefore, we have work going on right now, to protect them in the emergency room and improve their matching's or outstand of the intra newly better cure and better efficiency. You know, in efficiency we also happen to have unstructured data, we just matter in line which processing them all. So, automatically our cancer patients navigation, 306 cancer navigators used to spend 70% of the time finding patients, they now spend 70% of them in taking care of patients which helps in number [indiscernible] or we've been entitled to provide the care that improves the efficiency and some materialization in our system as we meet their need. Previously stated, feeding the operational networks and that's what this provided time on evaluator; it now allows us to increase our effective capacity, I haven't still why it is still not going up for, it's really got to create a virtually cycle learning and improving. Thanks for the question.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey good morning guys, first question on capital deployment, I think in back 2015 we talked about an annual CapEx program that answers itself? So, how are you thinking about sustaining that or pushing that to 2018, especially given the growth outgrow that you guys played out. Is it something that you expect to contained and just stay that level, or we're re-shifting the capital focus to exact positions to plug the growth from what seems to be a slowing organic outlook?
Samuel Hazen: I want to say the thing what I add on bill. Well our CapEx expenditure program, we have been setting it up at approximate $3 billion this year. I would expect for the year- end for 2018, it will continue at the low volume and move on, obviously some of the acquisitions that we made will have some capital investment there, on top of our base of hospitals and markets that we have. So, and after may look beyond 2018, we do have more flexible floating in our capital budget as far as commitments so, we are judged that as we go through the coming months in quarters, as in the proper amount of investment, but we will continue to make investments. As you know, our growth story is largely banked on organic growth story and again as I mentioned we are in great markets with population growth and we expect demand, so I think you'll continue to see us invest, but beyond next year, we'll wait and see, but we do that more flexibly with respect to capital.
Operator: We will go next to Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein.
Lance Wilkes: Yeah, good morning just wanted to know what your outlook was for 2018 commercial managed care rate increases compared to 2017 and then kind of related to that what are you seeing as far as neuro network strategies and you are taking risk in those kind of commercial managed cares were to patients.
Samuel Hazen: At this particular point in time the company is about 80% contracted for 2018, 75% to 80%. And almost identical term is to 2017 so all round 4% on our pricing trends with our commercial book of business and where about 35% to 40% into 2019 and about the same number. It was starting to pay say a little bit differently because we think there are certain reasons to the above business we are. So we can expect about 2019 and 2020 with respect to the need for some pricing adjustments possibly. But as it relates to neuro networks in risk taking, I would say I general not a lot has changed. We are not seeing significant neuro network development outside of the exchanges where we have been operating inside of that model. Ourselves as, as some of our competitors. Clearly there are evolving models in certain markets at different levels around accountable cure organizations and other models such as that we have a number of those within our portfolio of offerings with pairs in such so there is not broad based movement though on those fronts on the commercial book of business. I would say on the Medicare advantage side equation, there tends to be more deeper penetration of those type of things in the areas on the commercial side. So we are not seeing any significant movement though across the company that would suggest a major structural change in the near term possibly in the intermediate term in some markets but again not across 42 different markets.
Lance Wilkes: Great thank.
Operator: We will go next to Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo: Hi, thanks. Bill, back to the comment on years nurses turnover, I am just may be curios entering 2018 what is with these neuro initiatives resources or strategies you have around your programs I think a couple of years ago you were pretty successful on boarding physicians early into the organization I think like you kind of perhaps maybe you are offering something larger, a larger focus on something for the company so just maybe any comments just the nurse programs.
Samuel Hazen: So Whit it is the same, let me take this. We are really pleased with where we are with our initiatives around nursing in general and specifically around nursing turnover as Bill indicated, we are - we have improved our nursing turnover in about 15 months, 18 months by 200 basis points. Our nursing contract labor for the quarter, the spend on nursing contract labor not our components of contract labor in the company was actually day on in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. So we are very encouraged by that trend. We think we still have head room in a number of retention initiatives that will drive that metric down even further. I will tell you, we just checked off a second innovation of our nursing strategy, Milton provided an idea for the whole company. We have a very robust nursing agenda that we believe is going to ultimately differentiate HCA further from a nursing stand point. At our core the company is a nursing company. We provide nursing care in ERs, in the ORs on the floors in our cardiac CAT lab, whatever the case maybe. And we are seeing and finding ways to leverage what are called the HCA way to weight improve nursing. Part of that is creating organizational capacity for improvement, part of that is standardizing technology on the floors so that our nurses can spend more time in the bed - by the bedside with our patients. And an example of this we acquired the company a few years ago that had some unique technology that allows us to communicate within our nursing environment more effective with our patients [ph] more effectively with physicians and so forth. We have got one third of the way through rolling that particular technology up. And then I will tell you the last thing is really working with our nurse managers and our nurses to deal with pain point that prevent them from being at successful as they want to be. We think this is all connected to on boarding, nurse residency programs and evolved in the company an ongoing clinical education which we believe will produce more component work force, more capable work force and more efficient work force generating better patient outcomes clearly greater position in components as Milton indicated a moment ago we ultimately think driving more volume. So our nursing initiative is being resourced very comprehensively and we think there is a lot of opportunities for our improvements in what we are doing inside of our facilities.
Whit Mayo: Well, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.
Matthew Borsch: Yeah, those - hoping maybe we just talk I know your pointing to a number of the long term growth drivers can we think about the demographic shift, how do you think about the positive impact clearly from that aging trend which is very strong versus the offset of the mix shift from I am sorry to lower Medicare reimbursement?
Victor Campbell: All right, anybody to take a swing at that?
Samuel Hazen: Well, Mat, [indiscernible] in this trend of demographic change and its coupled with higher utilization, but let me talked about we have seen some changes between governmental and commercial mix. I don't think that were projecting that to be materially different in terms of year-over-year trend in what we have seen and so we have got strategies around the managed care and commercial side to trying to manage through that as well as just a overall effort to gain commercial markets shares. So it kind of offsets that under pending migration yeah, from commercial to governmental affairs.
Matthew Borsch: No, I just kind of asking you said - you are still in that positive when you factor that all in - in terms of the one hand the '18 trend on the other hand that Medicare pace left?
Samuel Hazen: We clearly as utilization grows as people aids through those continuing such going to generate more of the imports. So we can continue to - as we continue to see that trend, I think we will be in positive. The one thing that I think is important is it is when you look at our markets, our forecast for commercial demand, not just overall demand, the overall demand is being stocked if you will by the aging baby rumours and a few other components but the commercial demand side equation at least rates A markets we believe, it's still going to grow also and it won't grow with that composite number, but we believe it will grow somewhere 3.5 a point and point and so if we can maintain market share or grow market share inside of that overall demand picture then that obviously compensates for some of the margin dilution if you will that comes from a Medicare patients which is obviously less profitable than a commercial patient. So that's how we think it about, we have to ultimately grow or maintain our market share on the commercial side to make them all work.
Matthew Borsch: Thank you.
Samuel Hazen: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.
Ana Gupte: Yeah, thanks good morning. On the 2% admissions growth normalize, how do you think about the mix of things to angulatory and moves out the hospital deals with urgent care. I heard you tonight as saying that they can get 50% lower bed utilization in their optimum care markets and they stay of a 90% of AD visit possible in urgent care and is that trends slowing down or is it accelerating or how is that factoring into 2%.
Samuel Hazen: Let me give this a same - let me give you a couple of metrics to you for the quarter and this is pretty consistent for the year. Our lower acuity levels in our emergency rooms has declined 3%. Our upper level acuity visits - upper three levels has grown 3.8% so it actually seeing more growth from the high end then we have we obviously we had declines in the low ends. Our pricing in our emergency room tends to be stepped up based upon that and so from that stand point we are growing our higher priced emergency room visits. We are seeing declines in some areas on the lower, so the revenue production coming out our emergency room is still very, very strong. To suggest at 90% if I heard it correctly emergency room visits can be put into urgent care, there is no way that can happen. It is not possible, there is too much acute activity on the emergency room side for that to occur. We have urgent care centers developing across the HCA as a platform as well as an extension of our network I think we are up to almost a 100 urgent care centres in a very complimentary to our overall networking position and we do think for certain patients and in certain situations it is the better center and a better setting for care than the emergency room obviously, but they are very complimentary and they are very important to the market place, they are very important to the market place, they are very important to the network and they are very important to the payers in having access to a broader way of facility both in urgent care and emergency services. So that trend has so stabilized I would say, there is not much difference over the last few quarters and where that has gone within our emergency room and what the trends have done. We won't just have to see how that place up from one market to the other, there are differences in some markets. You are right there could be some differences in how that places are, but broadly across the company those are big trends.
Ana Gupte: Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank.
Chris Rigg: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to come back to the same facility on insured admissions increases, seems like it worsened a little bit on sequentially in the quarter. Are you guys trying to say that most of that or all of that is explained by declining ACA volumes and if not, what are the dynamics are in play at this point? Thanks.
William Rutherford: Yeah, this is Bill. So we reported 6.4% in the quarter, I think we run in 5.7% year-to-date, so it's jumped on us a little bit but I really don't judge that to be a materially jam as we - went into 2017 if we could to keep uninsured volume in that made to high single digits that's kind of what we anticipated as we have stated before 70% of our uninsured volumes in Texas and Florida. We are correlating that to the drop in the health insurance exchange. I think that is kind of the underlying number that we are seeing at a 6% level, 6.5% I think that's within a historical range that we expect, remind you that the impact of the growing uninsured is available cost to solve that and at mid-single digit level, I think that's within the confines of overall expectations and guidance.
Victor Campbell: Thank, you Chris. One last question.
Operator: We will go then to Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.
Sarah James: Hi, thanks for putting me in. Can you give us some context around where HCA sets now in some of these shifting markets? So how much of your current inpatient admissions or revenue is related to the procedures, the philosophy done in outpatient and think for ER, how much of the ER revenue or admissions is currently in low acuity?
Samuel Hazen: On the ER question, about 45% to 48% of our ER businesses are low acuity and obviously the balance of that is in the upper 3 acuity levels, so little bit more on the upper side than the lower side. To suggest that our inpatients procedures that ought to be done as outpatients, I don't see that as a case at all. I mean there is all kinds of protocols from a governmental stand point as well from a commercial pay roll stand point around approving procedures that are done in the inpatient setting and or the outpatient setting. So that's really not a phenomenon and that I think is out of source, I will tell there is always movement from inpatients to outpatients. That's inner trend, it's been there for a decade up or so, but there are also new technologies that are driving inpatient activity. We have seen that vascular care in other aspects of different service lines. So there always it's in out that goes inside of these two components of our business, but we aren't seeing any unique trans from inpatient to orthopedic services, but they are not anything that's so substantial that's going to disrupt the revenue stream on the inpatient or overly accelerate the revenue stream of the out patients at least in our judgment.
Victor Campbell: All right, Sarah, thank you. I want to just thank everyone for being on the call. Have any further questions feel free to give Mark a call. Thank you so much.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, Shannon. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I'd like to welcome everyone to the call today, also welcome all of you that are listening to the webcast. With me here this morning are Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Rutherford, Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Milt, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. excluding losses, gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, and legal claims costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the second quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded. A replay will be available later today. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or webcast today. I'll make a few comments on the quarter, and our updated guidance, and our recent M&A activity, and then I'll ask Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the second quarter results. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in the second quarter and the first half of 2017. Although, we are on plan for the second quarter, it's slightly off from our internal plan for adjusted EBITDA at midyear. Our results in the first half have been challenged by, one, softer managed and exchange volumes, and, two, our London market results have been negatively impacted by currency conversion rates and lower admissions from Middle East embassies and private insurance. Sam will provide additional detail on the London market later on the call. Our operating and corporate teams have executed well in managing expenses in the first half of this year. We continue to invest in our key strategic initiatives that will contribute to improving future clinical, operational, and financial performance. As Bill will highlight in a moment, our balance sheet and cash flow gives us the financial flexibility to invest in our existing markets to acquire new hospitals and to continue to execute our share repurchase plan. I will provide an update on recent acquisition activities later in my comments, but we are pleased to be able to expand our networks across several markets. Now turning to the second quarter, revenues for the second quarter increased 4% to $10.7 billion. Net income attributable to HCA Healthcare totaled $657 million or $1.75 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of total $2.09 billion, in line with our expectations. As noted in our release, the tax benefit from equity award settlements was $9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share in the second quarter compared to last year's tax benefit of $44 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Volume growth trend remains materially consistent with recent trends, with same-facility admissions increasing 0.8% and equivalent admissions increasing 1.3% over the prior year. This represents the 13th consecutive quarter of equivalent admission growth for HCA. On payer mix, for domestic operations are same-facility Medicare admissions comprise 46.8% of the company's overall admissions, while our same-facility managed care and exchange admissions were 27.7% of total domestic admissions compared to the 46.3% and 28.3% respectively in the prior year's second quarter. Based upon our results through six months of the year, we have updated and narrowed our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share for 2017. We currently estimate that adjusted EBITDA will now range from $8.35 billion to $8.5 billion and earnings per share will now range from $7.00 to $7.30 per diluted share for the year. Part of the EPS change is due to reducing the estimated tax benefit from recording of employee equity award settlements from our original estimate of $0.40 per diluted share for the year to our updated $0.27. Cash flow from operations remained strong for the company in the quarter, totaling $1.404 billion, compared to $1.349 billion in last year's second quarter. Our days in AR improved to 49 days compared to 50 days at year end 2016. We have remained active with share repurchase in the quarter. We repurchased 6.4 million shares during the quarter at a cost of $542 million. Year to date, the company repurchased 11.5 shares at a cost of $966 million, and at June 30, 2017, we had $887 million remaining under the existing repurchase authorization. Now, let me provide an update on the recent acquisition activities. On July 10, we announced an agreement to acquire Weatherford Regional Medical Center, a 103-bed hospital about 30 miles west of Fort Worth, and acquired it from Community Health Systems. Weatherford Regional will join our 13 hospitals and 7,000 active physicians in our HCA Medical City Healthcare network. We would expect this transaction to close during the fall of this year. Effective July 1, 2017, we completed the transaction to acquire two Texas hospitals from Community Health, and we expect to close on the previously announced Tenet Houston Hospitals by the end of this month. We continue to be on track to close the previously announced Memorial Health System in Savannah, Georgia by year end. And lastly, on July 21, we announced an agreement to acquire Highlands Regional Medical Center, a 126-bed acute care hospital in Sebring, Florida, from Community Health Systems. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and our health reform trends in the second quarter. As we reported in the second quarter, our same-facility admissions increased 0.8% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 1.3%. Sam will provide more commentary on the drivers of the volume in a moment, and I'll give you some trends by payer class. During the second quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2% and 3%, respectively, compared to the prior year period. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 5.1% on a same-facility basis compared to the prior-year period and represent 34.5% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.1% and 1.6%, respectively, in the quarter compared to the prior-year period, fairly consistent with the recent trends. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 4.9% in the quarter. This represents 7.8% of our total admissions compared to 7.5% in the second quarter of last year. Managed care and other, including exchange admissions, declined 1.3%, while equivalent admissions were flat on a same-facility basis in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 0.4% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and same-facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 19.5% of our total ER visits in the quarter, consistent with the second quarter of last year. Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same-facility case mix increasing 3.2% compared to the prior year period. Same-facility inpatient surgeries were flat to prior year and outpatient surgeries declined 1.2% from the previous year. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2% over the prior year for the quarter. And as Milton indicated, international operations adversely affected our results. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission for our U.S. domestic operations increased 2.6% over the prior year for the quarter. Our same-facility managed care other and exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.9% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $422 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care totaled $1.172 billion in the quarter, an increase of $74 million, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.463 billion, an increase of $348 million over the prior year period. Now turning to expenses, our expense management remained strong in the quarter. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.7% compared to last year's second quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.5% for the quarter as compared to 19.9% in the second quarter of last year. Sequentially, it increased 60 basis points from 18.9% in the first quarter of this year. Same-facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.2% compared to the last year's second quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue increased 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2016. Same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 2.4% for the second quarter compared to the prior year. We did see a growth in medical device spend similar to what we saw in the first quarter due to volume growth for some high acuity procedures. Supply expense as a percent of revenue improved 20 basis points sequentially from the first quarter. Other operating expenses as a percent of revenue increased 30 basis points from last year's second quarter to 18.3% of revenues, primarily reflecting an increase in year-over-year contract services and professional fees that we discussed on our first quarter call. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Cash flows from operations totaled $1.404 billion. Year to date, cash flows from operations were $2.684 billion and free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and distributions to non-controlling interests, was $1.132 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $3.8 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. This is higher than we typically carry in anticipation of closing three facility acquisitions in Houston on July 31. We did complete several financing transactions during the quarter, including extending and increasing our revolver capacity and closing on a $1.5 billion, 5.5% senior secured note with a 30-year term, which we plan to use for acquisitions, and we redeemed some 2018 near-term maturities. This was an important transaction for the company as it represents the first time in 14 years that we've issued a bond with a term greater than 10 years. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.83 times at June 30, 2017, compared to 3.82 times at December 31 of 2016. Our strong cash flow, balance sheet position and EPS growth continue to highlight an important strength of the company. Let me speak briefly on our health reform activity. In the second quarter, we saw approximately 12,800 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 13,400 we saw in the second quarter of last year for a decline of 4.2% year-over-year. But it did reflect a 7.5% growth sequentially from the first quarter. We saw approximately 52,400 same facility exchange ER visits in the second quarter compared to the 54,800 in the second quarter of 2016 and 49,800 in the first quarter of 2017, or a 5.3% growth sequential. So overall, these reform trends are tracking with the enrollment activity in our markets and generally in line with our expectations. So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Good morning. Let me provide some more detail on our volume trends for the quarter. On a same-facility basis for our domestic operations as compared to the second quarter last year, 8 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions. Growth was particularly strong in our North Florida, Tennessee, and Continental divisions. And conversely, our Houston and South Florida divisions were weak. All other divisions were slightly up or slightly down. 10 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions. Six of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 13%, while hospital-based emergency visits declined 0.9%. Once again, most of this decline was seen in lower acuity visits. Admissions through the emergency room grew by 1.2%. Trauma and EMS volumes grew by 13% and 1.4% respectively. Inpatient surgeries grew 0.6%. Surgical admissions were 30% of total admissions in the quarter, which is essentially flat with prior year. Surgical volumes were particularly strong in cardiovascular, orthopedic and neuroscience service lines. Nine of 14 divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Outpatient surgeries were down 0.9%. Volumes were down in both our hospital base and freestanding ambulatory surgery centers. Seven of 14 divisions were up in this service line. Behavioral health admissions grew 2.6%. Rehab admissions grew 7%. Cardiology volumes grew 7.4%. Births were down 3.1% and neonatal admissions were essentially flat. In summary, our volumes were generally consistent with the first quarter. As Bill referenced, we did see a slight improvement in our managed care and exchange volumes this quarter, with adjusted admissions in these payer classes flat year-over-year. As I stated in my comments last quarter, we believe commercial demand has been soft over the last four or five quarters, which we believe explains most of our softer volumes. On a positive note, we have seen our commercial market share rebound some in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 on a sequential basis. Now let me transition to our operations in London. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter for this market was down 30% in local currency and 35% in dollars, or approximately $25 million. This decline depressed the company's adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter. The second quarter was particularly weak because of a significant decline in admissions, which were down 7.4%, and surgeries, which were down by 11.3%. There were two factors that drove this weakness. First, admissions from the Middle East, which is an important part of our business, were down 33% in the quarter. This business has been trending down over the past year, but was down even more in the quarter. Additionally, admissions in our medical insurance segment were down 10%. These declines were partially offset by our private pay admissions, which grew by 13%. We believe our team is making the appropriate adjustments to our growth strategy and cost structure to respond to these trends. Operating margins in this market were still strong, and we believe London is a good market for the company. Overall, we continue to refine and enhance our efforts to improve our business and grow our business. We believe these refinements and enhancements will deliver value for our patients and physicians, allow us to compete more effectively in a dynamic marketplace, and ultimately sustain growth. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, Sam, thank you. Shannon, if you could come back on and we'd like to start the question and answer process and I'd encourage each of you who ask question, limit it to one so we can give everyone an opportunity.
Operator: Yes, sir. Thank you. We first move to Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just first on the guidance, perhaps this is an overly simplistic view, but historically HCA has earned around 25% of their full-year EBITDA in the second quarter, which implies a run rate that's slightly below $8.4 billion for the full year. So, what areas of improvement are you seeing that gives you confidence that the underlying trends improve in the second half of the year?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, Milton, Bill, how do you want to take that?
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I'll take a shot, and then Bill can come in. Whit, as you think about our projections for the rest of the year, so let's talk about the first half and how we think that relates to our expectations in the second half. So as I said in my comments, and Bill mentioned, we're on our plan for the second quarter, so the $2.09 billion that we reported in adjusted EBITDA is on plan with our second quarter. We were about, for the mid-year, about 1% off of where we thought our plan would be. And so as we look at the second half, our comps do get easier. As we think about the volume comps and some of the revenue comps, they do ease in the second half. We think that we can continue to see solid expectations around 4% or so on revenue growth. And that if we hit our targets, we think we can come in pretty much, I think, around the middle of the range that we stated, our revised range. So, we have confidence in that. Obviously, our expense management, we've taken some action there. We think those will continue to yield benefits in the second half of the year. Again, as I've said in my comments, I'm very pleased with our expense management in the first half, but we have made some adjustments going into the second half, and I think that will help us as well.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: And Whit, this is Bill. The only thing I'd add, we did some change in the currency conversion of our London operations in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year as that begins to sunset itself. So that's an improving trend as well.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Whit.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thanks. I guess if you could do a little more color on – because I guess the guidance, you're reaffirming the revenue target, but you're taking down the EBITDA target. Can you just give a little bit more color about what exactly the pressure is versus the original guidance as far as cost, or there's something around payer mix that's causing that to come down?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Bill, you?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, I kind of look at it – we lowered the – lowering of our EBITDA range by $50 million. It's a relatively smaller amount. The revenue range, we're on plan with our revenue, as Milton said here today. So, we feel comfortable to come still within that range. So there's nothing other specific that I would call out.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, so what we're doing with our guidance is obviously we tightened it on the high end. The implied growth rate that we would have to have to achieve the high end of range is probably close to 10% second half of the year. So we took that off the table and tried to – and as we usually do mid-year, we tightened our range. And so as Bill said, we did drop the low end by $50 million. We think that's reflective of our first half performance, where as I said, we're off our plan by about 1%. And so that's reflective, really, of that expectation. But if we can perform on our plan for the second half of the year like we have here in the second quarter, then we should be well within our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA that we stated this morning.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin.
Operator: Next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks. Just can I get a quick numbers question first? In your updated guidance, does it include the deals that have already closed, like Tenet, or it includes no deals whatsoever closed in it?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Justin, this is Bill. It doesn't include any acquisitions completed to date. We typically wouldn't include acquisitions that are not yet completed. The ones we've completed to date are relatively smaller revenue, roughly $150 million to $170 million. So we've got room within our revenue range for that, but just in case the guidance claims from how we originally presented it, it doesn't include any acquisitions, and there's really nominal, if any, EBITDA impact of acquisitions.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: And we're looking, obviously, for some revenue contribution in the second half, but immaterial EBITDA.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Correct.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Got it. And then...
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Justin, did you...
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Sorry.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Go ahead.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks, guys. The question was just around, Sam, you went through some of those market share numbers pretty quick. I heard you say that commercial actually is starting to stabilize/improve. But can you give us some more color there, especially around or including the $4 billion that you talked about of in-flight capital and how you see that trending for the back half of the year, in your mind? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Sam, you?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: So, let me give you an overview on our market share for 2016, which is the last period that we have. Overall, our market share is modestly down, like down 8 basis points. Last year it was roughly 25%. It's about 24.92% or so, thereabout. So it's modestly down. The market as a whole, all of HCA's markets grew by roughly 2% with a slight tilt down in the last half of the year, just slightly below the 2%. On the commercial side, the commercial demand in HCA's markets grew by 1% in 2016. Again, a little bit tilted more toward the first half of last year, but still growing even in the second half of last year, and that's where we started to see some rebound both really in overall share and commercial share. So if you look at our market share, and I like to look at it on a sequential basis because it tells me more timely what's happening in the marketplace, is we've started to see both our overall share rebound, to the point where we're 25.07% in the fourth quarter, so we're actually starting to see some recovery. And then we're up a little bit also on our commercial at 22.1%, so we're seeing a recovery sequentially in our market share. We do have a couple of pockets of markets where we have some pressures. I highlighted some of those in our comments. But overall, I think we're seeing a stabilization and a slight rebound in our market share positioning across the company.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Justin.
Operator: Next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.
Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Can you give us more color on the managed and exchange volumes? Was it more on the exchange side or the non-exchange market? And to what degree do you view these as short-term factors impacting admissions versus more of a thematic or a long-term pressure?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, I'll start with the exchange volumes. So as we mentioned, we're down about 4% on a year-over-year basis. And that tracks by all data that we have with the enrollments in our marketplace. And it's sequentially up 7%. And so that did have an impact in terms of the overall managed and other books. Over the past couple of years, as you know, we've been seeing exchange volume growth, especially in the first half of the year as it tends to ramp coming out of the first and second quarter, where we're seeing 15% to 20% growth in exchange. This year we're seeing a slight decline. Realize exchanges are less than 3% of our total, but that change in growth trends did impact the overall managed care book, but to a relatively smaller amount.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, and let me just add to that, Bill. This is Sam. I think last quarter we indicated that we were having to re-position some of our contracts in Texas because the lives wound up landing in certain payers where we did not have relationships. Over the last three or four months, we've been able to improve our position in that particular market, and I'm encouraged by the amount of contracting we've been able to do. So as we move forward, I think we should be in a better position, depending upon, obviously, the population of lives within the exchange. But nonetheless, our overall contracting position and participation in payer contracts in the exchange in Texas have improved.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, and this is Milt. Just on your question about short-term versus long-term, we're seeing some sequential improving trends in our managed care adjusted admissions. We reported we were down 1.9% in the first quarter of this year. Now that does include we're comping to leap year last year, and some impact of that would be leap year. But we're flat with managed care and other on the second quarter. So sequentially, the trends are improving, and we hope that we can continue to leverage off this. But – so it's hard to call right now into the long-term effect here, but when we look at the overall health insurance – employer health insurance marketplace, it continues to be in very good shape. And with respect to the number of covered lives, so that gives me some optimism about the future, and if we can execute our growth strategies, especially our strategies focused around the commercial book, including putting more capital in place that was referenced earlier in the call, I'm optimistic that we can continue and go back to a growth trend with respect to our commercial book.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, Sarah, thank you very much.
Operator: Next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Hello, everybody. Thanks. I'm going to try to – I don't know. I can't say it's a two-part even question, but just two areas. Can you just comment a little more on what's going on with the self-pay? The uncompensated care and bad debt are jumping around, but it sounds like the self-insured volumes you're seeing are pretty much in line with what you thought, if not even maybe a little better this quarter. And then I was just going to ask also when your capital – you've stepped up the acquisition pace, but you also stepped up the buybacks, so that was encouraging to see sequentially. Can you sustain the buyback pace with the enhanced acquisition activity?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, A.J., just because you've been around for long, we'll let you do two different questions at once.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, A.J.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Bill, you want to take that?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, A.J., let me take the bad debts, and I'll talk about the share repurchase, too, and let Milton add on. So we know our bad debts are reading in terms of year-over-year a little elevated. And obviously, we talked about before, we think if you look at our total uncompensated care, which includes our bad debts, charity and uninsured, in any given quarter you are subject to some classification trends among these categories, but generally speaking, over time, our uncompensated care trends track with our uninsured volume trends. And as we mentioned, we're seeing roughly a 4% to 5% growth in uninsured admissions, 4.9% in the second quarter. That's a little higher than we ran in the last half of 2016 and first quarter, but as you mentioned, pretty much in line with our expectations in that low-single digit. On a dollar basis, we ran about 5.4% more uncompensated care in Q2 than we did in Q4 of 2016. And on adjusted net revenue basis, that's looking at uncompensated care as a percent of revenue, year to date we're running at 34% versus 33% in full year 2016. So, we realize that did trend up, but overall, the uncompensated care trends are tracking right with our uninsured volume trends. We remain really pleased with our revenue cycle collection efforts. Our collection results around deductibles and co-pays remain consistent. We don't see any deterioration in the deduct and co-pay part of the receivables. Our collections continue to keep pace. As Milton mentioned, our net days is 49. Cash as a percentage of revenue over 100%. So, it's pretty much in line with what our expectations are in terms of year-over-year basis when you are subject to some fluctuation on that. Regarding the capital deployment, as you know today, we are able to continue to complete our share repurchase authorization. We plan on completing that by the end of this year. And we can continue to complete the acquisition pipelines that we see in front of us. Just given the strength of our cash flow and the strength of the position of the balance sheet, we're able to do both of those strategies without any interference on that.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Not much to add other than to say, I think that the strength of our balance sheet, our cash flow distinguishes HCA, gives the ability to continue to invest approximately $3 billion of capital this year back in our existing markets to complete our share repurchase plan and to make some strategic acquisitions. So this is really in line with now our financial approach in terms of capital allocation, and we're very pleased to be able to supplement the acquisitions through our strategy this year.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. Thank you, A.J.
Operator: Next question comes from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Thanks very much. I must confess, first of all, on the cash flow side, there's no question. It's copious. You're applying it brilliantly. I get that. But I have to come back to this managed care number because I'm actually quite confused. And it's really a big important factor in your leadership and your margins, and all the rest of that. So forgive me if I beat this dead horse. I thought you said that your managed care admissions same-store year-over-year were down 1.3%. And then, I thought I heard Milt say that it was flat. So...
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: No, Sheryl, it was adjusted admissions flat in the managed care and exchange book for the second quarter. Admissions only, down 1.3%. So that's the distinction between the two numbers.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay, good. So I get that. If we can focus on the inpatient for a minute and try to parse this number out, and I'll just ask the question very simply. Are the troubles you're having with managed care admissions, because they're down, directly and only related to what you're seeing in the exchanges, or is there non-exchange impact there as well?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Sam, do you want to...
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I think it's a little of both. It's more pronounced inside of the exchanges than it is the commercial. I think one thing that's really relevant here is obstetrics on the commercial side is roughly, I don't know, 20% of overall commercial demand, give or take a few points. And with commercial obstetrics volume being down 2.5% to 3%, it weighs out to be 0.6%, so it explains half of our decline. And then, when you layer on some of the kicks, declines in enrollment, it gets us closer to what's happening in the market. So I think from that standpoint, that's how I would color it. Obviously, we've seen some softening in our low acuity emergency room business. Again, as I mentioned in our first quarter call last April that we are seeing some competition in that space with urgent care, some freestanding emergency rooms that have evolved in certain markets, and that puts some pressure on the lower acuity side of the business. But our upper level acuity is actually growing in our emergency room. And I think that's indicative of the kind of programs we've added through stroke programs, comprehensive stroke centers, trauma, and the like. And so we're seeing those dynamics, and that's having a little bit of an effect as well on our admission rates.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Can I just follow-up on that?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Okay, go ahead.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: I appreciate that, because that's really interesting. So, the low acuity cases, which I'm sure you're not sorry to not have, not being there, is that what's driving the higher percentage admission of cases in the ER?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, yes, that's sort of mathematical in that. Obviously, we get more admission rate on the higher acuity patients. So as a percentage of our total ER business, if in fact that's the component that's growing, we're going to see a higher admission rate. And our ER admission rate, like I said, in total was up 1.2%. I don't have the exact commercial admission rate. It's slightly up, if I remember correctly, from like 12.6% to 12.8% on the commercial side, indicative, again, of the higher acuity components of our ER business. And let me say this, we clearly want the lower acuity business somewhere in our system. That's why we're investing heavily in urgent care, and we continue to invest in freestanding emergency rooms, because it allows us to develop a relationship with our patients and ultimately integrate them inside the HCA system. So we still have a very significant investment strategy and development strategy around urgent care, freestanding emergency rooms, other outpatient centers that start to introduce our systems to patients in commercial markets. So I'm encouraged by what we're doing there, and we have a lot of capital in the pipeline in those areas, and I think it's going to position us well in these markets as we move forward.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, Sheryl, thank you.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning guys. Milton, just a question on acquisitions. You alluded to a good pipeline there. So as we see organic volumes moderate, just like what Sam was discussing, I mean, is this a proactive strategy to bolster volumes, or is this more opportunistic as you have done nine acquisitions so far? And also, are you willing to go into new markets if that opportunity arises, or is it all in-market tuck-ins?
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Brian, thanks for the question. First of all, it's a mix as far as tuck-in acquisitions. Some of the acquisitions we've announced have been smaller hospitals that complement our existing markets, and Houston is a great example, one in south Texas, it'll complement our San Antonio market. We have, of course, announced Savannah, which would be a new market for HCA. We were very pleased with that opportunity to acquire that facility. And that, again, is example of maybe – I think it's the first significant new market we've had a chance to enter into since probably 2003. So yeah, it's a combination of both. And we're seeing the strategy – number one, it's something that we have been pursuing. We're seeing more opportunities in the marketplace now. I think as many health systems, again, went through the positive environment from 2015 and early 2016, and now we're seeing some volume pressures. We're looking, I think, to be part of the bigger system. And so we are encouraged by that. We think we have a lot to offer as far as opportunity for many of these systems. So it is opportunistic, but it is also consistent with our strategy. So, we're pleased to see the pipeline more robust than it has been in recent years. These transactions, we'll see if we can continue to get these to closure, but we are excited about the acquisitions, and we think it can be complementary to our growth story. As you know, over the past decade plus, HCA has been primarily an organic growth company. It tells of the richness and the depth of our markets and the population growth of many of our markets. And we continue to see that opportunity, but certainly, these acquisitions can complement that. And we are encouraged and excited about the opportunity.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Brian, thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. I'm wondering if you can touch on the decline in the operation surgery cases in the quarter year-over-year, and maybe touch on your view on whether that's more competitive related, or whether you're seeing just some general industry softness there.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, Scott, thank you. Sam, do you want that?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: That's a good question. As far as outpatient surgery, we have had a few quarters now where we've been flat to slightly down or slightly up, but not anywhere where we want to be. That was a little more difficult for us to draw definitive conclusions around simply because we don't get as much good data. So it's more anecdotal than it is empirical. I would say, though, our instincts are and our intuition around the marketplace is there has been general softening, number one. Number two, there's a lot of competition in outpatient surgery space because it's lower capital, and in many markets, there's no certificate of need. So there have been a few competitive dynamics in the market here or there. But we're pretty opportunistic with our approach to our outpatient surgery. We have a multi-venue offering both in the hospital and outside of the hospitals in our ambulatory surgery center division. We continue to add units to our ambulatory surgery center division through acquisitions and new development, in addition to bringing more physicians into our partnerships inside of those ambulatory surgery centers. So I'm encouraged by what our teams are doing to try to recover and grow in this particular segment. I do think the softening in the emergency room has a trickle-down effect on outpatient surgeries. Typically, we will see outpatient surgery activity from emergency room traffic 90 days to 120 days out. And because our emergency room business has softened somewhat, we think that's having an influence over our outpatient surgery. But nonetheless, we have a very aggressive effort at working with our physicians, investing in equipment, investing in facilities when we need to improve our overall position and sustain growth in this area.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Scott, thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. I was hoping I could get some more color as to what's going on in London. I mean a 30% to 35% decline in EBITDA seems pretty remarkable, and does seem like it could move the needle at least within the EBITDA guidance range. I mean, what's – particularly on the Middle Eastern side? I'm just having a – would love to get a better sense for what you guys think is driving that pressure and (42:31)
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, Chris, thanks. Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, this is Sam. I just actually got back from London a couple of weeks ago. I was visiting with our team for most of the week. And over the past few quarters, we have seen softening in our Middle East embassy business in London. I think a couple of drivers. One is we believe there's competition for the Middle East business because it's a productive payer for us and for others. So there's competition in Germany, Singapore, and even in the United States for Middle East business, and so there's that factor that probably intensified over the past few years having some impact. Our intuition, again, is that with some of the difficulties in the energy economy, that's slowing the trends down on out-migrations from in-country healthcare to other countries. That's a piece of it. So that's having an influence as well. But all in all, our London operations continue to operate around a 20% local currency margin. It did in fact impact our growth rate this past quarter by a decent amount for a small division, if you will, and that's why we called it out. As Bill alluded to, we anniversaried some of those issues in the second quarter, and we believe in the last half of the year some of those anniversaried issues will start to normalize and not produce the impact that it did in the quarter. The second quarter by itself was a very difficult quarter for us in London. I do think we're in the midst of repositioning our facilities, our network, our capabilities in London, and somewhat changing our business model to be less reliant on Middle East business and more reliant on local business, self-pay business, and some of the struggles that exist in the NHS system over there with waste and physician dissatisfaction and so forth. So we're investing in outpatient facilities, urgent care facilities, imaging facilities, working with our physicians on physician clinics and so forth to replicate aspects of what we're doing in the U.S. to build out a very user friendly, efficient facility complement in London. And I'm very encouraged by what our teams are doing and how they're working through this transition. We've made some significant cost structure adjustments. We're leveraging learnings in our cost structure over here more effectively over there. So I'm anticipating a recovery over the next 12 months to 18 months in our London operations that will put us on a different trajectory.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, thanks, Sam. Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.
Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Just want to go to guidance; midpoint suggests EBITDA growth of 2.5%. And when I look back to last year, EBITDA grew a little bit under 4%. Just wanted to see if you can help with sort of the context of the 4% to 6% long-term EBITDA growth. Is that sort of still fair, particularly with the consensus kind of sitting in that 5% EBITDA growth for 2018? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, Ralph. Bill, do you want...
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, with the long term 4% to 6%, I mean, there's going to be years where that's going to be challenged. We're feeling that here at the midpoint of this year. But when I think about it, again, it is long-term guidance. When I look back over the last five years, I think our EBITDA, our growth CAGR is just under 6%. So I know we had to push there from health reform with that. But when we break that out, probably no more than a third of our growth in that period came from reform, and two-third came from the core business. So, we feel like on a long-term basis, that that's still a reasonable range for prior performance.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Ralph.
Operator: Next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. A question for Bill. I just want to go back to the bad debt expense for a moment. Of that $1.73 billion this quarter, what percentage of that is co-pay deductible reserving? And I'm just trying to understand how that number can be up 41% year-over-year and sequentially if the collectability is unchanged, is all of that just reclassification?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, thanks, Gary.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, Gary, so historically of our own compensated care, two-thirds is coming from the uninsured population, a third coming from our insured through deductibles and Cos. And as I said, as we look at the deductibles and Cos, the trends that we're seeing there are remaining very consistent, and our cash collections are remaining very consistent. So we don't see any deterioration in that segment of the book that gives us a concern. Regarding the bad debts alone, you are subject from time-to-time, as we've seen in the past, with just some classifications between uninsured discounts, charity, and bad debts. Some of that's on time you know write offs versus the reserve for the provision. So that's why I think it's important you look at the total uncompensated care. To answer your overall question, we remain about a third of that's coming from deducts and Cos, and about two-thirds from the uninsured population.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, thanks, Gary.
Operator: Next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the volumes that you talked about for managed Medicare or Medicare Advantage, which shows quite a positive in your reports today. Is that uniform across all markets? You also talked about some markets like San Francisco and Houston being down, and I was wondering if that's got to do with capitated contracts with primary care docs? And is that likely to intensify, or is it leveling off and is more competitive?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: We didn't mention San Francisco. We said South Florida.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Sorry, South Florida, I meant. South Florida.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Sorry.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: I was going to say, we've got some assets I didn't know about. I thought I knew just about everything in HCA. So I think in South Florida, as I mentioned in a couple of calls ago, we still are seeing some pressure from our managed care providers in how they're classifying certain patients between observation and inpatient. And when I add the two together, we're actually up in South Florida. But unfortunately, for admissions, it doesn't count as an admission. We continue to work with our physicians and these managed care payers to make the right decisions on those status-ing, and we're improving that a little bit, but that's the driver in that particular market. In Houston; Houston, I don't know if you've seen it or not, but there's a lot of carnage in Houston with respect to system changes, leadership changes, and so forth. Houston is a difficult market because the economy has really suffered with oil prices and so forth. We've actually stabilized in Houston from a financial standpoint, but we have continued to see significant volume pressures, but it's been localized at a couple of our hospitals and not nearly as broad based as it was maybe a year or so ago. So that's the two markets that had the most pronounced weakness. As far as Medicare Advantage and Medicare business, that's generally consistent across the company. That's a natural phenomenon that's going on in the marketplace this year, just like it was going on last year. Our pricing continues to be very consistent between Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare. We do see some of these status-ing issues from one market to the other, but overall we are very positive about what's going on with our Medicare growth. Now, I'll tell you, our Medicare business growing at 2.5% to 3%, or whatever that number was, is part of why our margins are down. People are asserting that our costs are up. It's really because the composition of our business is lower profitability on Medicare than it is commercial. And so as it grows, it puts a little bit of pressure on our margins, and that's part of the challenge that we had so far this year. But as that starts to stabilize and we start to see some recovery hopefully in our commercial book, we can recover that and get our margins back to where we want them to be. But we have a lot of markets that are growing. As I mentioned, North Florida, Tennessee, and Continental had great quarters. A handful of our other divisions grew around 1% or so. And then, we had a few that were down around 0.5 point to 1 point. So still a solid performance across the portfolio, a solid performance across the different service lines, and just a continued pattern of incremental growth organically in a marketplace that's cooled down a little bit. And we think, again, that's somewhat cyclical.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Very helpful. Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: You're welcome. We've got time for one last question.
Operator: Next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. I'm going to try to apply for the A.J. waiver, see if I can (51:43). We did a quick calc of the revenue that you're acquiring. It looks like around $2.5 billion. Do you think you can, over time, get those margins to your company average? I mean, that's where the big EBITDA number, obviously.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: First of all, let me just clarify – this is Milton, John. Let me just clarify on the amount of revenue. Looking at the acquisitions that we have announced, including the hospitals that we've closed, and that would be Waycross and Tomball, and the South Texas facility from Community. And then, we've announced, of course, the three hospitals from Tenet in the Houston market, the recently announced Sebring, Weatherford, and Memorial Savannah. So if you look at the last 12 months' revenue on all those acquisitions, it would be about $1.5 billion – or probably $1.6 billion of incremental revenue annually, not $2.5 billion.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, and this is Sam. On the margin side, clearly, when we are acquiring facilities inside an existing market where we have infrastructure and capabilities to support those particular facilities with local infrastructure and then layer on the corporate infrastructure, we do see prospects for achieving end market margins. Now, our markets have different margins. Some margins are higher in one market or the other. So to say company average, I have to look at it more specifically around the individual markets. The Savannah operation, as Milton said, is a new market for us. It is a market-maker, as I mentioned on the last call, because of the certificate need offerings that it already has in the State of Georgia. We believe there's a lot of opportunity in that particular facility. It will take us longer to get it than it will hospitals that are in market, but we do believe over a four to five year period, we're going to be in a really good position financially with this particular investment and this particular hospital.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right, John, I guess we'll give you the A.J. waiver. What's your second?
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Just more of a strategic question. Consumer elasticity grows every year with high co-pay plans and deductibles. And it looks to me where you've got some exposure to lower cost competitors, such as ASC, physician-owned on ASC and maybe some of the alternatives to ER, your volume trends have been a little off as the ACA effect is waived. Do you look at that and say, maybe we need to layer in some more lower cost options versus just kind of the hospital-based higher cost?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Well, this is Sam again. I think it's important for everyone to understand, HCA has over 1,700 facilities providing care to our patients. We have 170 plus hospitals, which clearly are the largest component of our revenue, and the destination within our networks and our network system. But we are adding significantly to the number of outpatient facilities, urgent care, freestanding emergency room, ambulatory surgery, as I mentioned previously, physician clinics, breast centers, all of these different components that make it easier for the patient to access, create geography dispersion for our network, and put us in a situation where we can gain a relationship with a patient and hopefully keep them in the HCA system. So we're clearly doing that right now and investing in more as we look at some of this capital that's in our pipeline. So that is a part of what we're doing. Strategically, though, we still want to downstream this business into our facilities whenever this more acute care is needed. And so that's a fundamental piece of our strategy. It's a fundamental piece of our investments. And it's how we market ourselves, if you will, to the consumer in these large markets.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: Yeah, John, this is Milton, and I'll end with this. So, as Sam's saying, it's not that we're not investing. We're already investing in it. We see the strategy. I think what we're seeing in the marketplace is a lot of competition in that same space. I think that's what you may be referencing. It's a low capital entry point into healthcare and our market, so we're seeing more competition, but again, I think with HCA, with what Sam's describing and our overall network capability, that over time we'll see some of that rationalize. And so I think we're feeling some competitive pressure from these markets in those lower cost entry points, but I think over time our performance will continue to be very strong.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Healthcare, Inc.: All right. John, thank you very much. And I thank everyone. Hope you all have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the HCA first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Please note that today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Amelia, thank you. Good morning everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome everyone on today's call, and those of you listening on the webcast. With us here this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings Inc. excluding losses/gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the first quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay will be available later today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Morning, thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate your interest in HCA, and as you saw from our release this morning, our first quarter earnings results were consistent with the preview we issued on April 17. I'll make a few comments on the quarter and recent acquisition activity and then turn the call over to Bill and to Sam to provide more detail on the quarter. Revenues for the first quarter increased 3.5% to $10.6 billion. Net income totaled $659 million or $1.74 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA was $2.005 billion. While these results were modestly below our internal expectations, we remain optimistic about 2017, and as you saw in our release, we are maintaining our previously issued earnings guidance for full year 2017. During the first quarter, we achieved or exceeded our internal growth expectations for adjusted EBITDA over prior year for January and March. However, it was largely offset by February's underperformance as planned. Looking at volumes in the quarter, same-facility admissions increased 1.2% and equivalent admissions increased 1.6%. This represents the 12th consecutive quarter of equivalent admission growth for HCA. As we noticed in our preview, the quarter's results were impacted by unfavorable changes in payer mix and the loss of one day when compared to the first quarter of 2016. On the payer mix, our same-facility Medicare admissions comprised a larger percentage of the company's overall admissions at 48.1% compared to 47% last year, while our same-facility managed care and HIX admissions were 27.4% of admissions compared to 28.6% in the prior year's first quarter. Clearly, this had an unfavorable impact on our net revenue per adjusted admission in the quarter, and I'll let Bill and Sam address all of this in more detail in just a moment. Cash flows from operations were strong once again for this quarter, totaling approximately $1.3 billion compared to $1.4 billion last year. The current quarter's cash flow was negatively impacted by a $188 million settlement payment in the quarter related to a longstanding contractual dispute in our Kansas City market. Adjusting for this payment, cash flows from operations were up approximately 4.9% in the quarter compared to the prior year. We continue to see nice improvement in our working capital, with our days in AR now at 48 compared to 50 days in the fourth quarter of last year and 52 days a year ago. We continue to be quite active with our share repurchase program. The company repurchased 5.1 million shares in the first quarter at a cost of $424 million. We have a little over $1.4 billion, I should say, remaining on our $2 billion authorization as of March 31, 2017, and we had 368.7 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2017. We now have repurchased approximately 37.5% of the outstanding shares at the time of our IPO six years ago. Let me spend a moment on our recent acquisition activity. Yesterday, we announced the signing of definitive agreements to acquire three Houston area hospitals from Tenet and two Texas hospitals from Community Health Systems, one in Tomball on the north side of Houston, and one in Jourdanton, which is about 40 miles south of San Antonio. These facilities will strategically complement these markets and will enhance our ability to meet the medical needs and improve patient access to our provider networks in both communities. We expect these transactions to close sometime in the summer of 2017. In addition, we closed on a 231 – acute care hospital in Waycross, Georgia, that's also closed yesterday, which should complement our Jacksonville market. Also, last week, we announced the signing of a Letter of Intent to purchase Memorial Health in Savannah, Georgia, a not-for-profit acute care hospital with 604 beds. Memorial Health is the only provider in the market of Level 3 PICU and NICU services and Level 1 trauma services. This should significantly strengthen our position along the Atlantic Coast from Jacksonville to Charleston. We expect this acquisition to close by year end. These four transactions are expected to add seven hospitals with over 2,000 beds and approximately $1.5 billion in new annualized revenues to the company. We look forward to bringing HCA's complementary (07:06) capabilities and operational scale to these facilities. And I guess I would be remiss if I didn't say something this morning about all the national attention over the last three months to healthcare reform. While I'm not about to predict where all the repeal, replace and repair discussions will ultimately land, I want to assure you that we are actively engaged in discussions with policymakers in Washington and in our states. Most importantly, I'm confident HCA's long-term focus on putting the patient at the center of everything we do will serve us well no matter where these discussions may settle. And lastly, the HCA Board of Directors last week approved a change in the legal name of HCA Holdings to HCA Healthcare. The change will be effective May 8. Our new name is more reflective of our mission and the broad spectrum of care we provide to our communities and the dedication of our caregivers to our patients in our vast network of inpatient and outpatient facilities across our 42 U.S. markets and the UK. HCA Healthcare will continue to trade under the symbol HCA. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bill.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning everyone. I will give you some more detail on our performance and the results for the quarter. As we reported in the first quarter, our same-facility admissions increased 1.2% over the prior year. Same-facility equivalent admissions increased 1.6%. Sam will provide more color on the drivers of this volume in a moment, and I will give you some trends by payer class. During the first quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.5% and 4.3% respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 7.3% on a same-facility basis and represent 34.1% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.9% and 1.3% respectively in the quarter. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 3.2% in the quarter, while equivalent admissions increased 3.5%. These represent 7% of our total admissions compared to 6.9% last year. Texas and Florida still represent about 70% of our total uninsured admissions. Managed care other and exchange admissions declined 3.2%, and equivalent admissions declined 1.9% on a same-facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 1.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 18.7% of our total ER visits in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 18.6% in the prior year. Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter, with our same-facility case mix increasing 3% compared to the prior-year period. Same-facility surgeries were flat in the quarter, with same-facility inpatient surgeries increasing 0.9% and outpatient surgeries declining 0.5% from the prior year. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 1.7% in the quarter. Our international division negatively impacted this stat in the quarter, mostly due to currency conversion. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission for our U.S. domestic operations increased 2.3% over the prior year. Our same-facility managed care other and exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.4% in the quarter, in line with expectations. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $510 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Our same-facility charity care discounts totaled $1.086 billion in the quarter or an increase of $131 million from the prior-year period, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.475 billion, or an increase of $379 million over the prior-year period. Overall, our uncompensated care trends are tracking in line with expectations and consistent with our uninsured growth trends. Now turning to expenses, our same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.1% compared to last year's first quarter. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues was 46.1% compared to 45.8% in last year's first quarter. Our salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.8% in the quarter on a same-facility basis. Same-facility wage rates increased 2.3% in the quarter, and overall our labor trends remain stable. Supply expense as a percent of revenue was 16.9% this quarter as compared to 16.7% in last year's first quarter on a consolidated basis. Our same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 2.8% in the first quarter compared to the prior-year period. We did see a slight increase in medical device spend due to volume growth of some high-acuity procedures. Other operating expenses increased 10 basis points from last year's first quarter to 18.2% of revenues. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.28 billion, down slightly from the $1.399 billion in last year's first quarter. And as Milton mentioned, cash flow from operations was reduced by $188 million due to the Kansas City settlement that was paid in the first quarter. Cash from operations was benefited by continued strong performance in accounts receivable, with our AR days decreasing to 48 compared with 50 at December of 2016. Free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations less capital and non-controlling interest, was $564 million in the quarter compared to $779 million in Q1 of 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.139 billion available under our revolving credit facilities, and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.83 times at March 31, 2017 compared to 3.82 times at the end of 2016. Let me mention briefly about healthcare reform. In the first quarter, we saw approximately 11,900 same-facility exchange admissions as compared to the 12,500 we saw in the first quarter of last year, or an approximately 5% decrease. You may recall we saw about 12,300 same-facility exchange admissions in the fourth quarter of 2016 for a 3.1% decline sequentially quarter to quarter. We saw approximately 49,800 same-facility exchange ER visits in the first quarter compared to the approximately 50,500 in the first quarter of 2016 and 43,900 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Overall, our exchange and reform activity is tracking with enrollment trends we see in our states, which is down about 5% from this time last year. So that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Good morning. Let me begin by giving you some of the volume stats that I normally provide on these calls, and then I will give you an overview of our commercial volumes. It is important to note that the prior year presented a difficult comparison in many areas. For the quarter, and for domestic operations on a same-facilities basis, 9 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 11 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions, 10 divisions had Emergency Room visits growth, freestanding Emergency Room visits grew 16% and accounted for all of our overall ER growth, hospital-based Emergency Room visits were down 0.4%. Normalized for the leap year effect, ER visit growth was approximately 2.2%. Inpatient surgeries grew 0.8%. Surgical admissions were 27% of total admissions in the quarter. Inpatient surgical volumes were particularly strong again this quarter in cardiovascular, orthopedics and neurosurgery categories. Nine divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Outpatient surgeries were slightly down by 0.6%. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes declined 0.5%, and volumes declined by 0.7% in our freestanding ambulatory surgery division. Five divisions in the quarter had growth in outpatient surgery volumes. Behavioral health admissions grew 0.5%. We had solid growth in approximately 85% of our 63 units, but we continue to struggle with a few of our larger units and they are driving most of this slow growth. We anticipate many of these programs will improve the performance over the course of the year. Rehab admissions grew 6.2% in the quarter. Deliveries were down 3.6% in the quarter, which drove a decline in neonatal admissions of 1.6%. Cardiology procedure volumes continued to be strong and grew over 5%. Trauma volumes grew 15% in the quarter. Now let me transition to commercial volumes, which I'm defining as our managed care and HIX volumes. For the quarter, we believe there are two primary reasons for the softness in this segment of our business. First, we believe growth in overall commercial demand in our market has been slowing as compared to the strong growth we saw in 2014 through the first quarter of 2016. The drivers of this issue, we believe, are as follows: one, the decline in HIX enrollment in our markets; two, the leap year effect; three, some notable general economy issues in a couple of our markets; and, finally, softer tourism traffic in two of our large Florida markets. We continue to believe demand for the commercial segment in HCA's markets will grow over the next few years and in an expected range of 1% to 1.5% per year. The second reason for the softness in commercial volumes, we believe, is the impact of competitive pressures. The main drivers for this component are as follows: one, more supply across most patient care settings; two, HIX payer dynamics in certain Texas markets; and finally, a couple of competitors regained network status in certain payer contracts. I want to add a few other observations which I think are noteworthy. First and importantly, outside of a few HIX contracts, which I mentioned, we have not experienced any network changes with payer contracts. That is, we have not lost any access to covered lives, nor do we believe there are any specific HCA steerage issues in our markets. And with respect to our contracting, we are 66% contracted for 2018, and 30% contracted for 2019, at pricing and network terms consistent with recent prior years. The second observation I want to share is the broad based softness in commercial volumes that we saw in general across our markets. Five markets, however, accounted for almost 75% of our declines: south Florida, Houston, west Florida, Orlando, and Las Vegas. We did have a few markets that were up year over year. And finally, commercial ER visits were basically flat when normalized for leap year. Higher acuity visits were up, but they were offset by declines in lower acuity visits. Obstetrics and general surgery volumes were down notably inside of our inpatient service lines. While commercial volumes have been a challenge over the past few quarters, we believe our efforts to build out our local networks and create greater patient access both from an outpatient facilities standpoint and a digital media standpoint are the right tactics. This effort, coupled with our service line, care coordination, and physician development initiatives, are necessary to compete effectively in this segment. And finally, we believe our continued capital investments will create the necessary capacity and clinical capabilities in our facilities to continue attracting commercial patients. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Sam, thank you. Amelia, if you come back on, we'll take questions. Again, I'd encourage everyone to limit your questions to one so we can give everyone an opportunity.
Operator: Absolutely, thank you. All right, and we will go first to Whit Mayo from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, thanks. Maybe just can we first talk about the Houston transactions and maybe how you see the pieces of the puzzle coming together in that market, maybe how the assets strengthen and complement one another? Just kind of want to hear more about the playbook and opportunity that you see there.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, thank you, Whit. Sam, you want that?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: I do. We have 10 hospitals in Houston, Texas today. Our market share is roughly 18% or so, but most of our hospitals are in a region of the community where it's in the southeast and in the northeast. It's not in the northwest. Tenet's hospitals in Tomball are more in the northwest quadrant of the Houston metropolitan area, so this is a new market for us, effectively, in Houston. It adds roughly 4% market share to our 18% and brings us up close to Memorial Health, which also has about 22% to 23% market. So we see this particular segment of the community as growing faster than the rest of the community. It gives us a new market, as I mentioned. We have significant infrastructure in Houston already given the size of our system, and we think that infrastructure can be leveraged to add value to these institutions, and we look forward to getting more information on them as we develop our strategies for integrating them into the system. Houston is in a bit of a general economic challenge right now, as most people know, but we believe this segment of the city is growing, like I said, faster than the community as a whole. But over the long run, we see Houston as a very important market to HCA, and a market with a great deal of resiliency, and will provide good prospects for us in the future.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, thanks, Whit.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI: Thanks. Good morning. Apologies if you already mentioned this, but you gave us some details on the revenue run rate of the acquisitions. Can you tell us anything about what the EBITDA run rate is, and what you think the potential is to ramp the margins closer to the company level?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, thank you. Milton, do you want to...
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Sure, yeah. So looking at the seven hospitals in total, as I mentioned in my comments, it will – annualized revenues will be about $1.5 billion, and the price we paid was basically just slightly over $1.4 billion, so we paid about – a revenue multiple of around 0.9 to 0.95. And so that implies the margin here is probably somewhere in the low to mid single digits in the aggregate on the group of seven, and we believe that over the next two to three years, we have opportunity to make significant improvements in the margins with, like I said, bringing both our scale and operational tactics and strategies to these new markets and these facilities. We think we can improve the margins over the next two or three years to hopefully in the mid teens.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great, thanks. I wanted to dig into the commentary around the volume softness in the quarter. I think last quarter, the tone that I was getting was that really the softness was driven by some capacity constraints on your end. It seems to me like the tone this quarter is more about general market softness in your markets, and I just wanted to see. I guess do you view this as a blip? And how do you think about 2% to 3% long-term volume growth over the next couple of years (25:02) the next couple of years?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Kevin, thanks. Sam, do you want to take a shot first?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: We continue to believe that HCA's markets in total are going to grow in that 2% to 2.5% from an adjusted admissions standpoint with respect to demand. And so if we can maintain market share, we should be in that particular zone for volume growth. There are ups and downs from one quarter to the other, just like any other business would have for us, and this was a difficult quarter from a comparison standpoint because we lost a day. And losing a day clearly means we lose outpatient activity and we lose certain inpatient activities as well, so it presents some comparison challenges. But when we pull up from that and look at what we'll call the normalized effect, we felt it was a reasonable volume quarter. It's not necessarily as strong in some areas as we would have hoped, and we need to make some adjustments and we are making adjustments where we can to address that. As far as capacity constraints go, that probably affected some of our facilities, but when I pull it all the way up to the company level, I don't think on a composite level it necessarily affected our volume performance in the quarter. There are, like I said, certain institutions that really have to manage their utilization and capacity very effectively to create growth prospects for them in the short run. We're addressing that in the long run with a number of our capital projects, so that can periodically present some individual facility challenges. But I don't see that as driving all the way to the company and explaining the company's measures. Our growth strategies I think are very comprehensive. They are resourced very timely and I think sufficiently, and our execution has been good. But we do compete against some very formidable systems, and we have to continually look for ways to up our game, detail our business better, and provide some advantage for the company. And we're doing that in a lot of areas, and I think we'll continue to find ways to improve upon that. So we remain very optimistic with our overall volume picture, with a few challenges here and there in the short run.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Milt, did you want to add something?
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yes, let me just add one other thought to that to Sam's comments, too. I think when you look at the rest of the year, our volume comps get somewhat easier. As Sam mentioned, based on the market share information we had and looking at market demand, we had strong market demand starting in 2014, really through the first quarter of 2016. The demand's rate of growth slowed starting in the second quarter of 2016. So I think as we think about our growth for the rest of the year relative to volume, we will be comping to periods where the volume growth was lower than the first quarter of 2016. So I think too we've got to take that into consideration as we think about the outlook for the rest of the year.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: And we'll go next to Joshua Raskin from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I appreciate the color you guys gave, Sam, on the commercial volume changes. The two things I didn't hear were flu. I'm curious if that has an impact on your payer mix; and then secondarily, a movement to outpatient. Do you tend to see more commercial patients moving to outpatient as opposed to seniors? I'm just curious if those two factors are having any impact.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Our flu volume was up in 2017 as compared to 2016, and most of that was concentrated, I'll say, in the Medicare book, so that did produce some growth in Medicare. I don't think it affected our commercial book in any significant way. The movement from inpatient to outpatient typically is in surgical areas more than it is anywhere else. And our surgery growth on the inpatient was up 0.9%, and we were down a little bit on the outpatient. I think most of the outpatient decline is centered around two things; one, the calendar being a little bit of that. And then secondly, it's a fairly competitive field when you get into outpatient surgeries with other centers, other hospitals, other physicians in their own clinics and so forth. So again, we are adding capabilities in our outpatient surgery platform, and we're working with our physicians to find ways to leverage that further. But I don't think there was much transition in this cycle from inpatient to outpatient creating any unique pressure.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Josh, thank you.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.
Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Is there any way to roughly split out – or how you see the payer mix pressures between sort of exchange-related issues versus core commercial? And then you'd mentioned economic issues in your markets as well as, or in some markets, as well as HIX payer dynamics. Just hoping you could flesh that out for us. Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Sam or Bill?
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Go ahead on the commercial piece.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: HIX was down what...
William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.: So our HIX volume was down 5%. And as Milton – sorry, Sam mentioned, we did have a couple of dynamics in our Texas markets. But overall, our HIX volume is kind of tracking with what we see enrollment in our states with some pluses and minuses going on, so we'll see how that tracks for the remainder of the year.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: And the payer dynamics in Texas that I was alluding to are centered around the fact that we didn't know exactly where the lives in a couple of markets were going to land. And so it took us until the first quarter to see that. And so in Houston, San Antonio and Austin, we did see some pressure on our HIX volumes as a result of the lives landing in certain payers' lap, if you will, that weren't contracted for us because we did not think the rates were sufficient. So we had those dynamics affecting us in those three markets. That was really isolated mostly to those markets. We do have access to HIX lives, but the payer relationships that we have in those markets did not gain some of the business that we anticipated, and so that created a little bit of pressure for us.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.: And can I just add on to that? As you know, for the past couple years in health reform, the first quarter has been where we've seen significant growth in HIX volume. It just didn't happen this year. If you look at first quarter of 2016, we had HIX volume growth of 27% that just wasn't present in this quarter due to the enrollment activity as well.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, and this is Milton. I'll just add that, Ralph, to deconstruct the payer mix shift between commercial and HIX is complicated further by here in 2017 that there's a lot of movement in lives between HIX and commercial. And so it makes really understanding that deconstructing a little more complicated, too, and harder to understand, but I think we've given you our best view of it.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Good. Thank you, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up there. Three of the markets that you mentioned as seeing disproportionate weakness were Orlando, South Florida and Vegas. Anything specific in those markets that you could call out for us?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yes, in Las Vegas, that's the market that I was referring to where we had both UHS and Dignity get back into two payer contracts that in the past few years they weren't in, and that's resulted in some commercial market share pressures in that particular market. In Orlando, we've seen our competitor systems make some significant investments in a couple of areas that has impacted our business there. Both South Florida and West Florida were particularly impacted by softer tourism, number one, and a little bit softer Emergency Room volume than we had seen in the past. Those were the primary drivers in those markets.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, thanks everyone. On the – obviously you got the Texas deals, but you also have the two you've mentioned now in Georgia as well. Would you say that you're seeing a pickup in activity level out there? Is your posture towards transactions that have been there before maybe becoming more committed to doing acquisitions? And can you give us a sense of how this affects your ongoing buyback activity?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, all right. That's one for Milton.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, A.J, so I think I mentioned over the last – one of the last calls we talked about the pipeline being a little more active, but not just with number of maybe opportunities, but the possibility that some of these opportunities could actually come to closure. And I think over the last couple days, and last week, we certainly have been able to deliver that. So the pipeline remains active, so we will see if we can continue to achieve some opportunities for growth through acquisitions. So from that front, yes, it is more active than, say, over the past couple years. Relative to how it affects our buyback, the transactions, the roughly $1.4 billion that these transactions would – in terms of purchase price, it's not going to affect our share buyback approach. We intend to continue to buy back our stock throughout the rest of this year, with the authorization that we have. That was our intention when the authorization was approved by the board back in 2016. So we're continuing that plan undisturbed by these acquisitions. And we've been clear to indicate, too, I think, over the past couple of years with our strengthening balance sheet, free cash flow that we have the ability to both be an active buyer of hospitals that make sense for us and also an active buyer of our stock and so we intend to continue to do both.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: A.J., thank you.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning guys. Bill, just a question on salaries and benefits, that's obviously up year over year and sequentially. Is there anything you would call out, any trends? And also, just an update on nurse hiring and nurse wages.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, I'll start with the trends and let Sam talk about nurse. I've characterized our labor environment, really, for the past several quarters at pretty stable. When we look at labor combined with productivity, wage rates, it's been very stable for us. The labor costs per adjusted admission at a little north of 2% is a pretty good number for HCA. And again, I think it's pretty stable. Contract labor has stabilized on us. We've got a lot of initiatives in the HR around nurse retention and recruitment, and I think those continue to provide benefit for the company.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, this is Sam. The only thing I would add to that is our RN turnover, nursing turnover, has actually improved 110 basis points from where it was last year at this particular point in time. So we are seeing some improvement from some of the initiatives that we have implemented. Our nursing contract labor was only up 5.7% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. We have some other areas where we're investing in contract labor. That's why you see roughly 10% in our year-over-year growth. But that's due to some outsourced departments in certain ancillary areas. So we believe that our nursing initiatives, our HR initiatives and so forth are poised to continue to support this effort and deliver some value to the company in this area.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Brian.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Thanks guys.
Operator: And we'll go next to Chris Rigg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. I know you've talked a lot about the commercial volumes and the details behind what happened in the first quarter, but I guess I'm still trying to get a better sense for what is assumed in guidance for the rest of the year in terms of, Sam, you highlighted a bunch of factors here, what you think will actually get better as you move through the year, and what will serve as a pressure point throughout 2017? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Bill or Sam?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Let me kind of give you the broad brush on guidance first, and then let Sam and Milton add in. So obviously, we know we've reaffirmed our guidance going through the balance of the year. We've got variables that I think give us comfort in that. We look at the low end of our guidance for the balance of the year basically implies a 3% growth in the last three quarters to the high end at 7%, midpoint just around 5%. So as we look at the balance of the year, as Sam mentioned, we look at our volume portfolio, comps get better in the second half of the year. We still believe that 2% to 3% volume guidance is achievable for the company, coupled with our 2% to 3% pricing going forward. Our teams continue to manage our costs pretty well. You look at specifically in the commercial book, as Milton mentioned earlier, you saw those commercial trends start to decline in the last half of the year, so the first quarter still gave us a pretty good comp as our commercial grew just under 3% in the first quarter of 2016. So we think as we go through the year, that gives us confidence that we can stand behind our guidance at this point.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Chris.
Operator: And we'll go next to Scott Fidel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Just interested in an update on where you expect leverage will end the year, just in the context of the acquisitions that you're doing. And then I just had a separate follow-up question just around supply costs, and if you could give us an update there. It looks like they had ticked up a bit over the last couple of quarters, so just wondering if that's on the drug side or anything else that's going on there. Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, hi, Scott. I think Bill...
William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.: I'll take that. On the leverage, as we stated, we're 3.83 times basically right now. Clearly, we've got the balance sheet capacity going forward. It will go up slightly, maybe 10 basis points by the end of the year if we get all these transactions completed. But again, as Milton said, we are optimistic in the earnings performance that that will continue to go back to current levels, well within our range to 3.5 to 4.5 times right now. So again, I think the balance sheet remains pretty strong. On the supply cost side, you're right. I did mention it was mainly due to some increase in device costs, mainly for some high-acuity volume. Overall, we're very pleased with our supply cost trends. If you look over a longer-term trend, we've been able to manage our supply costs on a per-adjusted admission basis at that 1.5% to 2%. Obviously, continued strong performance by our GPO HealthTrust Purchasing Group, a lot of initiatives in the supply chain operations as well as partnering with our clinical teams in certain clinical initiatives. So the device cost that we saw this quarter was really entirely due to volume growth in some of these high-acuity procedures, such as TAVR cases. We've seen our TAVR cases increase approximately 70% versus last year. You know this is a high supply cost area with the cost of new valves. We've also seen an increase in certain neurological cases, which include some implantable stimulator devices. So overall, given the volume growth, the supply cost trends don't surprise us, and we're pretty confident with our supply chain processes today.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick from Mizuho.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Two somewhat unrelated – forgive me, but the first one is just a detail. On ER visits, Sam, I think you said that they were down in the hospital-based ERs, and all of the growth was recorded in the freestandings. How did that dynamic develop? In other words, what's causing that, do you think?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: I think there are a lot of alternative supply for patients to consider on the lower acuity side. Most of our declines were in lower acuity levels in our facilities, so that's what we saw. Our higher acuity visits, the top three categories were up. The lower acuity, the bottom three were down, and the net of that was slightly down in our facilities. I think the leap year effect is part of that as well. So I think we're actually up if you normalize for leap year. But nonetheless, it was much slower growth in the hospitals. We've added units in the freestanding emergency room, and they're embedded in our facilities. And so that's part of the growth that we've seen on the freestanding side as well. But even on a same-store freestanding basis, we're up more than we were up on the hospital side. The other thing I would say is we're using our freestanding emergency room strategy for two things: one for outreach; and then secondly, for quicker capacity relief where we need it. We continue to operate our hospital-based units at almost 90% of our targeted utilization per bed, and so the freestanding emergency room tactic and deployment is a quicker way to market for capacity, plus it puts us in some instances in a different geography that complements our core hospital, so that would be part of the discussion as well.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, thank you, Sheryl. And I think we've got time for just a couple more.
Operator: Okay, great. And we'll go next to Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Thanks for taking my question. On the Medicare waiver funding, where the administration is not only for the LIP [Low Income Pool] program in Florida more broadly, can you give us a sense or any color on the impact of that or the economics to you this year and in 2018?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Ana, I'll go ahead and take this. We still don't have a lot of clarity around the waiver process. We do anticipate there will be increasing waiver requests coming from the states. We have seen the Florida request come in. That one is still pending. The CMS and State of Florida are negotiating the terms and conditions of that LIP increase that's been proposed. So we have no idea at this point exactly how much would ultimately come to Florida, and then if any of that would find its way to us. And again, other states, we'll just watch and see how the year plays out, but we haven't built anything into our expectations for material changes in any waivers for the balance of the year.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Okay, thanks (45:14). Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. One clarification, one question. Just clarifying, and I apologize if I missed you saying this, but the Oklahoma children's divestiture and then all these several acquisitions you announced yesterday, none of that's in the guidance that you've affirmed at this point, correct?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: That is correct, Gary.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, and then just my question: just trying to look through the shift in payer mix, and about 100 basis points year-over-year shift on the inpatient side to Medicare. Looking back last year, you had a similar 100 basis point shift in 2Q and 3Q, and generated EBITDA growth through that, so just trying to think about what's unique about this shift in the first quarter, outside of just the leap year. If there's anything else to add on that.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: I'm not sure I could give you a specific explanation. There's a lot of pieces and parts to a quarter, as you well know, and so the puts and takes are difficult to just sit here and synthesize down to one point or two points. But there may have been something unique...
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: I think Sam, I look back, I think what I would call probably our surgical volume was higher overall, I think back in those periods, it resulted in higher revenue per equivalent admission. So for example, we'd reported this first quarter 1.7% growth. You go back and look at the second and third quarter which are the periods I think you were talking about, Gary, and our NREA growth was 2.1% in the second quarter and 2.7%, so 100 basis points higher in the third quarter. So certainly that is the reason for better performance, and hence it's not just for the payer mix, but the underlying service mix as well.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Gary, thank you very much. And, operator, we thank you very much, as well. And we'll talk to you all soon. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you so much for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to today’s HCA Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference. Just a reminder that today's call is being recorded and for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor Campbell: All right, Laurie. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call including those of you on the webcast. Here this morning as usual, our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazan, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, CFO and Executive Vice President. Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause annual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and included in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA holdings, Inc. excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims cost which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the fourth quarter earnings release. This morning’s call is being recorded as you know and a replay is available later today. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson: All right, thank you, Vic, and good morning each of you joining us on the call and the webcast this morning. Now this morning we issued our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings release. The release is consistent with the preview we issued on the 9th of January. I’ll make a few comments on the quarter and the year and then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter and 2017 guidance. We finished the year on a solid note with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA totalling $2.206 [ph] billion a record quarter for adjusted EBITDA, exceeding our industry as adjusted EBITDA by 3.6%. For the year, we reported adjusted EBITDA about $8.216 billion up 3.8% over 2015. For the full year 2016 diluted earnings per share excluding gains and losses of sale facilities and losses on retirement of debt, and legal claim calls, benefit cost increased 23.6% over full year 2015. 2016 was the year in which we performed well and light of just for comparisons to prior year growth performance. We executed our growth agenda effectively in 2016 as we continued our focus on adding access points to our network, broadening service line capabilities and expanding debt in clinical service offerings. Our growth agenda has delivered consistent performance. In fact, to illustrate the company has reported same facility admission and adjusted admissions growth for nine consecutive years, ER visit growth for 10 consecutive years and surgical growth for three consecutive years. We believe our strategies will continue to be effective and position us well for the future. WE believe investing capital in our existing markets is the key component of our growth strategy. In 2016, we invested $2.76 billion in capital expenditures for expansion of services and capacity in our large fast growing urban markets. And as you may have noted in our guidance issued this morning we expect to invest approximately $2.9 billion in 2017. Moving to cash flow, we generated $5.65 billion of cash flow from operating activities in 2016, up 19.4% over 2015. In 2016, as Bruce will mention we invested $2.7 billion in capital expenditures, we distributed $434 million to non-controlling parties producing free cash flow of approximately $2.5 billion. We returned $2.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases which resulted in HCA repurchasing about 36.3 million shares of our stock or approximately 9% of our outstanding shares since the beginning of 2016. On this subject of capital allocation, the company has not paid a regular dividend since its IPO here in 2011. And we have decided to maintain our current policy on dividend payouts. Although we remained confident in our long term growth prospects, we believe its’ prudent to take conservative approach and maintain maximum financial flexibility until we gain greater clarity of health and tax policies at the federal levels. Today, we believe share repurchase is the appropriate means to return free cash flow to shareholders, but we will continue to evaluate our policy overtime. I’d like to take a moment to comment on our recent settlement with the Healthcare foundation of Kansas City. The Missouri Court of Appeals recently reversed key parts of an earlier court's decision and confirmed that we spent in excess of $450 million during the five year term following our acquisition of the health Midwest Health system in 2030. While we disagree with the remainder of the Court ruling, we felt it was best to end this long standing dispute and we have entered into a final resolution agreement with the healthcare foundation of Kansas City. In the 14 year since our acquisition at Kansas City, we have invested over $1 billion in the market to expand and upgrade our facilities and add new services, and I’m very proud of the work we have done in Kansas City. I’m proud of the settlements and based on earlier court’s decision, the company had reported liability of $478 million. This settlement of $188 million brings a final resolution to this dispute and allows us to continue our focus on caring for the Kansas City community. I’ll close my comments with my thoughts on our 2017 guidance included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA growth, our guidance yield was approximately 2.5% to 6% growth for 2017. Our guidance reflects continued volume growth, reasonable pricing and well managed expense growth. I am looking forward to 2017 and I believe the company is well positioned to achieve its goals for the year. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill.
William Rutherford: Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review our 2017 guidance and I’ll turn the call over to Sam for some comments on our operations. As Milton commented we are pleased with the quarter’s results. Fourth quarter was a difficult comp for us with a strong result we had in Q4 of 2015. However, our extensive management helped to deliver another good quarter and solid performance for the year. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 3.6% to $2.206 billion to $2.131 billion last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 20.7% versus 20.8% last year. In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 1.5%. During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare Admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.7% and 3% respectively. This equates both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 5.3% on a same facility basis and represents 33.6% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.1% and 3% respectively in the quarter, consistent with recent trends. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions declined 0.3% in the quarter, representing 7.6% of our total admissions, compared with a 7.7% last year. Managed care another which included exchange admissions declined 0.4% and equivalent admissions were essentially flat on a same facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented19.3% of our total ER visits in the quarter slightly lower than the prior year. Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 3.3% compared to the prior year period. Same facility in patient surgeries increased 1.4% and outpatient surgeries declined 0.6% from the prior years. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increase 1.9% in the quarter. Same facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.5% in the quarter which is treated consistent with our recent trends. Same facility managed care and other case mix increased 3.4% compared to last year. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $660 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.047 billion in the quarter, an increase of $82 million from the prior year period while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.469 billion, an increase of $578 million over the prior year. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue were down slightly to 44.8% compared to the 44.9% in last year’s fourth quarter. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 5.3% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, this increase was primarily driven by growth in medical device expanded increased volume and some higher acuity services such as [Indiscernible] procedures, neurological cases and orthopaedics. Other operating expenses include 30 basis points in the last year’s fourth quarter a 17.7% of revenue mix. Let me touch briefly on health reform activity in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we saw approximately 12,300 same facility exchange admissions as compared to 11,300 in the fourth quarter of last year. For full year of 2016 our health exchange admissions increased approximately 15% over 2015 levels and represented about 2.7% of total admissions. We saw about 43,900 same facility exchange ER visits in the fourth quarter compared to 38,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015.For full year 2016 health exchange ER visits increased 23% and represented 2.4% of total ER visits. All-in-all health reform activity was generally in line with our expectations. As reported earnings per share for full year 2016 was $7.30 as compared to $4.99 in the prior year. 2016 earnings per share includes positive benefits of $0.39 to the Kansas City legal settlement, $0.41 to the effect of the adoption of new accounting standard related to the tax benefits for equity awards and $0.13 to the completion of federal tax audits for 2011 and 2012. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. The strength of our cash flow and the disappointment of balanced approach to capital allocation remains an important advantage for the company. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $1.699 billion compared to $1.558 billion last year. For the full year 2016 cash flow from operations was $5.65 billion up over $900 million from the $4.73 billion last year. As we mentioned throughout the year cash flow from operations includes approximately $160 million for the full year of 2016 from our adoption of the accounting standard on reporting the tax benefits related to equity awards. After adjusting for this accounting change, cash from operations increased approximately $740 million or just over 15%. In addition, cash flow from operations included an improvement in net AR day’s decrease of 53 last year to 50 at December 31st 2016. Capital spending for the year increased to $2.76 billion from $2.375 billion in 2015 as we continue to invest in long term growth opportunities for the company. Free cash flow for 2016 was $2.459 billion a $595 million increase or 32% over $1.864 billion in 2015 and as a note of mention we completed $2.75 billion of share repurchases during the year. We had approximately $1.85 billion remaining on our $2 billion authorisation as of December 31, 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.1 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and our debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.8 times. Also it is important to highlight this activity through our capital market transactions. Over the past couple of years we’ve reduced our weighted average interest cost to approximately 5.3% at December 31. Our return on invested capital was approximately 16.6% as of the end of the year. These cash flow and balance sheet metrics highlight an important key string for the company and allows us to continue to invest for long term growth, distributing value to our share repurchase program, maintain ample liquidity and maintain our leverage ratio towards a lower end of our stated range, all of this positions us very well going into 2017. So with that, I’ll move into a discussion about our 2017 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimate our 2017 consolidated revenues should range from $43 billion to $44 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $8.4 billion and $8.7 billion. Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admissions growth to range between 2% and 3% for the year, and the revenue for equivalent admissions growth to range between 2% and 3% for 2017. We anticipate our Medicare revenues for equivalent admissions to reflect a composite growth rate were approximately 1% to 2%, factoring a market basket changes and ACA reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases. Medicaid revenues for accrual mission are estimated flat year-over-year and manage and commercial revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%. We also anticipate grow and share based compensation of approximately $40 million and the anticipate operating expenses per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5%. Relative to health reform, we do expect some modest growth in health exchange volumes, but isolating the net EBITDA impact to health reform from core operations that are becoming more subjective and increasingly difficult. We will continue to report on exchange volume which we can identify, but converting these variables to an EBITDA impact has a lot of increase in this fourth year of reform. As an overall summary, we believe reform contribution in 2017 will be materially equivalent to what the contribution we experienced was in 2016. Relative to other aspects of our guidance we anticipate capital spending of $2.9 billion in 2017 as we see continued opportunities to invest in our markets and support a key strategic initiative. We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.05 billion and interest expense to be approximately 1.7 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 34%. And lastly, our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 376.5 million shares for the year and earnings per diluted guidance for 2017 is between $7.20 to $7.60. Earnings per diluted share guidance includes an estimated 150 million income tax benefit, or $0.40 per diluted share, related to the accounting standard on recording excess tax benefits related to equity award, but does that not include losses or gains on sale facilities, losses on retirement of debt, a legal claim costs. So, that concludes my remarks and I’ll turn the call over to Sam for some additional.
Samuel Hazen: Good morning. Let me began by giving you some of the volume stats that are normally provide on these calls. Once again in both the quarter and the year the company had broad-based volume growth across our market and across most of the facilities in service lines that make up our business. For domestic operations on a same facility basis, eleven of 14 divisions had growth in admissions in both the quarter and in the year. Non-division had growth in adjusted admissions in the quarter and 13 divisions had growth in the year. 10 divisions had emergency room visits growth in the quarter. Free standing emergency room visits grew 11% and accounted for approximately 60% of our overall ER growth in the quarter. Hospital based emergency room visits grew 0.7% in the quarter. In the year 13 divisions had emergency room visits growth. Inpatients surgeries grew 1.7% in the quarter, surgical admissions were 28.1% of total admissions in the quarter. Inpatient surgical volumes were particularly strong again this quarter in cardiovascular orthopaedics and neurosurgery categories. For the year surgical admissions were 28.3% of total which is an increase over the prior year. 10 divisions had inpatient surgeries growth in the year. Outpatient surgeries were slightly down in the quarter about 0.6%, hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes decline 0.5% and volumes decline 0.7% in our free standing ambulatory surgery division. Seven of our divisions in a quarter had growth in outpatient surgery volume. In the divisions that were down multiple service lines accounted for the decline. For the year, outpatient surgeries grew 1.2% with a 11 divisions showing growth. Behavioral health admissions grew 0.8% in the quarter and 2.2% in the year. Rehab admissions grew 5% in the quarter and 3.3% in the year. Deliveries were down 1.8% in the quarter and down 1% in the year. Again most of these declines were in Medicaid payers. Neonatal admissions increased 0.5% in the both the quarter and the year. Cardiology procedures grew 4.7% which is generally consistent with the growth rate for the year. Trauma volumes grew 18% in both the quarter and the year, observations visits were up 2.7% in the quarter and it grew 7% in the year. All-in-all the fourth quarter in 2016 were solid periods of growth for the company and they continue to show as Milton said a consistent pattern of growth over many years. We believe our strong portfolio of markets and favorable trends within them should yield overall demand growth in the range of 2% to 2.5% per year over the next few years. Our approach to these markets remains the same as we strive to be the provider system of choice for patients and physicians, the improvements we have made in clinical and operational metrics coupled with our increasing capital spending position the company well from a competitive position and should provides the solid growth prospect in the future. The company has over $4.5 billion of capital in-flight that is just to hit our markets. This in-flight capital which is approved project that are not yet in service and should be completed over the next three years will add urgent care centers and free standing emergency links to our provider systems allowing us to improve patient access and experience with more conveniently located facilities. Additionally, it will increase capacity in existing hospitals by adding more inpatient beds, emergency room beds and operating suites thus relieving constraints in many situations. And lastly, it will enhance service line offerings with new equipment in clinical technology which will provide a better environment for nurses and physicians in delivering care to our patients. In addition to capital spending our growth agenda includes coordinated marketing strategy, patient care coordination systems and multiple human resource programs that are particularly focused on physician developments and nursing operations. This agenda is supported by strong execution systems and resource by the unique scale and operational capabilities of HCA. In sum, we believe we continue to have solid growth opportunities across our diversified portfolio of market and services lines and we believe our local provider systems are well-positioned to capitalized on these opportunities in the future. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.
Victor Campbell: Thank you, Simone, Samuel and Milton. Lori, if you come back on and poll for questions, and as we always do I’m encourage each of you that limit yourself for one question and if you got a second jump back in the queue.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Whit Mayo of Robert W. Baird.
Whit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Maybe just to start with that last point, Sam, if you could perhaps elaborate a bit more on some of the certain, the capital priorities for 2017 or maybe just broadly the $4.5 billion of in-flight capital that you referenced. Is there anything that's for unique or different this year versus the prior-year or third any specific larger project that we should be aware of and then maybe if you could just comment quickly on just the cash flow expectations for 2017? Thanks.
A – William Rutherford -: With respect to the capital spending plan for the company with, for the most part, there aren't any significant changes in our approach to capital spending. We believe the company has growth prospects in many of our markets. We've been investing to take advantage of those growth prospects by expanding like I said our networks where we're adding facilities and so forth. And then at the same time, we have a number of facilities that are operating at unusually high occupancy levels, forcing us to address certain capacity constraints. When you look at our capital spending, that we report in our cash flow statement, some of that capital is being spent but it takes a while for these projects to come online and that's why wanted to give you a sense of what's in the pipeline for the company because we have been accelerating our capital spending. And as this capital starts to come unwind more in 2017 and 2018, then it is coming online in 2016 and 2015 we're expected to at roughly 1% to 1.5% to our bed capacity on the inpatient side, roughly 4% to 4.5% on our emergency room side. And we think those are important component of our overall growth strategy. We spent about $250 million a year on our key capital. We spent about $1.5 billion on routine related capital and in the balance tends to be more strategic addressing these growth prospects and addressing some of these capacity constraints. No bolus is unusually going to one market or the other, so it’s diversified from the standpoint of market. It's further diversified from the standpoint of facilities within those markets and then from a service line standpoint, I would submit that it's quite diversified as well, and we think this is a very conservative deployment approach. It's very effective in resourcing our growth agenda is across the company. And we're optimistic that it's going to yields value for the company over time. And then at the same time we have a number of facilities that are operating at unusually high occupancy levels forcing us to address certain capacity constraints. When you look at our capital spending that report in our cash flow statement, some of that capital is being fit, but it takes a while for these projects to come on line and that’s why I wanted to give you a sense of what’s in the pipeline for the company because we have been accelerating our capital spending and as this capital starts to come in online more in 2017 and 2018 then it is coming online is 2016 and 2015, we’re expecting to add roughly1 to 1.5% of our bad capacity on the impatient side roughly 4% t 4.5% on our emergency room side and we think those are important components of our overall growth strategy. We spend about $250 million a year on our key capital. We spend about $1.5 billion on routine related capital and in the balance tense to be more strategic addressing these growth prospects and they’re addressing some of these capacity constraints. No – is unusually go into one market or the other, so its diversified from a standpoint of markets, its further diversified from the standpoint of facilities within those markets and then from a service line standpoint I would submit that its quite diversified as well and we think this is a very conservative deployment approach, its very effective in resourcing our growth agenda across the company and we’re optimistic that its going to yield value for the company over time.
R. Milton Johnson: Yeah. We’re on cash flow. We anticipating cash flow from operations to range somewhere between 5.3 and 5.5 billion, will be down slightly from this year due to the some anticipated increase in cash taxes.
Whit Mayo: Got you.
Victor Campbell -: What Sam said about increase just to frame it, I'm looking here, it's a two-year period in 2012 and 2013. We added about 800 inpatient beds during that two-year window and 2014, 2015 to your window we added about 900 new beds inpatient beds and for 2016, 2017 two-year period, there be almost 1000. So as Sam was saying is increasing the amount capital coming on my way expect that to grow, we’ll make about 2017, 2018 as well.
Whit Mayo: All right. Thank you, Vic.
Operator: And moving next to A. J. Rice at UBS.
A. J. Rice: Thanks, hi, everybody. I'm going to try to squeeze in two here real quick, if I could. One, obviously there's been a lot of focus on the repeal-and-replace discussion. But there's other things that are in the works, too, one of which is the repatriation potentially. You guys have been overseas, in London in particular, for a long period of time. Do you have any significant cash that you might consider bringing back if there is a holiday? And then my strategic question was, in the last couple of years we've seen payers get involved in purchasing physicians, then they moved to urgent care centers, and now very recently there's been this move to ASC markets. Any thoughts about that? Has that changed the competitive landscape? Has it changed anything that you want to do or just business as usual? Any response to that new competitive evolution?
Victor Campbell -: All right. Hey, A.J, let me let Bill to take the first piece on the repatriation, maybe Sam add some comments on/
William Rutherford: A.J. real quick on the cash overseas. We have had London international operations. We have approximately $400 million cash overseas that if there's an opportunity that would give us some opportunity to repatriate that, so we’ll just wait to see how certain tax policies may unfold to see how we deal with that progress
A. J. Rice: Okay.
Victor Campbell -: A.J. what’s your second question about payers….
A. J. Rice: Payers getting into the providers base.
Samuel Hazen: Well, there’s has been significant movement across our markets where payers entering the provider space. Optum and United have made a couple of strategic acquisitions, but they’re sprinkled from one market to the other and they don’t really have what I call it concentrated influence on any one particular market. Obviously, we see opportunities for us to work with the payers as they try to build out providers assistance because what we’re doing as an organization and we’re having discussions with the payers around using our network and our footprint in these areas to accommodate their objectives and we think there’s a lot of opportunities there for HCA and other payers to accomplish that. But we’re not seeing any significant competitive dynamics to-date nor we see it in the foreseeable future coming from those strategic move across the markets, again, within a particular market there could be a bit of concentration around that, but we had some of those situations in the past in markets already and we seem to be able to work with the payers or around the payers in those emphasis to accomplish what we need to get down in those individual market.
A. J. Rice: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Great. Just wanted to understand the comments around capital deployment, you mentioned, both wanting to understand the impacts to the healthcare regulatory environment as well as the tax policy. Which one is more of a driver, in your view? And when you think about the impacts on healthcare, is there an expectation that there may be an acceleration in deals going forward if things do change for the worse? Would you expect the M&A to be a bigger part of this or would you still expect, for the most part, your share purchase to be the biggest use of excess free cash flow
William Rutherford: Kevin, thank you. Milton, do you want to…
R. Milton Johnson: Yes. And Kevin, it’s Milton. You’re asking which one I guess its most important for emphasis health policy changes or tax changes and with respect to our decision around dividend payment, I’d say its equally driven, right now we need to understand how our dividends be tax in the future versus share repurchase opportunities and so you know, we’ll like to have some more clarity around that before we make the decision on a dividend and have a fixed charge on the company. Obviously health policy is something we’re concern about is well, and we’re following very closely in Washington. So, I can’t really, necessarily rank them because they’re both important into the decision around the dividend. I think with respect to opportunities for acquisitions in this environment, we do have a pipeline today, I’ll comment. I will comment that I think, I will also say as usual, its very difficult to know how some of the opportunities and discussions we’re having will actually turn out, but I will say that the pipeline today is little more robust than it has been in recent years and the transactions feel like they could be more realizeable and that’s just my kind of feel for the market right now. So, that’s a piece of it, but with our strong cash flow that we have and strong balance sheet, I feel like we’ve got the ability to remain active with the share repurchase program and to be acquisitive. So I don’t see a trade off there, but we would like as I said in my comments, we want to remain at this point conservative with our approach. We won’t maximum financial flexibility for the company to be able to take advantage with opportunities that could come in the coming few months or few years. So, we will as I said in my comments consider to evaluate our policy around dividends going forward is just in the current environment. We’d like to have more clarity before make any decision, that’s really a permanent decision with respect to the company’s use of cash.
Victor Campbell -: Kevin, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Matthew Borsch at Goldman Sachs. 
Matthew Borsch: Yes, just a question, as you think about potential tax reform in particular, are you trying to get EPS to be the primary earnings metric that investors look at? And is that something that you've found investors are more receptive to as compared to a few years ago?
R. Milton Johnson: Matthew, this is Milton and Bill maybe jump in, but we definitely believe that investor should be looking at EPS. We have been a consistent repurchaser of our stock. We believe we’ve create lot of value for our shareholders since the IPO. I don’t have number top of head, but billions of dollar maybe approaching not to $10 billion of share repurchase since the IPO. So we think that’s a very effective way also very tax effective way to return cash to shareholders and of course this does results in higher growth in EPS. So it is something we will like to investors to focus on with our current strategy. We think it’s a low risk, late to return cash and create value for our shareholders and so we definitely think that it should be metric that our investors should be paying more attention to.
Victor Campbell -: Thank you, Matt.
Operator: And moving next to Justin Lake at Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake: Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to ask one clarification and jump off my question. Sam you said 1.5% growth in patient beds and 4% growth in capacity. Is that annual number and over what period of the day. Just want to confirm.
William Rutherford: It is an annual number. That’s on average, I mean, we have about 38,000 impatient beds that are operational, so the 400 or so that Milton counted, it’s a 1% increase in capacity and then our ER beds we have about 5,000 ER beds so if we’re adding 200 – 150 to 200 then next we’d get to the 4%. Its important to understand that our impatient bed occupancy for the company is at record highs, we’re operating over 70% in patient occupancy utilization on our operating beds. Our emergency room room that utilization is running almost 90% utilization. Again those constraints create some challenge for us in many facilities until our capital can get there. So that's where the numbers come from, Justin. Those are some of the metrics underneath that, and that's how we are thinking about the roll forward there. 
Victor Campbell -: All right. Now we will get to your [ph] questions. 
Operator: And moving next to Josh Raskin at Barclays.
Joshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. Just a question around the outpatient services trend, there maybe specifically ASC volumes with outpatient surgery actually take negative. I am curious if there is something going on, I mean anything that you can point to that would be a change, you think there is now saturation of facilities as there is too much competition, or is it just a one quarter doesn’t make a trend and we will see later? 
Samuel Hazen: In general I think it's more of the later than anything else. There hasn’t been a significant amount of new supply Ambulatory Surgery Centres across our markets. We do have some under this movement our physicians from centre to the other that sort of typical we've had pretty good growth of trend and are able to towards surgery centre division, as well as our hospital based outpatient units over the past few years, but the last two quarters has been a little softer than we anticipated. We do have had company's division showing growth in an half that are down with a variety of reasons driving some of the declines in some of the markets. I was still bullish on both components of our outpatient surgical initiatives. We are investing in capacity in those areas in some markets, we are adding technology and others, and we continue to work with physician to create the environment that they want for their patients. And I anticipate that we will be a back to our normal growth period, our growth trend over the coming periods.
William Rutherford: I just agree with what Sam telling and I am looking here at our freestanding outpatient surgery growth each quarters. This is the first quarter we had negative growth in the line of 8 [ph] to Sam's. So we have been very consistent growth around, one just under 3% and first quarter of 2016 the manufacturing growth was 5%. So it's been a consistent grower for us. This is the first quarter that we had we reported negative growth in freestanding outpatient surgery next quarter. 
Victor Campbell -: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: And we will go next to Jefferies with Brian Tanquilut.
Brian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Milton, as we think about the ACA obviously a lot of unknowns there, but where guys were sitting right after the election? What's the view or what was the decision internally in terms of like the Plan D [ph] as we think about the potential [Inaudible] appealed in terms of dedication and driving growth going forward? 
R. Milton Johnson: I don’t know think that as we go -- of course lot of uncertainty with respect to our customers that I think what we feel replacement [ph]. I do believe when I think the management team here believe that there will be -- if there is a retail there will be a replacement. What that replacement will look like and how many lives it'll cover, it's been a -- we can't, we don’t know. But I'll say I don’t see it's going back up to the 2024 sort of uninsured volume lies and percentage is population uninsured that we had in 2014. So we had a long history of Brian of being able to react to the market place and to deal with changes in healthcare policy and this is one of the work through I am confident of that. And so I don’t see today any sort of changes and I think we have articulated that in our call this morning changes in our operations and our strategy around operations. We are moving forward. We are investing capital. We continue to see demand up in our markets. The exchange business is important to us, but it yet it only as about 2.5% of extra little volume. So we watched the market place very, very closely and to be able react to it when we see change coming. And this is one of the situations we are going to continue to do that. This next year we will be watching the market very closely as we get more clarity around how we think health policy changes if any in the next two, three years it will impact ACA. We will be very clear and articulating that to our investors and trying to quantify any potential impact. But today we remain very optimistic with our guidance for 2017 and then we will have to see how things work out later in the year. 
Victor Campbell -: All right. Thanks, Brian.
Operator: And we will move on to Ralph Giacobbe at Citi.
Ralph Giacobbe:
. :
Samuel Hazen: The market share data that we have, which is most current is through the second quarter of 2016. Our overall market share is flat. So we have seen some pressures on our overall market share where we are flat at around 25% for that 12 months, period ending second quarter of 2016. I think there are two issues for overall market share being flat. One, we have seen increased competition as I have mentioned in the past in the form of new facilities in a lot of our markets both on the in patient side and the outpatient side and we can point to that as a fairly significant contributor to some of the pressure. And then the second point which cause right back into our capital discussion as we do have significant capacity constraints in a number of our facilities that are poised for growth. I understand we get this capital along, we think that will open up some market share opportunities for the company. On a commercial side, we have seen a little bit of drop in our market share, it's isolated to a handful of markets, but they happened to be big commercial markets for ACA where we've seen an accelerated level of competition in some of these suburban markets where there is density of commercial lot. We have what we think our responsible strategies for dealing with that that’s where urgent care outreach, some of physician imitative and markeing strategies, we think are going to help in that particular funds, but it is quite competitive on the commercial side in many of our markets.
Victor Campbell -: Thank you, Ralph.
Operator: And we will go next to Sheryl Skolnick at Mizuho Securities.
Sheryl Skolnick: Thank you so much. So it was top comp and not an easy business ever, so good job. And thank you for the guidance and the explanation. I want to put it -- dig in a little bit more into your thought process so about the 2017 and then preparing perhaps for changes in the ACA. So for 2017 you help me think about how if you are positioning the company vis-à-vis what we seem to see in the rest of the industry which is declining inpatient utilization coupled with what sounds like some changes in the dynamic with managed care in some of your markets, when do you start seeing that pressure reverse, is it a second half 2017, where do you start to get that the list of the investment you are making versus the competition and maybe gaining back some of that commercial market share, or are we likely to see some increasing pressure of managed care trying to outpatient at the hospital and balancing that out we kind of look the way we do it beginning of the year, because I think that volume assumption is really key to the guidance. And then also what preparations then you are making this year to the potential for having more uninsured next year?
R. Milton Johnson: So let me -- well first of all we don’t believe that inpatient utilization is declining we think ACA market is growing because of population trends, because the aging of the baby boomers the kind of clinical technologies, all those things that have been driving demand historically are going to drop demand in the future at least in the intermediate run we believe that clearly we had a five and six quarters cycle that was accelerated demand that we experienced tremendous volume growth that part of the comparison challenges that we had in the past year. But we have seen a sort of normalized where we believe the markets are going to yield inpatient demand growth of roughly 2% across our market. As far as any managed care activities I don’t think that there is any unique managed care utilization management initiatives or care model initiatives that are impacting the market in any significant way. Possibly on the fringes [ph] here they are not anything at its core and how it's impacting overall demand, nor we see that in the short run to intermediate run either. So those two dynamics aren’t really evident across ACA's market. With respect to our capital and some of our initiatives that amount of money is travelling in throughout the year. It feathers in in 2016, a lot of our projects come in online at different points of 2017, 2018, and so forth. So is difficult to say that there's a bolus that's going to hit in the last half of the year for the first half of the year that's going to change our volume prospects. It tends to feather itself into our overall capacity and opportunities over sort of a consistent kind of timeline where just happening from month to month to month. And so we're not anticipating anything unique. As far as changing our model and approach to the prospects for growing uninsured, this past year our uninsured activity was flat to down. I think Bill, in total...
William Rutherford: 4% growth. We were down in the fourth quarter.
Sheryl Skolnick: Yeah in the fourth quarter. And we've gone through cycles where payer mix have shifted a bit, clearly for us it’s the variable cost that we would incur in taking care of those patient's. As the incremental impact obviously be -- if the Affordable Care Act strips away a 100% of the insurance like Milton was saying, that's a different dynamic for us, but I don't think it significantly changes our core strategy maybe some things on the fringes around how we pace initiatives or how we do certain decision making around that. But we still have opportunities we believe on the core operations of HCA and that they can continue to yield value for the company.
Samuel Hazen: All right, thanks, Sheryl.
Operator: And moving next to Gary Lieberman at Wells Fargo. Sir?
Gary Lieberman: Good morning, thanks. You did a good job of controlling labor expense in the quarter. Can you talk about the more broad pressures you're seeing on labor supply and how much of that is a risk to your numbers in 2017 and then maybe just comment on the robust, taller growth that you saw this year?
Samuel Hazen: Okay, this is Sam again. On labor expenses I’m really pleased with how the company was able to manage it for labor expenses this year. We saw the modest productivity improvement which I think is somewhat of a reflection of the operating leverage that we have from the volume growth. We were able to moderate our contract labor growth for the year. It was only up 6% for the quarter, it was up 4% nursing continues to be a challenge for the company but we are making progress with a number of our initiatives around on boarding nursing, around training nurses, around recruitment in those areas and we still continue to manage that particular component of our expense structure effectively. The trends going forward are modestly under pressure compared to this past year we are expecting wages to be up a little bit, maybe 50 basis points over where they were but that’s embedded in the guidance that Bill gave. From the supply and other expense standpoint no significant inflationary pressures that we see at this particular point in those categories that will create any unusual risk in our expense structure for 2016. So we feel pretty good about where the company is. From that standpoint we have a host of initiatives underneath our expense structure that are driving toward efficiencies and we continue to evolve those, they center around better labor management approaches with one HR platform, our performance improvement change which we’ve talked about in the past continue to find opportunity to enhance processes in our facilities and efficiencies and in our clinical agenda it’s continuing to identify opportunities to improve supply cost utilization, blood utilization, better patient length of stay and those kind of thing. So the combination of those are still a positive opportunity for HCA and one in which we believe we can execute on and mitigate some of these pressures. Thank you Gary.
Operator: And our next question is from John Ransom at Raymond James.
John Ransom: Hi, my question has been answered. Thanks.
Operator: Great. Thank you.
Samuel Hazen: John, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll move next to Michael Newshel at Evercore ISI.
Michael Newshel: Thanks, good morning. With the caveat as you said earlier is getting harder to estimate, but could you just confirm what you think ACA contributed to EBITDA in 2016 and whether that's in line with what you're expecting?
William Rutherford: Yes it did in discover [ph] it in line with our expectations. We said this is contributing 5% to 6% of adjusted EBITDA and that’s a double [Indiscernible] 2016.
Michael Newshel: Okay. Thanks.
William Rutherford: Thank you, Michael.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Scott Fidel at Credit Suisse.
Scott Fidel: Thanks, if you can give us an update on the Florida Medicaid outpatient rate cuts and what you are assuming in guidance and I know that you and some of your peers have been protesting those so just interested if there’s an update on that process there.
R. Milton Johnson: No there are several offers to try to adjust that, but it does not have a material impact on HCA or inside our guidance for 2017.
Scott Fidel: All right.
R. Milton Johnson: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Gary Taylor at JPMorgan.
Gary Taylor: Hi good morning. I have a kind of a two part on CapEx just because it's such a big part of the strategy. It's more than doubled since the IPO. It's running almost 7% of revenues in the 2017 guidance, which I think is around the highest in the decade. So the two part question is, is there a point where you see absolute CapEx dollars coming down? Are we kind of rolling on a kind of a bolus CapEx cycle and that could slow? And just the reason I ask is, I know you're trying to point investors towards earnings, but in 2016 there were $2.7 billion in CapEx and only $1.9 billion of depreciation so there's certainly some EPS benefit that isn’t reflected in free cash flow program and just wondering when those two numbers might narrow?
Samuel Hazen: Gary, let me take a shot at it but this is Sam and then Bill also may also have some comments on it. So our capital spending is really a direct reflection of the opportunities we see in the marketplace and demand that we see. Sam was talking about in certain markets if we don't invest and expand to add more capacity than our growth will be limited by lack of capacity. So we're trying to stay up to speed of that or ahead of that. And so we have been increasing our capital spend upto record levels. Quite frankly at the same time, as Bill mentioned in his comments we have been reporting and seeing a record levels of return on invested capitals as we’ve been spinning more capitals. So I think those investments have turned out to be very solid and good investments and value creating opportunities for our shareholders. Now if the marketplace changes, we certainly have the ability to ratchet down capital spending. And so we've been through different cycles before. When we went through the recession back in 2009, it takes a little while to ratchet down, because the project is in process, but we didn’t have the ability, and we demonstrated the ability to slow it down based on market needs, and the like. So and so I don't see today as being any different. So right now, we're seeing demand in our markets and we're investing too meet the requirements of that demand and again, I've been quite pleased with the return overall on the investments that we've been making.
Victor Campbell: Gary, I think we got time for maybe one more question.
Operator: We will go next to Paula Torch at Avondale Partners.
Paula Torch: Hey thanks for fitting me in. I was just curious about on patient access and maybe going back to the growth in the ER beds. Wondering where that's coming from in particular, is it mostly growth in the freestanding ED space or is it hospital ER beds? And just given the competition that's increasing in the freestanding ED space, are you spreading that growth to other markets that you have where this just less competition? Or are you still seeing growth in some of your more concentrated areas?
Samuel Hazen: Let me give you some facility numbers. First Paula, this is Sam again. On the urgent care side, we operate 72 urgent care centers today. And we believe to be somewhere around 120 urgent care centers by the end of the year. The freestanding emergency rooms we operate roughly 62, I think today. One of them just got converted to a hospital yesterday actually, it opened in Orlando, Florida so we're down to 61 I think as a result of that conversion. But we should be somewhere around 80 freestanding emergency rooms in operation by the first part of 2018. But when you look at the bed top of emergency rooms beds growth, it's a blend of between probably 50-50, thereabouts. I don't have the exact number of the top of my head but it's pretty close to that, between hospital ER bed expansion as well as freestanding emergency room expansion. I do think some of the market dynamics for freestanding emergency rooms has slowed a bit. We're not anticipating the growth in competitor units in 2017 that we've seen in the past 24 months. And so we see opportunities for HCA to deploy these facilities strategically across various markets to put our network in the best position they can possibly be. All right, Paula, is that helpful?
Paula Torch: Thank you. That was helpful.
Samuel Hazen: You are very welcome. I want to thank everyone for being on today’s call. We look forward to talking to you and seeing you soon.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, once again that does conclude today’s conference. And again I’d like to thank everyone for joining us today.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Kyle. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. As usual, Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call including those of you listening to the webcast. And with me here this morning, our chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO. Before we turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause annual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA holdings, Inc. excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's third quarter earnings release. As you heard, the call is being recorded and a replay will become available later today. With that, let me turn the call over to Milton Johnson.
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, thank you, Vic, and good morning each of you joining our call this morning. I trust most of you have had the opportunity to review our third quarter results released this morning. I will make a couple of comments on the quarter, touch on a couple of other topics, then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on our third quarter results. I'm very pleased with our overall performance and execution in the quarter. We've continued use or free cash flow to invest in our markets to support future growth and we've returned cash to shareholders through share repurchase. Let me touch on the results for the quarter at a high level. The company experienced a solid quarter with revenues for the third quarter totaling $10.27 billion, a 4.2% increase from the prior year, driven by 1.5% equivalent admission increase and a 2.7% net revenue per equivalent admission increase in the quarter. Net income attributable to HCA Holdings totaled $618 million, an increase of 37.7% while earnings per diluted share totaled $1.59 per diluted share or $1.61 per diluted share before gains on the sale of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, and legal claim calls. Earnings per diluted share for HCA Holdings before gains or losses on sales, losses on retirement of debt, and legal claims cost increased 37.6% compared to the prior year. As noted in our release this morning, the company also recognized reductions in its provision for income taxes due to the adoption of a new accounting policy on equity award settlements of $11 million or $0.03 per diluted share, and $51 million or $0.13 per diluted share from the completion of IRS review of the company's 2011 and 2012 federal income tax returns. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.957 billion in the third quarter compared to $1.815 billion last year, an increase of 7.8% over the prior year period. We had another solid quarter for cash flows from operations resulting in $1.206 billion compared to $1.101 billion in last year's third quarter, a 9.5% increase. We deployed $712 million for capital expenditures and $355 million to repurchase 4.637 million shares. We've repurchased a total of 29.064 million shares in 2016 at an average cost of $76.16 per share and we had $390 million remaining on our $3 billion authorization at September 30, 2016. We expect to complete the remaining authorization by the end of the year. Let me provide an update on recent hurricane Matthew on our Florida and South Carolina facilities. We experienced some minor disruption leading up to and during the storm. However, we came through the events without any major issues. I commend our entire team for their preparation and planning in anticipation of the hurricane which minimized any disruption of service to our patients. Yesterday, we announce an agreement with University Hospitals Authority and Trust for the early termination of HCA's lease of The Children's Hospital at Oklahoma University Medical Center and also the termination of a joint operating agreement. In addition to the termination, HCA will transfer ownership of its hospital operations in Oklahoma, which includes two other hospitals to University Hospitals Authority and Trust. Under the agreement, HCA will receive $750 million in consideration and the transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017. So with that, let me turn the call over to Bill and Sam for additional details on the quarter.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will add to Milton's comments and provide more detail on our performance and results for the third quarter. As we reported in the third quarter, our same facility admissions increased 0.7% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 1.3%. Year-to-date equivalent admissions are up 2% over the prior year. Sam will provide more commentary on volume in a moment and I'll give you some trends by payer class. During the third quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.8% and 2.5%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.4% on a same facility basis and represents 33.5% of our total Medicare admissions. On a year-to-date basis, Medicare equivalent admissions are up 3.2% over the prior year. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.3% and 3.4% respectively in the quarter, fairly consistent with our recent trends and our year-to-date growth of equivalent admissions of 3.2%. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 0.7% in the quarter. These represent 8% of our total admissions, which was unchanged from last year's third quarter. Year-to-date, our same facility uninsured admissions are up 5.2% from the same period last year. Managed care another including exchange admissions declined 1.8% and equivalent admissions declined 1.4% on a same facility basis in the third quarter. However, on a year-to-date basis, same facility managed other and exchange-equivalent admissions remain slightly up. Same facility emergency room visits increased 2.7% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 20.1% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 20.5% last year. On a year-to-date basis, same facility emergency room visits have increased 4.6%. Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix increasing 4.7% compared to the prior year period. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increase 2.7%. Managed care and other including exchange revenue per equivalent admission is treated consistent with prior periods. And adjusted for certain items, it grew approximately 6.5% in the quarter and 6.7% year-to-date. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $639 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.042 billion in the quarter, an increase of $118 million from the prior year period while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.295 billion, an increase of $521 million over the prior year period. Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was very good and led to a 70 basis point margin expansion as compared to the prior year. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.1% for the quarter as compared to 18.4% in the third quarter of last year. Same facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.4% compared to last year's third quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues decreased 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2015. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 1.5% for the third quarter compared the prior year and supply cost as a percent of revenue improved 20 basis points versus prior year. Other operating expenses as a percent of revenues increased 30 basis points from last year's third quarter to 18.5% of revenue, primarily reflecting an increase in year-over-year professional fees that we discussed on our last two calls. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter with cash flows from operations just over $1.2 billion. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations were $3.954 billion, which is a $778 million increase or a 24.5% growth from prior year. Cash flow from operations is benefited by $129 million on a year-to-date basis due to the adoption of the accounting policy around the excess tax benefit related to the settlement of equity awards. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.050 (11:18) billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.86 times at September 30, 2016, compared to 3.85 times at December 31, 2015. I also want to highlight our earnings per share results. For the quarter, our diluted earnings per share excluding losses on retirement of debt, legal claim cost, and gains or losses on sales of facilities increased 37.6% to $1.61 per diluted share from $1.17 in the prior year period. As indicated in our release, EPS for the quarter does include a $0.03 benefit due to adopting a new accounting policy and a $0.13 benefit from the IRS exam settlement. These strong cash flows, balance sheet position and EPS growth results highlight an important strength of the company. Let me touch briefly on health reform. Health reform activity continued to grow over the prior year in the quarter. In the third quarter, we saw approximately 13,000 same facility exchange admissions as compared to approximately 11,500 in the third quarter last year for a 13% year-over-year growth. You may recall we saw about 13,300 exchange admissions in the second quarter. We saw 49,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the third quarter compared to 40,700 in the third quarter of 2015 and 54,000 in the second quarter of 2016. So overall, these reform trends are tracking in line with our expectations and have been very stable over the past several quarters. So that concludes my remarks and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Good morning. Let me begin by giving you some of the quarterly volume stats that I normally provide on these calls. Once again, the company continued to have broad-based growth across our markets and wide-ranging growth across the various facilities and service lines that make up our business. For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 10 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions, and 12 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 12.5% and accounted for approximately 40% of our overall ER growth. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 1.8%. In addition to the solid portfolio performance across our 42 markets, the company's growth across its diversified service lines was also strong. For domestic operations on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew 0.9%, which increased surgical admissions to 28.6% of total admissions in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to last year. Surgical volumes were particularly strong again this quarter in cardiovascular, orthopedic, and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries were slightly down in the quarter by 0.3%. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes declined 0.9%, while volumes increased 0.4% in our freestanding ambulatory surgery division. This softness was felt across multiple service lines and across many markets, and we were not able to identify any particular issue that drove the softness. Behavioral health admissions grew 1.5%. The issue with physician staffing shortages that we discussed last quarter was still the primary driver of the slower growth in this service line. Three of our largest behavioral hospital units had staffing challenges. And without them, the company's admits in this service line would've been up 4.5%. Rehab admissions grew 4.3%, which was an acceleration in the growth rate as compared to the first half of the year. Deliveries were down 0.9% in the quarter. Again, this decline was concentrated in Medicaid deliveries. Neonatal admissions increased 1.5%, which is an improvement over the growth rate in the first half of the year. Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 4%. Trauma volumes grew almost 15%. Observation visits were up 5%, and finally, the company's urgent care visits in total grew 11.7%. The company currently has 71 centers. At this time last year, we had 50 centers. All in all, we had another good quarter of volume growth. However, the overall growth rate was not as high as we had planned. It is important to note that the third quarter last year was also a relatively strong volume quarter and presented a difficult comparison, with inpatient admits up 2.9% and adjusted admissions up 3.6%. We believe this deceleration in the growth rate was primarily attributable to the following two reasons. First, overall demand growth in inpatient services has moderated. When we study market data from the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, inpatient demand in our markets grew 1.7% for this six-month period. This rate was down from the previous five quarters' average growth of approximately 3.5%, but it is generally consistent with our longer-term view of inpatient demand growth, which is approximately 2% annually in HCA markets. Before I get into the details on the second reason, I want to indicate that the company grew its market share, albeit at a slower pace, for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016. 55% of our markets gained share during this period as compared to 68% of our markets in 2014. The second reason can be explained by growing competition in certain areas of our business. In particular, a growing supply of freestanding emergency rooms by independent companies and health systems in various Texas and Colorado markets has had impact on emergency room visits and some downstream admissions. Also, in a couple of our Florida markets, we continued to be challenged with Medicare Advantage health plans that classified emergency room patients as observation patients instead of inpatient admissions. Overall, we believe HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda and our execution remains strong. We continue to invest significantly in our growth agenda with increasing capital spending, coordinated marketing strategies, and multiple human resource programs including medical staff development. In sum, we believe the company has solid growth prospects across its uniquely diversified portfolio of markets and service lines and we believe our local provider systems are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Sam. Thank you very much. At this time, Kyle, if you'll come back on, we'll move to Q&A. I do encourage everyone, I know we've got a lot of folks on the call today. And as usual, please try to limit your questions to one at a time. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our first question from Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Good morning. So thank you for mentioning that this was a tough comp in a tough quarter. From that perspective, I think folks have maybe forgot to put it in that perspective. But I'm curious since you're seeing this moderating in growth, one of the ways you might deal with that is by repositioning the portfolio to perhaps focus your capital spending and your capacity expansion efforts in more attractive markets. Was that behind the Oklahoma transaction that you announced at a curious time last night just before earnings or was there some other reason? If you could explore that a little bit and what the opportunities are with deploying capital, I'd appreciate it.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Sam, you want to take that up?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Sheryl. Oklahoma City, let me just give a little background and then I'll relate it to your question, I think, Sheryl. We had a relationship that dates back to 1998 with, I'll say it's the University of Oklahoma. It's a more complicated structure than that because of how the state had to do a transaction with us. But we've had this relationship since 1998 and when the hospitals came together, there were a lot of challenges both for HCA and the University Hospitals. When you look at where we are today, which is almost 20 years past, this has been a remarkable success from, I think, everybody's standpoint and a very innovative public-private partnership. So there's been a lot of investment, a lot of new programs, market share gains, and so forth that have really benefited the system. The way the deal was structured, it was structured as a lease. And we were in a situation, as was the hospital there, where it needed additional capital and unfortunately, the other side was not in a position to extend the lease in any significant way that allowed us to get comfortable in making the kind of investment that needed to be made. So it was felt by both parties that it was better to go ahead and start the unwind now so it could be orderly for both sides of the equation. And that's where we wound up announcing this transaction yesterday. It was a complicated deal to get into and a complicated deal to get out because it was very intricately structured. So that does allow us in the context of what we needed to make his investment there coupled with the type of lease that we had to look at repositioning the capital to be a source for whatever we want to do, whether it was more capital expenditures or other components of our capital allocation strategy. And so it does fit into that and I think that's part of what we considered as we went through our negotiations and our strategic analysis of this particular market.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Sam, thanks. Milton, you want to add something?
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Let me just add that what Sam described, the structure of this particular arrangement, was unique to OU and to Oklahoma City. Our other partnerships that we operate do not have the same structure. So it is a very unique structure how that deal was put together back in 1998. And just wanted to make it clear that our other partnerships did not have that same structure.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Thank you, Sheryl.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right, great, thanks. I want to go back to your comments around volume growth moderating, the I guess demand growth in your markets moderating. And it sounds to me like you are saying it's moderating back to what you see as long-term normal numbers but I guess there's a lot of concern around surveys, and etc., around Q3 volumes and thinking about what the long-term volume is. What's your degree of visibility or confidence that 2% is the right market demand in your markets based upon where things have been trending the last several quarters?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Kevin, thank you. Sam, I think we'll pitch that back to you.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: We go through a process annually where we conduct a forecast of future demand for HCA markets based upon population trends, on macroeconomic factors, on aging and so forth. So that's always a fundamental approach of our business planning process. In addition to that, we compare historically to a longer view to see what the patterns have been in our markets on a historical basis. And we try to merge those two views into our company thinking and company view right now, and that's where we get to the 2% demand on the inpatient side. We think outpatient demand has a little more growth than that. So that process is consistent, and that's where we have landed on our view. There's nothing to suggest from one quarter in this particular year that that particular view is off. And so we're relatively confident today. We haven't finished our analysis for all of 2017 and on that anything materially has changed. I think one thing that's positive in the overall demand is that commercial demand continues to be reasonably solid inside of HCA's markets in these two periods that I discussed in total. And so that's an encouraging metric that suggests our portfolio of markets still have reasonable growth on the commercial side. Obviously there's puts and takes to that, but that particular metric I think gives us some confidence as well that our markets are still relatively healthy and present a reasonable opportunity for growth for the company.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Kevin. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Josh Raskin from Barclays.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. Was curious when you talked about the freestanding ED growth and then your growth also in urgent care centers, sounds like that was up 40% or so. You're growing both sides. How do you guys think about that as both a threat and opportunity and how do you decide within a market if you want to open up a freestanding ED versus urgent care center other than the obvious regulatory and certificate of need if necessary, etc.?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Josh, thank you. I think you're winning the lottery here, Sam.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Well, we have evolved are freestanding emergency room strategy over the past 5 years. I think 5 years ago, we had maybe 12-15 freestanding emergency rooms, we have 56 that are operational today, and I think by the end of 2017 or early 2018 we'll be north of 70. And in that particular strategy, we feel pretty good about how we place those. We see the urgent care as an additional wrap-around, if you will, our freestanding emergency room strategy, where there are certain moments of certain markets where urgent care is the best answer because of either competitive hospital systems or other freestanding emergency rooms, and it provides a component that wraps around our freestanding emergency room or hospital emergency room strategy. So there's a blend of what the right facility is for the right situation. There's population, there's traffic, there's location of other hospitals and other freestanding emergency rooms. And we go through this process of mapping out the market and determining what exactly is the right fit and how do we go about building this network further. In some respects, we try to build an urgent care strategy around our emergency room strategy which is built around our hospital strategy. So it's almost in concentric circles of facilities that create a fairly broad HCA network in these large markets, allowing our patients to enter the system in different forms or different fashions and also creating relatively favorable price points, if you will, for our payers where they can direct as they feel they need to direct but keep them in the HCA system. So it's hard to give you a specific because we have to look at the individual markets, but those are some of the general approaches that we take.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI.
Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks, good morning.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Morning, Michael. You're a little faint. You may want to lean in to your phone a little bit.
Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC: Oh, great, how's that?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Much better.
Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC: Great. So, can you talk about how your exposure to health plan exchange exiting your markets and just in general if there's any change in your level of network participation in exchanges for 2017?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Michael, thank you. Bill, do you want to – or Milt...
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: I'll just make a couple comments about it. Obviously, a lot of movement in exchanges in our markets, as you see in most of the markets across the country. That being said, we still expect product to be available in our markets and probably multiple products in our markets. And we're really watching to see how this open enrollment period develops to see how the lines move around as a result of some of the plans pulling out. Overall, I think on a material level, HCA continues to be very well positioned in exchanges. I expect that we will see some growth, possibly, in our exchange business even into 2017. But obviously, there's some disruption in the marketplace and we're watching very closely. Bill, I don't know...
William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I'll just add in. There's clearly a lot of discussion around the plan participation and premium adjustments and what that might do to enrollment. It is early for us to kind of give estimates for 2017, but we were encouraged by recent reports that they're expecting some increase in the exchange enrollment. We'll have to see where that enrollment is coming from for next year to refine our estimates. I also believe it's important to know we've heard this in various investor meetings during the course of the year, but we got data that suggests there's almost 4 million people in our markets that are eligible for subsidies that have yet to participate. And so we are somewhat optimistic that some of those remaining eligible people may find their ways in enrollment. In terms of plan exiting, most of our major markets, if not all of our major markets, there's another plan offering to catch those lives. So again, I think we're optimistic that health reform will continue to contribute to the company.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Bill. Thanks, Michael.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.
Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick one first. Any prior period revenue that came through in the third quarter? And then separately, just the slowing managed care volume – just any commentary around what may be driving that? And perhaps how to reinvigorate that category? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Bill?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Ralph, I'll take the first. There was no material out-of-period revenue adjustments in the third quarter.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: And then, Sam, you want to talk about managed care volume?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I'll say this in general. Obviously competition for commercial business is the most intense in all of our markets. Everybody understands the implications of the commercial book, and so there's significant competition in that particular area. But what HCA is doing structurally to compete in those environments is similar to what we just talked about. How do we create outreach into these commercial segments through outpatient facilities, through freestanding emergency rooms, through growth in our outpatient surgical platforms where we can start to develop relationships with our patients in a way that allow them to be connected and loyal to the HCA system? Additionally, with our physician strategies, we're very targeted in working with our physicians who have commercial books of business to expand their capabilities, allowing us to reach further into those particular arenas and hopefully drive downstream business. And then finally, working with our health plan to come up with ways to help them grow in a way that benefits our system. So I think our overall approach is built around the basics of our growth architecture, including where we deploy capital expenditures. We're focusing our capital on those facilities that have great opportunities in commercial markets or in outpatient facilities in commercial markets. So that's a part of our screening, if you will, for deploying capital because the return prospects are greater in those particular scenarios. But our competitors do that, too, so it's a very competitive landscape, and there's movement in and out periodically from who's gaining and who's losing in those environments. But we're very comfortable with the approach and how we have deployed it. We think there are new opportunities with customer relationship management through digital technologies, patient navigation and other ways to differentiate HCA further, and we're continuing to invest in those initiatives as well. And we think we've got opportunities to respond to this dynamic and this market as we move forward.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Ralph, thank you.
Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Interested if you could talk about the underlying wage inflation trends that you're seeing in the third quarter? Clearly it looks like expense management overall was quite strong, but just interested in the underlying inflation trends that you're seeing relative to earlier this year. Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Scott. You want to...
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Well, let me just mention – this is Milton. I mean, we're not seeing really any substantial change in our wage rate and wage inflation. I think as we've been saying over really the last few quarters, we have pockets of wage pressure from time to time. We're always monitoring the marketplace. We make those adjustments. It's in our run rate, and nothing in particular this quarter, Sam, that I see in the wage inflation that's any different from recent trends.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: And I would add, Milton, that our cost per FTE, when we look at our SWB per FTE, which includes benefits, contract labor and wages as a whole was actually at its lowest point on a year-over-year growth rate in the third quarter. So we have seen moderation in contract labor. We have, as Milton said, made these adjustments ongoing to different markets in different situations as they've surfaced, and we're at a pretty good point we believe with wages. There are clearly some still pressure points across the company, but it's not in all 42 markets. And it's not requiring us to do something uniquely across all 42 markets.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thank you, guys. Thanks, Scott.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from A. J. Rice with UBS.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, everybody. I know over the next month or two you guys are going to sit down with the field operating people and think about budgets, but at a high level – and obviously not asking for specific guidance but more broad thoughts about, what are the big variables? I mean, it sounds like a lot of things you sort of feel like you have pretty good trajectory, but as you think about next year, are there any broad headwinds, tailwinds, that people should think about or keep in mind? I know figuring out volumes is always one source of volatility, but I guess you're saying probably around 2% is the way to think about at least the entire company. But how about more broadly, away from volumes? Any other headwind, tailwind that you'd highlight?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. A. J., thanks. Milton, you want...
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Well, obviously, A. J., as you just stated we're not prepared to give 2017 guidance this morning. We'll do that on our next call. But we've been I think pretty clear about how we think about the business. Volume is a big variable obviously in our business but, as Sam just described, we have our processes and ways that we look at the future. And we've been very clear that we think in our markets over the longer term, somewhere around 2% is the outlook. And we've been, I think, very public about that. When you think about the pricing side of our business, we've got good visibility into our managed care portfolio and our managed care book, and a substantial portion of 2017 under contract with rates and structure similar to what we've had the last couple years. So a pretty stable outlook there. And then wage inflation and overall inflation in our markets, the outlook is probably similar to what we've been seeing in the last couple of years. We just talked about wages, and no particular broad-based pressure there. So we feel good about where we're headed going into 2017, coming out of this year. But we've got a lot of work to do, as you said, over the next two months to put the details around all that. But our long term guidance of this 3% to 5%, 4% to 6% sort of EBITDA growth is – we've been very public about our expectations and don't see changing that this morning.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: I think that's good. And I guess the other thing I would add is, I think we have good visibility on Medicare, and we don't see any material changes in the Medicare revenue outlook.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, A. J.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Vic, maybe this is one for you, but any thoughts on additional states that you're in expanding Medicaid and how the outcome or different outcomes of the election might impact that?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Gary, I think most everyone would agree, if the Republicans gain control of the White House and what have you, there will be pressures and probably less opportunities for states to expand Medicaid. If the Democrats are in place there, I do believe that there will be consideration, hopefully. Maybe see some additional incentives, maybe a little more flexibility in bringing some states to bear. And you would hope that some of the states that haven't expanded Medicaid will look at this as, ACA is not going away. There's money there that can help our states and get people insured. So I'm not about to say every state goes, but I think you'll start to see some – hopefully, you'll start to see some movement.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Any states where you're more optimistic than others?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: You know what, it's hard to point out states. I mean, I sit here in Tennessee and I'm hoping Tennessee will go there because I know at one point our governor tried and, again, you've got the issues – not only the governors don't have total control but you had a Republican governor here that would've liked to expand it and his state legislature wasn't going to let him do it. You would hope that maybe the ball can move there, and there are half a dozen other states that might be in similar positions that might consider it.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks, good morning. Sam, you talked about inpatient demand up 2% in your market, and I was just curious what you would project for adjusted admission growth given that – with that number? And can you give us your view on the sustainability of your 20 or 30 basis points of market share gains target as you go into 2017, given your earlier comment here? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: As I indicated, Justin, the outpatient side of the equation we think is growing slightly faster than the inpatient died and we've estimated over time that there's maybe 50 basis points of add-on, if you will, to the adjusted admissions factor. So it puts you in that 2.5% zone as maybe a demand growth for adjusted admissions. Obviously, the emergency room is a big piece of that. Outpatient surgery is the second-largest piece of that component, and then it drops off from there where it's not as segmented as those two, when you start looking at the outpatient market. With respect to our market share trends, historically, you're correct. We've tended to average 25-40 basis points per year of company-wide market share growth. That has slowed a little bit because we've seen more suppliers in certain components of our business, as I indicated in my commentary, and then we've seen other components of our strategy, if you will, replicated. So we're having to up our game. And that's what we're doing. Our teams are challenged with coming up with innovative ways to deal with the competitive dynamics that have taken place within our markets. Again, we're leveraging great ideas from one market to the other to help the company stay ahead of our competition where we can. And we think some of our outreach efforts, our urgent care strategy, and our very effective physician development strategies will continue to help the company stay competitive and hopefully put ourselves in a position to sustain our market share gains as we move forward. It's really difficult for me to say how one year, the next year's going to play out, because I don't have visibility into exactly what our competitors are going to do, but largely our competitive landscape is not significantly different than what it was in the previous year. So I think that could be some incremental movement from one market to the other, and we just need to be prepared to deal with that. And I think we are. And we're doing everything we possibly can to sustain that kind of performance.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Justin.
Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning. Sam, you gave some comments earlier about the different regions, butt I was – 10 out of 14 with positive growth – but any other more detailed geographical color, parts of the country that are doing better or worse? And then, any parts of the country where you're seeing any pressure on these supplemental payment programs? Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Sam, you want one? And Bill, two.
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: I think the statistical challenges that we've had with admissions and so forth were somewhat acute in East Florida division and the West Florida division. But that was mostly attributable to the Medicare Advantage observation issue. The number of patients in our hospitals in both of those divisions were up when I bundle the two. But when it comes to admission statistics, then it obviously looks like those two divisions had challenges. When we get underneath that, we don't see that to be a significant issue. When you look at Texas compared the Florida, the state of Florida is a little bit more in a growth mode as far as the overall market, slightly up, but Texas continues to be a very good market for us with respect to overall growth of our markets and so forth. We have had a little bit of challenge in a couple of Western markets, because of some dynamics with some of our competitors that got back into health plans when previously they weren't in certain health plans. So we've seen some of our physicians go back to our competitors. But all-in-all, a 10 out of 14 is very good. And just on the admission side to give some perspective, the four that were down, one of them was down 0.5%, one was down 1% – this is admissions – one was down 1.5% and one was down 3%. The one that was down 3% had the most Medicare Advantage issues. On an adjusted admission basis, one of them was down 0.2%, one was down 0.4%, and one was down 1.3% and 1%. So we're talking almost 14 out of 14. And when we normalize for some of these things, it would have been a little different number. So that's part of how we're looking at it, Frank, and we don't see anything unique in any one particular market that's really compromising the company in any significant way.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: And Bill, you want to take...
William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, just real quick. You know our largest supplemental payment program is in Texas with the Texas Waiver program. That is scheduled to continue through December 2017. I know there's ongoing discussion between the state and HHS how that may be adjusted post December 2017. It's too early for us to call, but it looks like it's stable through next year.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, thank you.
Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian G. Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Question on capital deployment. You have cash flows remain really strong. You're getting $750 million from Oklahoma. What do you see in terms of where acquisitions for next year, what areas? And then, how are you thinking about returning capital back to investors, both buybacks and the possibility of a dividend? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Bill, do you want to lead on that?
William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Sure, Brian. Well, we're at that time of the year when we're working on our plans and, as mentioned in my comments, we'll finish our current $3 billion dollar share repurchase authorization by the end of this year and we'll have substantial free cash flow next year. And as we think about capital allocation, think about our cash flow from operations, probably be somewhere around $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion this year. As we think about that cash and the allocation of the capital, the first thing we do is reinvested back in our existing markets. And this year, that'll probably be about $2.7 billion. I would expect next year would be a similar amount, maybe up a little bit, but around that same number. So that leaves us substantial free cash flow that obviously we could use for acquisitions. We always have a pipeline. We're looking for opportunities. Most recently, those acquisition opportunities have been tuck-in acquisitions complementary to our existing markets or in outpatient acquisitions like urgent care that Sam's talked about. We'll probably continue to see those opportunities into next year we'll be obviously well-positioned to take advantage of them as they come to us. Larger acquisitions, they're always a possibility. We remain optimistic we'll have some good opportunities. But as you know from recent years, those are hard to predict when they will happen. But again, we remain with the balance sheet and the financial capability to take advantage of those if they present. And we'll always be looking out for those opportunities. And that leaves us then returning cash to shareholders. And I don't think any of these are mutually exclusive. I mean, I think if you look at HCA, we've had a very diversified approach to our capital allocation. I think we'll continue to have a diversified approach to capital allocation and we will be looking at deploying additional cash to shareholders in 2017. We will be reviewing the possibility of a dividend. We'll have to think that through. If we decide to do it, we'll probably talk about that in our next call. But we'll continue, I think, to be a repurchaser of our stock. We've been very pleased with investing our free cash flow back in our company stock. We think we've been doing that for a number of years since we've been public again. And it's been, I think, a great return on investment for our shareholders. So that's how we think about it, and we'll have more details on exactly what we'll do in 2017 when we have our fourth quarter call and release our 2017 guidance.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Brian.
Brian G. Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, thank you. Maybe just if you can comment on the Medicare Advantage observation issue, how that's come up. Has it been specific to one payer or one or two payers or has it been across the board? What do you think has triggered that and how you're dealing with it?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right, Matt. I think, Sam, you want that one?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yes. The issue is more than one payer. That's the first point and it's more than one market. It's mainly in the Florida markets, like I said, but we have seen situations like this before in other markets in Texas. And I think you have to deal with it on really three ways. One, we have to work with the payers to come up with a process that doesn't put us in a situation where we're disputing each other's classification of patients. And we're doing that. We're having active dialogue with payers now on the concerns that we have. We're listening to their issues seeing if we can find resolution there. The second thing we can do where we disagree, we dispute and go through a dispute resolution process to try to resolve it. That's obviously a little bit more of a protracted process. And then the third thing that we do if we can't reach a resolution on either one of those steps is we work with our medical staff to establish what we believe to be appropriate clinical protocols and require that those protocols be processed, if you will, appropriately by physicians who are making those decisions. We have done that in some instances and that's allowed us to get through this particular situation. The economics are not significantly different between observation and inpatient in some payer contracts, but others it can be. And that's where we have to be, again, very appropriate in how we respond to it. But those are some of the approaches and we continue to work through those in this particular situation that we have, primarily in Florida.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Matt.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks. I don't think I've heard much of an update around the HCA's physician strategy in some time and I think you aligned with some medical schools in the past year, particularly in Florida. Just curious if there is any new strategy around physicians, G&E programs, anything new that you're developing that you can share?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Sam, you want that one?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: The physician strategy for the company I think has evolved significantly over the past five or six years where we have grown our active medical staff, Whit, by about 2% to 2.5% per year. We have roughly 38,000 physicians who are active participants on HCA's medical staff across all of our entities. Of those 38,000, about 4,000-plus are employed by the company, a split between primary care and specialists in that particular category. But what we have done structurally is evolved our approach to interacting with our physicians and providing them voice in our facilities, creating efficient and clinically capable institutions and really showing our physicians that we can grow the practices for them in a way that meets their objectives. And I think that's sort of the HCA way, if you will, around our physician approach. We have evolved, as I indicated, over the five years, and we believe it makes sense in a lot of our markets to advance medical education training. And we have added graduate medical education programs across the company over the last year and we will continue to invest in additional graduate medical education programs. That is providing opportunity for us to respond to market needs where there are physician shortages. It's also creating opportunities for us to improve our operations within our facilities. And then finally, it's addressing potential strategic issues and allowing us to generate physicians who can support our service line development and our overall growth agenda. So we're very excited about where we are with our graduate medical education program. We have consolidated that division into our Physician Services Group under Mike Cuffe, who has deep experiences with that. And he and his team are working to bring about best practices to create academic curriculum that can be scaled across the organization. And we think this is going to be a unique model that makes for a very competitive and responsive graduate medical education solution for many individuals who want to go down this path.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Whit. Couple more questions.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. So my question is on the other two components of your growth model. The volumes you say are 2% but looks like the mix shifting to lower-priced service sites is going quite aggressively, and there's price discounting with mandatory bundling. What are you thinking about on pricing growth? And then on sustainability of bad debt, which was a pretty important component of your growth for this year?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Bill, you want to start.
William B. Rutherford - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I'll give it a start. So our pricing, if you look at our revenue per equivalent admission, has been very stable over the past quarters and years. We anticipate 2% to 3% growth of NRAA, we saw 2.7% this quarter, and it's fairly consistent for the past several quarters. So as Milton mentioned, we've got pretty good visibility into our contracting position for next year. Couple that with our program investments, I think that's a good stable range for HCA. Bundle payments is being initiated. We participate in that, but it's not yet really a material factor that alters kind of the revenue profile for HCA at this stage, but I think we'll continue to see more of that going forward. And on bad debts, our uncompensated care trends have also remained very stable. You look at our uninsured volume trends for this quarter, 5% on a year-to-date basis, which is lower really where we anticipated them falling out at, in the high single digits. So I really characterize that overall environment for HCA as very stable.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Good. Thanks, Bill.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Thank you for the color.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Sorry, had to find the phone. Thank you. Maybe just as a little bit of a follow-on, I just wanted to ask about your view on sustainability of margins. I think you began the year, you upped your long-term EBITDA growth forecast of 4% to 7%, but now we've had a few quarters where the revenue alone is at the lower end of that. And to get into that EBITDA growth forecast, you'd have to see some margin expansion, which seems difficult with revenue at the low end. So can you just talk about your view of sustainability of the company's current margins as you move out the next couple years?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Gary. Milton?
R. Milton Johnson - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Yes, I'll make a couple comments. Bill may have some thoughts too. Gary, as you know, looking at our margins over the last several years, it's been very stable, somewhere around the high-teens level, close to 19%, or above 20%. And so right now we are near 20% and we're running at the low end of our revenue expectation, which is, say, in that 4% to 6% range. So I'm very, very pleased with the team's execution in terms of this quarter to have EBITDA growth just under 8% off just over 4% net revenue growth is a real, I think, compliment to the execution. I want to give that compliment to the team. I think as we go forward, that's kind of the outlook we have. We think in this sort of inflationary environment that we're in, if we can grow revenue – if we're at the low end of our expectation, our goal is to maintain margins. If we can move to the high end, we think there could be some good opportunity for margin growth. From time to time, we're making investments for the future, we're investing in programs like trauma. We're investing in physician programs that Sam's touched on. And a lot of those investments have to run through the P&L and not just on the balance sheet. And so we'll make – we have been making those investments. They're in the run rate, and we're going to continue to make those, because really it's our future and it's going to allow us to continue to grow. So from time to time we may move around a little bit with that, but I feel like as an objective and a long-term outlook, I think our margins are at a very good level, but I think if we can grow our revenue at the high end, there's still some opportunity, I think, for margin growth.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Milton. We have time for one last question.
Operator: We'll take our final question from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.
Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi there, folks. Two quick questions on your managed care contracting trends. Was interested in how much narrow network growth you're seeing and how important that's becoming going into 2017 for you? And then comparably, what sort of increase are you seeing in your risk taking or capitation or other sorts of arrangements with managed care?
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Sam, you want to conclude with this one?
Samuel N. Hazen - HCA Holdings, Inc.: The narrow networking issue is most applicable to the exchange contracting and not to the overall broader commercial book. So exchange volume builds (57:13) about 2%, 2.5%. I would say a component of that, not all of that, is connected to narrow networking and those type of structures. And that's not really gaining ground significantly on the larger commercial book. With respect to the company taking risk and so forth, we do have some elements of risk taking, it's predominantly on a physician practice side and not on the hospital side of the business. So it's a very small piece of the company's overall revenue. But more inside of our physician component than it is inside of our hospital component. And that's where our contracts are really positioned in the next two to three years, and that seems to be what our payers are asking of us and what we think is right for the company. So.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: All right. Sam, thank you. Lance, appreciate it.
Victor L. Campbell - HCA Holdings, Inc.: Thank you all for participating today and look forward to seeing you soon.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone. Welcome to the HCA Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead sir.
Victor Campbell: Thank you, Adam and good morning to everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I'd like to welcome everyone on today's call, including those of you that are listening to the webcast. And with me here this morning with me is our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO. Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in press release that we issued today, and in our various SEC filings. Several other factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, and legal claims costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's second quarter earnings release. As you heard the call is being recorded. A replay will be available later today. With that I'll turn the call over to Milton John.
Milton Johnson: All right thank you Vic and good morning everyone joining us on the call and the webcast. I hope each of you has the opportunity to review HCA second quarter results release this morning. I made a few comments on the quarter and our thoughts on 2016 data and then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter's result.  Net income attributable to HCA Holdings increased 29.8% to $658 million or a $1.65 per diluted share, a 39.8% increase compared to $507 million or $1.18 in the prior year second quarter. As noted in our second quarter release, we recognized $4 million tax benefit or $0.11 per diluted share related to the early adoption of the new accounting standards which reduced our provision for income back to us.  Adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.052 billion, an increase of 2.2% over the prior year. We experienced volume growth in both our admissions and the business although at a more modest growth rate as compared to each quarters. Same facility admissions increased 0.6% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.6%. Same facility emergency room business increased 4.1% over last year second quarter.  Inpatient and outpatient surgery volumes reflect solid growth over the second quarter last year. Total surgery cases grew 1.6% on a same facility basis. Sam will provide additional comments on our volume trends in just a moment. Once again we experienced strong growth and cash flow from operations totaling $1.349 billion compared to $1.057 billion in the prior year second quarter, an increase of 28%.  With only $663 million capital expenditures and $1.237 billion to purchase 15.506 million shares which included $750 million for repurchased 9.613 million shares during the quarter. We have repurchased a total of 24.427 million shares in 2016 at an average price of $76.4. We had approximately $750 million remaining on our $3 billion authorization on June 30, 2016 and also during the quarter we purchased 3 hospitals in the Dallas Fort Worth and Austin Texas markets which we believe will broaden the strength of our market presence in the future.  We expected the inpatient and outpatient services growth in our markets in the years ahead. We are committing capital to meet this increase in demand. For example we recently announced a $650 million capital commitment about Miami state and Palm Beach and county facilities to expand and upgrade our patients service offerings. This includes the construction of a new facility on the campus in Melbrook Southeastern University in Florida along with several other expansion and facility upgrades within the markets.  These investments will allow us to better serve our communities, respond to the growing demand for healthcare services and provide the highest level of patient care experience. I want to take a minute to recognize a number of senior appointments we have announced over the past quarter, all of whom have been promoted from the HCA. Due to retirements, we have made the new division president and addition we announced the new Senior Vice President of Employer Engagement.  These are all seasoned professionals with many years of experience in their discipline and in HCA. They know our culture, they understand our business strategy and I am extremely pleased that we have a big bench to ensure strong continuity. So, congratulations to all of them. Now moving to 2016 guidance, primarily due to volume growth at the low end of our expectations during the first six months of 2016, we are reviving our full year 2016 guidance expectations.  As noted in this morning's earnings release our revenue range is now estimated to be between $41 billion and $42 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to range between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion and our adjusted EPS range is now estimated to be between $6.40 to $6.70 per diluted share, reflecting increased net income, share repurchase and the favorable impact of change in accounting status to forward our tax-rate for the first 6 months of 2016.  Our guidance for capital expenditure for 2016 remains around $2.7 billion. So, with that I will turn the call over to Will. 
William Rutherford: Good morning everyone, I will add to those comments and provide more details on performance and our health in the quarter. As we reported in the second quarter our same facility admissions increased 0.6% over prior year and equivalent admissions increased 1.6%. Sam will provide more commentary on volumes in a moment.  But I will give you some turnings by [ph]. During the second quarter same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.2% and 2.1% respectively. This includes both traditional and both management Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.9% on same facility basis and now represent 33.5% of our total Medicare admissions.  Same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.5% and 2.1% respectively in the quarter which is fairly consistent with our recent trends. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 5.7% in the quarter and may represent 7.5% of the total admissions compared to 7.1% in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date, our same facility uninsured admissions are up 7.8% in the same period last year.  Managed care and other which include exchanged admissions declined 1.6% and equivalent admissions declined 0.8% on the same facility basis in the second quarter compared to the prior year. On a year-to-date basis same facility managed, other and exchanged admissions of prior year and equivalent admissions are up 0.9%. Same facility emergency room business increased 4.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year and the same facility self-pay, charity and ER business represent 19.4% of our total -- in the quarter compared to 19.3% last year.  Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter with our same facility case mix of 3.9% compared to prior year period. Same facilities surgeries increased 1.6% of the quarter and same facility inpatient surgeries increased 1.8% and outpatient surgeries increased in 1.5% in the prior year.  Same facility for equivalent admission increased 2.1%. Same facility managed care and other including exchanged, revenue admission increased 5.8% in the quarter. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounting increased $863 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $1.097 billion in the quarter, an increase of $207 million in the prior year period while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.085 billion, an increase of $656 million over the prior year period.  Our total uncompensated care trends which you call bad debts, charity and uninsured discounts combined have been consistent over the past 4 quarters. Now turning to expenses, expense management in the quarter was good. Same facility operating expense for equivalent admission increased 2.4% compared to last year second quarter.  Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin adjusted for share based comp and income was 20.5% for the quarters compared to 0.7% in the second quarter of last year. Sequentially it has increased 40 basis points from the first quarter of this year. Same facility salaries for equivalent admission increased 2.4% compared to last year second quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015.  Same facilities supply expense equivalent admission increased 0.9% in the second quarter compared to the prior year period grow in surgical volumes and impact in its volume growth was offset by several supply change initiatives and this help leads to supply cost in for some revenues increased 20 basis points versus prior year period.  Other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 30 basis points from last year's second quarter to 18.0% of revenues primarily reflecting a year-over-year increase in our professional fees that we discussed on our first quarter call. However, other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has remained level for the past. We recognized 5 million electronic health record incomes in the quarter compared to $18 million in the last year second quarter consistent with our expectations. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter with cash flow from operations totaling $1.349 billion. Year-to-date cash flow from operations $2.748 billion or 32.4% increase from prior year.  Cash flow from operations is benefitted by a $118 million on a year-to-date basis due to the adoption of the accounting policies about excess tax benefits related to the settlement of equity. At the end of the quarter we had approximately $1.98 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.9 3 times June 30, 2016 compared to 3.85 times at December 31, 2015.  I also want to highlight the earnings per share results. For the quarter our diluted earnings per share before considering losses on retirement of debt, legal claim cost and gain or losses of same facilities increased to $1.66 per diluted share from a $1.37 in the prior year period. When adjusted for the $0.11 benefit, the adoption in the near counting policy represents a 13% growth over prior year in the quarter. These strong cash flow trends, balance sheet provisions and EPS sops results highlight an important strength of the company.  Let me touch briefly on Healthcare reforms. Health reform and care continue to grow in the quarter. In the second quarter we saw approximately 13,300 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 11,600 we saw in the second quarter of last year or a 15% year-over-year growth. You may recall you saw about 12,500 exchange admissions in the first quarter. We saw approximately 54,000 same facility exchange ER business in the second quarter compared to just under 45,000 in the second quarter of 2015.  And just under 50,000 in the first quarter of 2016 so overall each of these trends are tracking in line with our expectations. So that concludes my remarks and I will turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments. 
Samuel Hazen: Good morning, I will start again by giving you some of the quarterly volumes stats that I normally provide on these calls. Once again the company continued to have broad based growth across our market and broad based growth across the various service lines that make up our business.  For our domestic operations on a same facility basis, 10 to 14 division tech growth in admissions, 11 to 14 growth in adjusted admissions and 12 to 14 division tech growth in emergency room business. Pre stating emergency room as it grew 27% and accounted for approximately 50% of our overall ER growth. Hospital based emergency room business grew 2.2%.  In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's across the diversified service line was also strong. For domestic operations on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew 1.7% which increased surgical admissions to 28.6% of total in the quarter, an increase of 130 basis points. Surgical volumes were particularly strong in cardiovascular, orthopedic and general surgery categories.  Outpatient surgeries grew about 1.4%, both components of the service line, hospital based and our division had solid growth. Also, same facility outpatient endoscopic procedures grew 1.6%. Our health admissions grew 3.7%. Rehab admissions grew 1.7%, cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 2%, trauma volumes grew 14%, observation business were up 7.5% and finally company's emerging care business on a non-same facility basis grew 11%.  Two related service lines experienced declines in the quarter. Deliveries were down 1.5% in the quarter and neonatal admissions declined 2.6%. Overall average length of stay increased 0.6% which was driven mainly by the growth in our equity index. We believe our efforts in developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks are driving this increase. I would also note that our inpatient market share for the year ended 2015 shows that ATA continues to gain share in total and across most of its markets. As stated earlier our volume growth, in particular inpatient admissions was at the lower end of our expectations. Most of this can be attributed to 3 areas but before I explain them, it is important to note that the second quarter last year was very strong and presented a difficult comparison with inpatient admissions up 4.1% and adjusted admissions up 4.9%.  First growth in emergency rooms business in our hospital base units slowed as compared to the past few years. As a result downstream growth in inpatient admissions through the ER was not as strong as compared to recent quarters. We believe most of the softness can be explained by three factors. First, a slowing in demand growth to more normal rates, second new competition in several markets and third in a couple of our Florida we have experienced the change as how certain Medicare advantage payer classified the patients between inpatient admissions and observation status.  The company continues to execute a comprehensive agenda to grow our emergency room business which we believe is a service line with strong overall demand growth. Second, growth in our behavioral and service lines were also recent wins. We believe that this year's mostly a result of capacity constraint caused by clinical staffing and a lack of bed for the few of our behavioral units.  On the rehab side of the business the issues are not as easily categorized. We have not opened as many units this year as compared to past year and we are seeing some modest impact in the few markets from the CMS pharma initiative. We continue to invest and recruit talent with the service lines with which we have solid growth prospects in many of our markets.  And finally women and children admissions were down as indicated previously. The primary reasons are broad based software's and deliveries with downstream decline in neonatal admissions. Some competitive issues in the few markets and general decline in the theatric volume due to a milder respiratory season as compared to last year.  These services continue to be an important part of our overall network strategy and we believe the company is well positioned to compete effectively in these areas. All in all the company continues to have solid top line growth and sustained market share gain. Our growth agenda is comprehensive, is well resourced for capital spending and marketing and we continue to execute it at a high level.  We believe the company has solid growth prospects across the uniquely diversified portfolio of our markets and service lines and we believe our local provider system is well positioned to capitalize on them. With that let me turn the call back to Vic.
Victor Campbell: Thanks Sam, I don't know if you have come back on and we will start taking questions ask you as well, we would like to choose questions to one at a time so everyone gets an opportunity. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will first go to Whit Mayo with Robert Baird. 
Whit Mayo: Thanks, good morning. My question is on cash flow. Just really curious on how you expect cash flow from ops to trend this year and really to co-relate to this question is maybe this range of free cash flow after not controlling interest and did that really change after the second quarter versus your previous expectations?
William Rutherford: Yes, hey good morning Whit. As we look at cash flow from operations obviously it's been very strong year-to-date. We are encouraged and anticipate that strength to continue. We have previously said cash flow from operations to be about 5.5 to $5.5 billion; I think we are still within that range and free cash flow being around that to $2.2 billion what we anticipated at this stage of the year. 
Whit Mayo: Great, so no change to that?
William Rutherford: No.
Whit Mayo: Okay, thank you. 
William Rutherford: Thanks Whit. 
Milton Johnson: Hey, Whit let me just add one more. Other than the impact of the accounting change that we have talked about, we haven't projected for that for the balance of the year. 
Whit Mayo: Okay, thanks. 
Operator: Next we will go to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho.
Sheryl Skolnick: Great, thank you so, we all knew it was going to be tough to go up against the great and on volume but I would like to delve into that because you know as volumes go so goes everything else. If I could just recap and ask the questions. First, I think what we are seeing here is no growth across the broad range of types of admissions and payer types but softer than you had expected. I think I heard today that managed care admissions were down so I would like some explanation of that as where it happens and whether or not it's likely to be sustained? Third, we heard you on the other side of this talk about capacity constraints and I am wondering to what extent your capacity constraints is limiting your term growth and what your plans are for investing beyond Florida to what you have announced, you offset that and then fourth you have this fact that you are investing in capacity so, there is a bit of a mix message here the way I am seeing it that you know, yes on the one hand you are pulling in guidance prudently to request a little bit less restraint but still grow.  On the other hand, I hear what you are saying about investing in capacity so it sounds as if there might be a demand story here and a continued execution story so could you tell us what we should think about the near term versus the long term growth and expectations you have for volumes and how we should think about the company in that context?
Milton Johnson: Sheryl thank you, it's a great question. Will do you want to lead with this?
William Rutherford: Yes, I am just kind of give some additional color details in this. But first of all I think you are right Sheryl, what we are saying if we were growth in by its longer term standards, I think very solid growth and I think hopefully we are expressing that this morning. But by recent growth standards, we see it slowing. We went through over past 5 or 6 quarters that was exceptional and we saw demands in our markets growing and we suspect although as you know our market share data lacked about 6 months but we suspect we were going to see some flow in demand in many of our markets and that's why we are seeing it show up in our numbers. That being said we still have a great outlook and a very optimistic outlook for the long term in our markets. Our markets are growing in terms of population and I think we will continue to see demand in our markets and so we are going to invest to meet that expected demand and we have certain markets I know Sam can give some color in the South Florida markets where we announced the $650 million investment.  While we are doing that, and Sam can describe that to you in just a minute but we still think our markets were well positioned in our markets and we are going to invest to make sure we stay well positioned in these excellent markets in which we operate. So Sam, you want to add more color into that?
Samuel Hazen: I don't think though in the second quarter, capacity constraints played a broad based role in the softening. There are pockets where we know that difficult day in and day out to manage the capacity challenge and that could in fact squeeze out few patients here or there but in total I don't think that was a material impact in the quarter.  we have a very sophisticated approach to capital expenditures, we have capacity triggers, we have triggers that we use in determining whether or not we should consider capital of particular situation, and so that process continued nothing's changed, we monitor that in the context of macros within the market a strategic approach within the at a micro level and all that we did the capital decision. Capital take a while to get into the marketplace on average you know 18 to 30 months, depending on the project because we usually doing it to existing assets, so that's timing is a bit ahead, also I think at the point capital property company, but it specifically giving the example of the quarter, what we've done there and have been approved we package them up because we thought it was a very sign of a commitment in a very effective methods for constituent in that market, but without market is the largest healthcare demand market in HCA, so Miami is a big market, we have the largest position in Miami with our market share globally, our volumes over the past five years have grown significantly or at 25%, we have a number of our key institutions they are running 85% and 90% inpatient occupancy, over that time period have grown almost 250,000 visits, almost 50% , it is a large commercial market, so for us and when you look at the macro in we believe we have to get the capacity in play in order to sustain growth over time and in that how we think about these investments, and this is just a very solid sort of micro if you will of a number of markets and the number situation inside of HCA and how we approach it.  But capital is a very important part of market share gains is very important part of continuingly satisfaction, especially our physician and obviously our patients in that they have the kind of facility, Presentation and the technology needed and it continue to play a big part of our overall efforts to grow market share, and position our company to be effective in delivering care in competitive in the market place. 
: : Also refine this please to answer the other part of the question, how should we think about the near term volume outlook for the company's versus the longer term volume outlook and can you just go through the managed care and what happens there?
William Rutherford: Well, I think our managed care, we were modestly there and that a little bit below where we expected this year, I mean the last six quarters have been incredibly strong for the commercial demand stand point across all of our market, and in the commercial volume inside of HCA. We knew that was going to paper, we didn't know when exactly and how much and I don't know that the second quarter necessarily reflective of any near term volume trend with respect to that, I mean the second quarter last year with a very strong commercial volume growth and so that was part of the challenge here we have a couple of markets where there's been some trends changes, the observation issue in the global market impacted our admissions statistic a bit, and that that part of it a couple of taxes market have some, but not materially different than the company has a whole in Las Vegas two of our hospitals – two of our competitors have now re-entered a provide care-contract that previously they weren't in, and we lost a little commercial business there. so there's all these little component that playing to our number but I think that demand will normalize in that trend we think in that short run the intermediate run, our commercial oddity somewhere between one and two, how we think overall demand it 2 to 2.5 potentially, but you know we're not to see some data in the first quarter this year to fully validate those assumptions, but that's where we believe the trends are for the HCA market. 
Milton Johnson: Sheryl, one thing I might just add and that is as we all know the health exchange admissions really grew last year, they get small piece of the company, but if you look at what they added to admission growth last year the second quarter verses this year, while we're still so that's also one factor to keep in mind when you start talking about last year.
William Rutherford: A big bill 2.4% up year-to-date on our admission growth, you recall we gave guidance of 2.5, so we're at the low end of that range and so you think about the short term the next six months you know we think we can finish within the range, but it was quiet in the lower into…
Sheryl Skolnick: Thank you so much. 
Operator: Next we'll go to AJ Rice from UBS.
AJ Rice: Hi, thanks. I might switch gears and ask you about update on the payer side I wonder you mentioned about some pressure from managed care in Florida on observations days which we've heard from some of the others. Can you broadly comment where you had a contract with managed care guys be aggressive on utilization review and then you mentioned Sam I think in your comments about under payments and what you're seeing there can you comment on the government initiatives around…
Milton Johnson: Okay, we are of that 75% 2017 again as consistently sent the past year terms, we're about 15% contract on 2018 similarly, as far as the component of that we are you know not seen any substantial changes in structure, or provisions inside of those agreement, on the observation status issue with more Medicare advantage issue as it was a non-Medicare issue, a little bit on the commercial but not as much, it was more Medicare advantage, but a little bit on the commercial side of that, We're not convinced yet that we're being equitably dealt with on some of those status when you are working with the payers to get a more clinically driven protocol around those, and that we believe will normalize at some point, but none the less that out there is the issue that it had been an issue but it is a little bit more advanced I think in the second quarter. So that the payers side. On the part of payment issue -- again it's hard I have current data, this is a very sort of slow moving data driven process with the government, what I was speaking to put in particular on our only in a couple of markets have we've seen the program the fundamental initiative pilot program have a modest impact on what falls into our rehab centers, there have been some component of our participation in those pilots where we see some modest adjustment in post-acute care referral patterns, again it's across the different components of post-acute. On the other side is way too early to be able to understand what the implications are there, we're just starting to get in the game and again we have seen some modest changes in referral patterns but not to the point where HCA, we believe that compromises the opportunity to develop, we have so and fully integrate that to other components of our business, so orthopedic is an example is not the only driver of rehab business for HCA, Trauma is the driver, clients is the driver, deliver downstream rehab business, and from the standpoint we have little bit drag with -- with the program which got a lot of business opportunity on inside the justified our investment. Rehab admissions -- great deal 1% of our total, so it doesn't really at all.
AJ Rice: Thank you. 
Operator: Next is Chris Rigg of Susquehanna Financial Group.
Chris Rigg: Good morning I just want to ask about labor doesn't seem like you guys are having any issues but given some of the issues that have been discussed by your peers would love just going to transfer what you're seeing in the market and that just you know overall labor. Thanks.
William Rutherford: Thank you. We are very pleased with the last three quarters of performance our management teams in the field they have responded in a very effective way, as you see in our income statement we have been able to maintain our productivity levels, we've been able to maintain our margin level if you will with labor over those periods of the time. And we still facing some level of challenges, obviously we are using more contract labor than we want, however contract labors for the company has stabilized over the last four quarters, and actually for unit basis for the second quarter was below the first quarter, when we look at contract labor for just a patient day.  And retention is a big focus inside our company right now, we have opportunities to enhance our in retention and we have seen an early signs of improvement at a number of hospitals that we are focused on, we have a second workshop for another 20 hospitals inside of HCA, and we're optimistic that will start to see some leveraging best practices in performance there that will over time I think help address some of these challenges, our recruiting function inside of HR continues to improve and get more agile in responding to dynamics in the market, we do have pockets of challenges with wages that we have to step up to deal with, some of those are being dealt with as we speak, some of them been dealt with over the past few quarters, and some of them we will be dealt with in the future. having said that I don't think there's going to be a material change in our composite average hourly rate across the company, it could you know move a little bit from one quarter to the other but largely it is in the zone of really anticipated and we believe it to be manageable. 
Chris Rigg: Thank you.
Operator: Next we have Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan : Good morning, a lot to of good color on the top one issues and obviously you mentioned labor, I am just curious over bad debt side, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and notice that sequentially you provision was down but it's not like any color there? Thanks.
Milton Johnson: Alright, thank you frank, and Will you want to.
William Rutherford: Sure. As we look at that you could see you know it's 5.7% for the quarter and year-to-date basis fall in right in line with our expectations. When I look at uncompensated care that uninsured combined as I mentioned in my comments that I look at one of the past three and even in to Q3 of last year, it remain very stable, when I look at our uncompensated care as a percentage of our adjusted revenue you know it is it relatively flat for the past three quarters, we anticipate on volumes to track with -- that's what exactly is happening so, you know I'm I wouldn't really call labor environment is very stable for us at this stage, our teams are doing a great job as we continue to manage the collection – collectability in the revenue cycle for the last three quarters has remained very stable. 
Milton Johnson: Thank you, Frank.
Operator: Now over to [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning thanks for taking my question, as we head into 2017 maybe discuss your expectations for exchange enrollment and any challenges they might see from some…
Milton Johnson: Alright, thank you.
William Rutherford: I'll try another scenario, obviously it is still early to predict what will happen in 2017, we've always said that we think our exchanged activity will track with enrollment, and you know so far we haven't really seen material markets in that for next year , there is implant market by market but I hadn't really kind of raised up as a material issue for us right now, so I really think we have to see what the enrollment trends are going to be in projected for 2017 to kind of estimate whether or impact it is for us I'm not so sure in comments that we've seen in the market of exchanges early stage material, I don't know exactly what the impact would be in 2017, however we have added some payers here and there, we will lose some payers as they exit and I'm hopeful that our network is broad enough in order for us to absorbed those and we can maintain our market share hopefully even re-position our market share in some cases. We'll have to wait see exactly how the exchange shake out. 
Milton Johnson: Alright Jerry, thank you.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question from Joshua Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua Raskin: Hi thanks. Good morning, question around the outpatient surgery volumes, you know it became a little impatient this quarter and I think I heard it was -- curious maybe more specific on the surgery centers you know what you guys are saying in terms of volumes in any initiatives or anything specific in any of your markets that's causing that changing trend?
Milton Johnson: It actually is more on our historical trend, the first quarter was uniquely high we could put our fingers the way on exactly why it was this high it was, but the second quarter was more on our historical trend, and it was very balanced between our hospital towards surgery centers, our growth is fairly broad based across the different service lines in those centers and in our hospital, we have a number of initiatives are all are choice of initiatives continues to yield value for us, it is a satisfactory position and helping our patient flow patient satisfaction. Secondly, we are in an acquisition on inventory surgery centers and endoscopic centers and it added over the course of the last 12 to 18 months a quite a few additional units, and we look at our composite none things towards surgery center growth in the second quarter was about 1.5% which reflect some of the acquisition that we've done, we believe that it will be very strategic to position alignment, greater outreach in the commercial segment is just advancing larger network of offering HCAs market. So we're very pleased with the result with second quarter and we believe we still have opportunities to grow outpatient surgery volumes with our different initiatives. 
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.
Scott Fidel: Thanks, actually another thought question on the exchanges I know that already you asked about the volume outlook just interested if you can talk about on the reimbursement or the rate outlook with the payers whether you seen any sort of change in posture from them, in particular just interested on the blues on you know given all the losses that they've had and they come back and try to renegotiate the rates or you know you are not really seeing any changes on the exchange side?
Milton Johnson: Well, all of our contracts negotiations are a bit different depending on the market, depending on the circumstance but I mean in general that hasn't been any Dramatic changes in our contract -- I think a reimbursement per unit is in line with our expectations this year, and we anticipate that being the case for next year as well, so – I mean there are pockets here and there recently made an announcement about some challenges with their exchanges, we have a little bit of business what they have done in the exchanges, we tend to deal with the local state policy more than we do Texas, Florida, Tennessee, Kansas city places like that it so it's not really an issue as much as it is how the -- how the local policy, their pricing challenges and medical loss ratio issues and so forth, but in general for HCA there's not a lot of change. 
Operator: [Indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks, good morning I just wondered the guidance, if we look at just the mid-point it would call for out 5% EBITDA growth in the second half of the year verses that you know low twos you've had in the first half so I do not know do get easier given for the pressures in the third quarter but can you talk about maybe other areas that give you comfort around that growth just given the slowdown in the top line and then maybe some of the continued cost pressures, anything to consider seasonally high-tech dollars anything like that 5% growth? Thanks.
William Rutherford: Yes right, it implies that 5% growth to get to the mid-point, I think one of the major factor he touched on to get easier especially in the third quarter, last year we were a little bit solid so we should have a think will prompt for the third quarter, but you know when you look at our -- we have factors all the kinds of into our guidance and where we think we can achieve the outcome for the second half of the year. But I don't -- maybe a little bit of seasonality typically that we see in the second half of the year, the fourth quarter especially, that obviously a trend we see every year but nothing with high-tech or anything that would call out that would be outside of normal operations would be contributing to that -- to that expectation for growth in the second half of the year. Fourth quarter of last year was a big number for us, so as we revised our guidance, we think the midpoint range we're at is not reflective of what our current trends, but we're comfortable with that.
Milton Johnson: I will say one thing, too, that should help. It's on some of the contact library shoes that we dealt with in the second half of last year as Sam described. Although we still have opportunity to contact, it is moderating in terms of stable, in terms of where it is. We better relate in the second half of the year relative to the content contract label as well.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Andrew Shenker with Morgan Stanley.
Andy Shenker: I'm just wondering and talk a little bit more about the supply margins. Did you guys call the -- you've talked about continued supply chain initiative, but supplies as a percentage of revenues is pretty much declined almost every year for almost a decade now. How much more options are there that's really just continuing to push through better pricing given the GPO? Are there other strategic moves that can continue to drive this measure down or at least continue to slow the growth of supply versus everything else? Thank you.
Milton Johnson: Hi, Andy. Thank you. Will, you want to...
William Rutherford: Yes, let me take a first shot. As you know, supply costs us percent of revenue. Year-over-year we had 20 basis point declines. When I look at it for the past four quarter, we're pretty consistent, 16.7 in Q2, 16.7 in Q1, 16.4 in Q4, 16.7 in Q3. It's very sustainable and we do think that's accomplishment given the continued intensity increases in volume growth that we've seen over that time. Our supply chain team as well as our field operators have done an outstanding job from a variety of aspects around supply chain. First, relatively or GPO in contracting. We still have momentum in the marketplace with Health Trust Purchasing Group and that continued to have a lot of strong performance and then our supply chain operations are really a key component of our supply chain story. We've spoken recently at one of our recent initiatives around pharmacy consolidation where we can help control the pharmacy spending utilization of inventory. That is paying great dividends. It's that initiative is rolling through the marketplace. We've also got initiatives in the operating suites, as well as other initiatives around our performance improvement activity. When you couple supply chain initiatives operationally with the contracting statuses going on, I think that's all leading to us being with at least maintain our margins on a supply cost line and remain the stability. You'll do recall last year we did speak in the third quarter of some pharmacy cost elevation with our pharmacy cost per adjusted emission or adjust-to-patient day with elevated in the second and third quarter of last year, mainly due to some high cost drugs that obviously have a lot of press around that. We've seen those pharmacy cost trends moderate over the past couple of quarters in response to some of just the public pressure on those high cost drugs. That is also benefiting our year-over-year comparison.
Milton Johnson: Let me add one comment to that. I think it's about other area of opportunity for HCA. Our clinical data warehouse, the number of our quality initiatives have sort of supply cost utilization, drug utilization, bad practice identification and so forth attached to it. As we engage our positions more than we've done in the past, they're understanding of how it helps them, how it helps their facilities, how it helps their patients is another opportunity that I think we're in the early stages of execution on our supply costs. Married up with what Will just talked about on contracting supply chain operational management, coupled with data and insights connected to our positions is a very powerful combination that we think still had headwind.
Andy Shenker: All right.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Joanna Dodger: Good morning. This is actually Joanna Dodger filling in for Kevin. Just a quick question on your volume out of -- do you expect to be still slow and -- but for Dan, can you also comment on the pricing out? Because it seems like the first two quarters also are coming in towards the lower end of the guidance that you provide us for that full year, but at the same time it seems like at the same store increases have been pretty solid. Any color on pricing you might give? Thank you.
Milton Johnson: Joanna, thanks to you.
William Rutherford: I'll start in that. When we gave her guidance, we anticipated our revenue per adjusted emission to be 2% to 3%. Year-to-date, we're at 2.1%. We reported that number in the second quarter. When I look at a longer term view, that's right in range. We've had some quarters a little more to that, some within range. Sam talked about our visibility of our contracting for 2017 and 2018 for pretty consistent terms. So when we look at pricing measured by a revenue for adjusted emission, it's within our range and I think within our trend that we've seen over the past four to six quarters.
Milton Johnson: I would add that in the second quarter, it probably wasn't as strong because of payer mix with this commercial volume being down a bit. Obviously, that's -- and in the delta there can create a little bit of a boarding if you will, making positive number. But within our commercial book like where we thought we would be and actually a bit better. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.
Gary Taylor: Hi, good morning. I had a couple clarifications and then my real question. Just the first clarification, is it does look like Bill, year-to-date, you're favoring discounts over bad debts at least versus kind of a seasonality in the first half. I know the total write-off looked fine. But I just wondered if there was any policy-change or anything that was driving the much slower bad debt number that obviously is offset by the higher charity discount?
William Rutherford: I'll take down, Gary. No policy changes relative to our recognition. In any period, they're sometimes subject for news between non-insured discounts charity and bad debt. Bad debt in second quarter is very consistent with our Q1, but really no year-over-year changes and that's why I think it's best to look at the portfolio including all three of those and that's why they're consistent. But no changes. Again, at any period, you're subject to maybe some of that in your uninsured discount line versus bad debt, but not policy changes related to that.
Milton Johnson: Gary, you're pretty clever; two clarifications in one question. I think that's story. I'm going to give you points than not.
Gary Taylor: The last part of it, Sam was talking about labor cost trends. I saw it and I didn't know if any of that included any anticipated impact from the new overtime rules in December as that goes in the 2017. Does that create a view that...
Milton Johnson: The overtime rule for us are very immaterial and present not even…
Gary Taylor: Okay. Then my real question, your comments on the new cardiac bundle and what your approach has been with orthopedic bundle. Are you just contracting with besting [indiscernible] providers in your market and this will be a capital light investment to coordinate the risk that you're assuming there? Just your comments on how you'll approach me?
William Rutherford: Well, I think on the -- varies by market a bit. We are trying to work with our physicians to identify the best course of action for our patients whether that's the type of -- how we interact with them from the hospital and so forth. It's very, very early in understanding how impactful those are. As we transition, we just got the rags on the cardiac thing, it's 700 plus pages of rags I think. We haven't got a chance to study that yet. I think one new launch for us with cardiology versus orthopedic we employ large number of cardiologists across HCA and our ability to integrate with them may be a bit easier than it is in some respects with orthopedics, which we don't employ as much. We'll just have to wait and see how that plays out. That's still a proposed rule. We don't know if its impact will go into effect and what the final rules will be on the cardiac side. We're prepared, we've invested in infrastructure, corporate offers in our divisions, we've educated, we've put policies and procedures in place on a CJR. We'll hopefully see where it goes over the next 12-18 months.
Milton Johnson: Gary, thank you. All right, shot clock home. We got time for about two or three questions.
Operator: Next we'll go to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.
Ana Gupte: Yes, hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the managed care and generally the industry trend around moving to lower cost service. So when you have 1.5% or something outpatient surgery, the inpatient is in the same range. Can you give us some color on the breakdown between the freestanding clinic and versus the outpatient department, and what the price distinction is, and how much of a volume increase do you need to overcome the price difference and if that won't -- in addition to the mix with government putting pressure on your prices.
Milton Johnson: I'm not prepared to give pricing between the two units. I mean, it's ASCs are a bit less priced -- lower priced than our hospitals. And that's because of some of the infrastructure requirements that it takes to operate a hospital base here, and capital requirements are different, and so forth. Both components have about 50% to 55% of their volume in commercial patients. So outpatient business is predominantly a commercial booking business. A number of our surgery centers have broader clinical capabilities and can provide the type of care that our hospital base units, but others can't. They don't have the nursing, they don't have the backup, the physicians aren't comfortable operating on certain types of patients and so forth. So there's all these nuances that go into it. Ambulatory surgery centers have been in our market for a decade, and this dynamic has always existed. So we've got the right balanced approach, we believe, inside of HCA, to be able to respond to respond to physician needs, patient needs, payer needs, with our network and we continue to add to both.
Ana Gupte: Thank you. That was helpful.
Operator: Let's go to Sarah James of Wedbush Securities.
Sarah James: Thanks. You've been focused on growing the ASC footprint and about the commitment to investing in outpatient. So if we take a step back and look at where you're putting capital to work, how do you see the acuity mix or mix of inpatient/outpatient changing for HCA over the next five to ten years?
Milton Johnson: Wow. I'll say this: Fundamentally, the Company has a strategy to enhance the clinical complexion of our facilities. And by that, I mean advancing into deeper capabilities. In many markets, we are adding the service lines I'll call horizontally where we bring on new capabilities in cardiovascular care, oncology, pediatrics, whatever. And then vertically, we're deepening those capabilities inside of existing service lines. All intended on being able to keep a patient somewhere in the HCA system if they need deeper care or more complex care. So we import that out of our Clinical Services group and out of our service line group up here in Nashville, where we can bring technology, we can bring best practices, we can bring a specialized talent to support that. So when I view the Company's inpatient business, I anticipate it getting more acute and more complex over time. On the outpatient side, the Company has had a very aggressive investment strategy over the last number of years. I think, Bill, our outpatient revenues are pushing 40% of our total. And so we balance out the $2.7 billion between inpatient capacity, outpatient surgical capacity, imaging capacity, clinical capacity for urgent care, and then also for Emergency Room, which is a big piece of our outpatient strategy as well. So all of those pieces and parts are connected to really a balanced approach to building out our network and being attractive to our patients and our physicians. All right, thank you, Sarah. It's 9:59. One more question.
Operator: Okay, we'll take our last question from Sheryl Skolnick from Misuho, a follow-up.
Sheryl Skolnick: Very kind of you. So it dovetails on what Sam was just talking about. You've made significant investments in big data and it's highly sophisticated. Obviously, this plays into all of what you're doing. But at some point, maybe this is too long a question to ask call. But at some point, can you help us understand how the improvements you're making in the quality of care, the outcomes, the lives saved, and the changes you're making to the process will enable you to support higher volumes and better profits in the future?
Milton Johnson: Well, Sheryl, you've hit on a subject that I think is very important to healthcare over the next five to ten years and thereafter. We're investing -- we now invest very heavily in that because we see it as, I'll call it a game changer for the healthcare. This is an area where I want to see HCA lead. And I'm very excited about the early returns and what we're seeing, again, we've invested in the central data warehouse. If you think about what's happened over the last several years with electronic health records and investments that HCA and other providers have made in moving now to a digital medical record, it's not like stealth one; now we have all this clinical information in a digital format, and what do we do with it? And there's a lot we can do with it. I'm going to ask Dr. Perlman to touch on a couple, but some things that we're doing around acceptance care and really dropping mortality rates in our hospitals from sepsis and saving lives. It's really happening; it's happening today in our facilities. And so there's examples like that. So it's, again, we're investing in not only in terms of the technical side of that but the human resource side of that with hiring very talented data scientists to help us take advantage of this. And then you think you move on from the structured data that we have to the unstructured data, and that's a language processing and, where we can move the needle there is, again, something for the future that I'm very excited about. Dr. Perlman's here John, why don't you give more detail on that area?
John Perlman: Thanks, Milton. And that's -- we're really at the point where we can begin to realize what we consider a digital dividend of the -- I mean, each day HCA has always been very operations- and science-driven in its business decisions. Every aspect of our clinical care can be captured and we can understand better, try better clinical and operational and business decisions. Bill mentioned Detroit, the gateway into improving care for patients in real time in terms of the ability to capture and even predict a lot of calls are done from the country, number 9 in the hospital, number 3 in ITOs. It really allows us to do save lives. In that process, it also allows us to drive our processes more efficiently in terms of labor, in terms of the resources used to provide care, the supplies. It arms our MDs and caretakers with the ability to answer questions and drive our clinical integration forward in a science-driven fashion as Sam alluded to, which is really a requisite for maximizing rate reimbursement. It really is a predicate for success in bundled stock in the future. It's kind of like the doorway to really personalized dynamic precision medicine. So it's really our mechanism to channel back the inevitable data stream and results from what we do to provide healthcare and use it to drive better clinical operations decisions.
Milton Johnson: All right, Sheryl. And everyone thank you very much for your time this morning, we appreciate it. We look forward to following up with all of you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.

I'll make a few comments on the quarter, and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more details on the quarter's results. We are pleased with the results in the first quarter which are in line with our internal expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.003 billion for the first quarter, increased 2.1% over prior year. As expected, the first quarter of this year was a difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2015 when adjusted EBITDA grew 19.3% over the first quarter of 2014. Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., increased 17.3%, and earnings per share increased 24.3% for the quarter. As noted in our release this morning, net income, EPS and cash flows from operations were favorably impacted by an accounting change we adopted related to share-based compensation, which lowered our tax rate for the quarter. Our 2016 guidance remains unchanged, except for adjusted EPS which has been increased by $0.20 per diluted share on both the low and the high end of the range. This is to reflect the tax benefit recorded during the first quarter of 2016 related to the accounting change made in this first quarter. We have not attempted to estimate the impact of this accounting change on future quarters of 2016, as the tax benefit depends upon the number of equity awards settled each period, and the market value of our stock at the time of settlement. We continue to experience solid growth in inpatient and outpatient volumes as well as surgical and emergency room visits. We believe these results speak the quality of our markets, and the execution of our strategic agenda. Same facility admissions increased 1.6% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.1%. Our growth drivers include capital improvements, programmatic developments within our service lines, end market access point development and strategic acquisitions. This year we plan to invest $2.7 billion to expand our service capabilities and capacity in our markets. In 2016, approximately 350 new inpatient beds and 100 new ER beds will come online, with another 550 inpatient beds and 200 ER beds scheduled for completion in 2017. We continue to see solid growth from our investments into service line development such as trauma, cardiology, rehab and (4:58) services. Our strategy to expand our access points in our markets is providing growth opportunities to inpatient and outpatient services. The effective execution of our growth agenda is yielding market share gains, and Sam will provide additional details in a moment. With respect to supply expense we continue to see solid execution of our initiatives to manage our supply costs. We are pleased with the early results of our integration of Tenet Healthcare into HealthTrust Purchasing Group. And clearly, one of the highlights of the quarter is the strong growth in cash flows from operations, up 37.4% over last year's first quarter. The quarter reflects our balanced approach to capital allocation. During the quarter we generated almost $1.4 billion in cash flows from operations, and we deployed $509 million to capital expenditures, and $621 million to repurchase 8.921 million shares of our stock. And we had $1.983 billion remaining on our $3 billion share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. Finally, let me recognize Don Stinnett, HCA's, Senior Vice President and Controller who retired at the end of April. We thank Don for his 17 years of service, and the many contributions he's made to our company. I'd also like to welcome Chris Wyatt who has succeeded Don as Senior Vice President and Controller. Chris most recently served as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of HCA Information Technology and Services organization. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Milton indicated, we had a solid quarter that was driven by good volume growth and our adjusted EBITDA results were in line with our expectations. Let me give you some more detail on our performance and the results for the quarter. As we reported, in the first quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year, and same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.1%. Sam will provide more color on the drivers of this volume in a moment, but I'll give you some trends by (7:08) During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.8% and 2.1%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 3.1% on a same facility basis, and now represent 33% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.4% and 4.3%, respectively, in the quarter, in line with our recent trends. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 10.6% in the quarter, while equivalent admissions increased 9.4%. These represent 6.9% of our total admissions compared to 6.3% last year. There are a couple of points on our uninsured volume I'd like to call out. First, our uninsured same facility admissions in our expansion states were flat year-over-year, while our non-expansion states grew just over 11%. Texas and Florida represent about 70% of our total uninsured admissions, and represent 90% of the year-over-year growth. And to put this uninsured growth into perspective, the 10.6% growth we saw in the quarter equates to just over 3,000 admissions for the company, compared to the 477,000 same facility admissions we have for the quarter. Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 1.5%, and equivalent admissions increased 2.7% on a same facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 6.9% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 18.6% of our total ER visits in the first quarter for both 2016 and 2015. Intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter, with our same facility case mix increasing 2.7% compared to the prior-year period. Same facility surgeries increased 3.3% in the quarter, with inpatient surgeries increasing 1.4%, and outpatient surgeries increasing 4.4% from the prior year. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.2% in the quarter. Our outpatient revenues in the first quarter continued to show very strong growth. Outpatient revenues in the quarter represented 38.9% of total revenues, up 120 basis points from prior year's first quarter. Same facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.9% in the quarter. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $618 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $951 million in the quarter, an increase of $63 million from the prior-year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $3.076 billion, an increase of $555 million over the prior-year period. Now turning to expenses. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.8% compared to last year's first quarter. On a consolidated basis, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue was 45.8%, compared to 45.5% in last year's first quarter, and 45.7% for the full year of 2015. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.8% in the quarter on a same facility basis. Productivity, as measured by same facility man-hours per adjusted admission, improved 0.5%, and same facility wage rates increased 2.5% in the quarter. Supply expense as a percent of revenues, were 16.7% this quarter as compared to 16.9% in last year's first quarter, on a consolidated basis. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased from 1.4% for the first quarter compared to the prior-year period, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives. Other operating expenses increased 40 basis points from last year's first quarter to 18.1% of revenues, and was consistent with the 18% we ran in Q4 of 2015, and 18.2% in Q3 of 2015. We recognized $4 million of electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $19 million last year, consistent with our expectations. Let me briefly touch on cash flow. As Milton mentioned, we had another extremely strong quarter, with cash flow from operations just under $1.4 billion, about a $380 million improvement. Cash flow from operations was benefited by $74 million due to the adoption of new accounting standard that I will discuss in a minute. Free cash flow increased $339 million, from $440 million in Q1 of 2015 to $779 million in Q1 of 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.9 billion available under our revolving credit facilities, and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.84 times at March 31, 2016 compared to 3.85 times at the end of 2015. Let me touch briefly on health reform. Health reform activity continued to grow in the quarter. In the first quarter, we saw approximately 12,500 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 9,860 we saw in the first quarter of last year, or about a 27% increase. You may recall, we saw about 11,200 same facility exchange admissions in the fourth quarter of 2015, or 11% increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter. We believe this is largely due to the minimum enrollment (13:27) For perspective, exchange admissions represent about 2.6% of total admissions for the company. We saw approximately 50,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the first quarter compared to the approximate 37,000 visits in the first quarter of 2015 and 38,000 visits in the fourth quarter of 2015. Overall, our exchange and reform activity is in line with our expectations. Lastly, as mentioned in the release, the company did elect to early adopt a new accounting standard FASB ASU 2016-09, which was issued in late March. This standard simplifies certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. In summary, the standard requires the excess tax benefits related to equity award settlements will be recorded as a component to the provision for income taxes prospectively, versus previously these amounts were recorded directly at equity. In the quarter, we recorded $74 million tax benefit, or $0.18 per diluted share related to this adoption. Also, these tax benefit amounts were previously presented as cash flow from financing activities, but are now reflected as cash flows from operating activities. So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: Good morning. As mentioned earlier, the first quarter was another solid quarter of volume growth for the company. The company continued to show broad-based growth across our markets, and broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. There were a number of factors that impacted our inpatient admissions and outpatient volumes this quarter. First, flu admissions were down by 40%, which affected our overall inpatient admission growth rate by 0.6%. And then secondly, leap year positively affected our inpatient admissions by approximately 1%. But this calendar effect was partially offset by the Easter holidays which were in March this year. We believe the net impact of all these factors had an immaterial effect on overall volumes. For our domestic operations, on a same facility basis, 11 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions, 14 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions, and 13 of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits. The company had a total of 56 freestanding emergency rooms at the end of March. We had 44 last year at this time. Freestanding emergency room visits grew 31% and accounted for approximately one-third of our overall growth in visits. Hospital-based emergency room visits grew 5%. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of provider networks in 42 domestic markets, most of which, we believe, still have good growth prospects. In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified facility base and service line was equally strong. For domestic operations on a same facility basis, inpatient surgeries grew by 1.8%, which increased surgical admits to 27.6% of total admits in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points. Surgical volumes were particularly strong in cardiovascular, orthopedic and general surgery categories. Outpatient surgeries grew by 4.6%. Both components of this service line, hospital-based and our freestanding ambulatory division had equally strong growth. Also same facility outpatient endoscopic and pain procedures grew by 1.6%. The company continues, strategically, to add freestanding ambulatory, endoscopic and pain centers to its provider networks. As compared to the first quarter of last year, we have acquired or developed nine new centers, and closed or sold four for a net of five more, bringing our total to 131 centers. Including these new centers, the company's total outpatient surgery volumes grew 6.3% and outpatient endoscopic and pain procedures were up 6.7%. Behavioral health admissions grew 2.7%, rehab admissions grew 2.8%. Deliveries were flat in the quarter, however, managed deliveries were up 4.4%. Neonatal admissions grew 4.7%, but our length of stay declined because of less acuity this quarter, which impacted our patient day growth in this service line. Overall, average length of stay increased 0.5%, which was driven mainly by the growth in our acuity or case mix index. We believe our efforts in developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks are driving this increase. Other volume statistics for the quarter are as follows. Cardiology procedure volumes grew approximately 5%, trauma volumes grew 27%, observation visits were up 13%, and finally the company's urgent care visits in total grew 22%. The company had 68 urgent care centers at the end of March this year, up from 50 last year. The inpatient market share data for the 12 months ended September 2015 shows that HCA continued to gain share, and our composite share of 24.6% was at its highest level in the past five years. We believe our comprehensive growth agenda, which is both well-resourced and well executed, provides further opportunities for the company to increase market share and drive revenue growth. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thanks, Sam. Stephanie, if you will come back on and poll for questions, and we would encourage folks to ask only one question, so we can get everybody covered.
Operator: Thank you. We will go first to Sheryl Skolnick with Mizuho Securities.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: (20:07) So in this quarter, and in previous quarters that you've experienced increases in uninsured volumes, some folks have been focusing on bad debt, and so while I hate to ask the question, I have to ask the question because I know it's on the minds of many. So the fundamental question is, how worried should we be about the increment that we see in your bad debt ratio in this quarter? That's number one. Number two, can you give us an estimate of the impact of the treatment of these patients on the EBITDA performance? And whether that might be a reflection of the difference between this year's in line performance versus last year's strong outperformance? And third, can you give us a sense of whether or not that increase that you experienced was anticipated by you, or whether you're gaining market share and adding ERs may have led to a slightly higher than anticipated increase in uninsured services?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Sheryl, thank you. Bill do you want to take that?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Sheryl, good morning. Let me try to address most of your points. When I look at the bad debts, and as you know, for HCA, I think we have to look at the total uncompensated care picture, which includes charity as well as the uninsured discounts. When I look at our total uncompensated care trends, those trends are pretty consistent with our recent experience. When I look at it as a percent of adjusted revenue, it was 32% for the quarter, 32.6% in the fourth quarter, 33% a little high in the third quarter, 30.7% in the first and 29.6% in the first. (22:00) So our trends are pretty consistent, and I would tell you we're pretty much in line with what we had internally projected. As we've said, I believe the uninsured volume will be driven by our emergency room volume. Our emergency room uninsured ED visits were up 26,000 compared to our 3,000 or so uninsured growth, you see that's a 12% in net rate, which is pretty consistent with what we've historically seen. And then as I mentioned in my comments, it's driven by Florida and Texas. Obviously two non-expansion states that we continue to see. So I had anticipated our uninsured trends to kind of settle out around that high single digit level. I think it will be really settling where our ED visits land. The EBITDA impact is really marginal. As we talked, the EBITDA impact is the marginal cost that we have for that, so I don't think that really contributed materially to the EBITDA issues for the quarter for the company.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sam, did you have anything? All right. Sheryl, thank you.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We go now to A.J. Rice with UBS.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, everybody. I might just ask one technical question and then a broader question. Just on the technical one, you were very active in the buybacks in the quarter. What should we think of in terms of ongoing buybacks? And is there any update on what you did so far? But my broader question is with the consolidation for the managed care guys pending, and with a lot of discussion about various incentive payments on part of managed care guys with providers, either positive incentives or putting price at risk. Are you seeing any change in contracting behavior as you look out over the next year or two? And what percentage of your contracts are sort of locked up? And any color on what you're seeing there?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Milton, do you want to take number one? And maybe Sam on two?
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Well, as I mentioned in my comments, at the end of the quarter, we had just under $2 billion remaining on our share repurchase, $1.983 billion. But I'm going to give you an update, through yesterday, at close of market activity, our remaining authorization is $1.708 billion, so just over $1.7 billion remaining. So we have been active since the end of the quarter. Obviously, we'll go into an open period here shortly – by tomorrow, and so we're evaluating our purchasing patterns as we go through the next several weeks. But we have remained active in the market since the end of the first quarter, A.J.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Great.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sam or, Bill. Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: On the managed care front, I think the general comment is this. The pricing environment is generally consistent across most of our markets with what we've seen over the past 24 months to 36 months. There are some nuances from one market to the other, with one contractor or the other, where we have to adjust the structural pieces of the contract, but again, those are more on the fringe than in the core aspects of the contract. For the company, we're largely contracted for all of 2016, as we indicated in our guidance. We're about 70% contracted in 2017, and about 45% contracted for 2018. And in general, the pricing escalation and the structural aspects of those contracts are pretty much consistent with what we've seen in the past 24 months or 36 months. We don't believe that the consolidation across our 42 markets of the payers is going to have a global impact on HCA. We think, if those particular mergers are consummated, that in some market, they could have some nuanced impact, but again, we don't see that as a material change in what's going on in the marketplace.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go now to Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Wanted to concentrate on the divergence in growth rates on your surgeries, inpatient versus outpatient. I'm trying to figure out how much of that is patient preference or physician movement, relative to how much of that is HCA initiatives around growth in your surgery centers, and your specific initiatives to do that? I guess, trying to figure out how much of that is intentional, versus how much of that is just market driven?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right, Sam, you want...
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: Well, we have a very robust surgical growth initiative in general across the company, and we call it our OR of choice initiatives, where we are very sensitive to physician issues, patient issues, scheduling issues and so forth. We've been very aggressive with our equipment investment, and that has application across both the inpatient and outpatient. On the inpatient side, the inpatient surgeries tend to be more connected to our approach in driving more complex care: trauma care, burn care, deeper capabilities in orthopedics and neurosciences. And so those are a little slower moving, I would say, in general, although our inpatient surgery growth has been very steady over the last three-and-a-half years, where we've seen pretty consistent growth, I'm counting up the quarters as I look here, almost 11 straight quarters of inpatient surgical growth across HCA. On the outpatient side, we again are seeing demand growth in outpatient surgery, and we try to create two venues for patients and physicians to operate. One being freestanding ambulatory surgery centers, where again, we've added to our portfolio over the past few years, and we have efforts to grow those particular centers. And then within our hospitals, where we have physicians who like to do inpatient cases, they also tend to want to do their outpatient cases on the same days, and so we're trying to accommodate them as well. But in total, our outpatient surgeries have grown very consistently over the same 12 quarters, 13 quarters, with a little bit of acceleration in this first quarter. And I can't really point to why it accelerated in the first quarter as compared to the trend. But our efforts are broad-based. We have a number of initiatives, including capital investments, that are intended to drive surgical activity across the three areas of our business: inpatient, ambulatory surgery and then hospital-based outpatient.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Josh, thank you.
Operator: We'll go now to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning. You talked about labor productivity, but I didn't hear any mention of contract labor. Could you tell us kind of how contract labor trends ran relative to a year ago in recent quarters? And then also could you provide a comment on the recent Florida legislation on balance billing and out-of-network? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sam, you are up again.
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: For labor, we were pleased with the results for labor in the first quarter, and we were pleased in particular when you look at it sequentially against the fourth quarter of 2015 where we had 3.5% productivity improvement from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, which represents about a 75% flex rate, if you want to call it that, on the incremental volume that we saw from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Now, in the first quarter we have to pay more payroll taxes, more unemployment insureds and so forth, so our total spend was up about $122 million because of benefit costs, natural growth that occurs first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Compared to last year we did have a slight margin erosion. Two factors drove that. Share-based comp being a piece of that, and then a moderated growth in contract labor being the other piece. Contract labor for the company has run the same amount of dollars over the last three quarters now. So the first quarter did not see any growth in total spend compared to the fourth quarter, which was consistent with the third quarter, so we've seen some stabilization. We believe that our efforts around this particular area presents an opportunity for HCA in the future. If we can stem some of the nursing turnover that we have experienced and improve our retention efforts, and we have a number of initiatives to deal with that, we think we can drive some incremental improvements over time in this particular area. So all in all, the productivity and the results from a labor standpoint for HCA in the quarter were well managed, we believe, when you look at it compared to where we were in the fourth quarter. With respect to the balance billing issue in Florida, we're not thinking that's going to create a lot of issues for us one way or the other. We believe for our patients it's going to be beneficial and that it will eliminate in many instances potential surprise billings around certain hospital-based physician providers. But for us and our approach to the market and our relationships with our physician contract companies, we're not anticipating any kind of impact from the balance billing legislation in Florida.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Frank, thank you.
Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go now to Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I feel like you guys have a lot underway behind-the-scenes with HPG and I sense that there's some momentum in some areas like pharmacy and distribution centers, and how you're aligning the pharmacists with the supply chain decisions. Just any comments around these initiatives would be helpful.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'll take that one (32:22) And you're right, we have a lot of momentum inside the HealthTrust Purchasing Group, not only with activities with our members, as Milton said with the Tenet integrations and some others that they are very integrated with us from an operational standpoint and have been for over 10 years from managing our distribution centers, accounts payable, and we have some recent initiatives there that we still become very encouraged with. One of them is what we refer to as a pharmacy consolidation initiative that we have going on throughout the markets in HCA where we consolidate the pharmacy supply chain as well as the pharmacy distribution chain, and embed pharmacists in there to work with our clinicians on the floor to ensure that the prescriptions in our pharmacy utilization is optimized on there. In addition, it helps us with the procurement of pharmacy and looking at the storage and inventory on there. So it's just one more initiative that we have going on. They're embedded in our operating rooms to help us manage our inventories, supply chain within the operating rooms as well as many other distribution efforts. So the overall HPG from one aggregated spend on the GPO as well as operational initiatives, I think continue to deliver a lot of value to HCA and its members.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Milt, do you want to add something?
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'll just add with respect to HPG. I mean, it continues to grow. We're very pleased with the growth in terms of purchasing power. Being a GPO (33:54) a major piece of the leverage is purchasing power. I think for 2016 HPG will probably hit somewhere in the $27 billion to $28 billion range in terms of purchasing power across all of the membership, and again, that's a committed compliance model, and I think that will allow us to continue not only focus on improving operational results with better supply chain management, but also continue to achieve a better pricing from vendors as a result of being able to do (34:20) market share to them.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thanks (34:24)
Operator: We'll go now to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Question on the psych and the rehab volumes. The numbers were, I guess, pretty solid numbers but really sharply down over where they'd been the last few years. Just wanted to see if there was anything going on there as far as how you were spending your capital. And I guess thoughts about the IMD exclusion, whether that makes you think differently about how you pursue psych volumes, whether you'd want to outsource that or actually build freestanding sites to take advantage of that.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: In total, behavioral health admissions were off the trend at 2.7%. They've been trending in the upper single digits. I think for the most part, we had three facilities out of our 58 facilities that were down significantly. And when you looked at the other 55 facilities, they were actually on trend. So we had a challenge or two at two facilities, three facilities rather, that created the composite problem for the company. There is no change in our strategy. We continue to invest in behavioral health capacity, and we have a lot of demand for that. We've recently approved some expansion of behavioral health capabilities in a number of markets to deal with that. In some instances, we have struggled with psychiatrists in the supply physician coverage, and that's been more the barrier to growth than actual capacity. But behavioral health continues to be a very important component and service line for our market strategy as well as a complement to our emergency room service line strategy. On the rehab side, again, we did see a little bit of volume growth that was off trend. Rehab was more in the upper single digits as well. Again, no significant change across the company with respect to capital investment or focus on that particular service line. It was unusually soft in the first quarter. Again, a couple of hospitals explain some of that. We have seen in a few markets where we've some bundled pilots that it's had a marginal impact. But all in all, that continues to be a very strong service line. We have investments going forward into that particular service line where we're adding capacity. And again, it complements very important service lines for HCA like neurosciences, trauma and burn and service lines like that. So we see opportunities for growth in that one as well.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Well, if anybody want to address the IMD exclusion. Bill?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. We don't think it's going to have any material impact on HCA. The majority of our behavioral health is still sourced from our emergency rooms. So again, I think as Sam said, I don't think that changes our strategy at all going forward.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thanks Kevin.
Operator: We'll go now to Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.
Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. I just want to talk a little bit more about the other operating expense line. It was certainly higher than we expected. I appreciate that it was roughly consistent with second half 2015 numbers, but it certainly was up 40 basis points year-over-year. And historically, it's usually stepped down or been flat year-over-year. It actually stepped up sequentially rather. What was behind that increase? And based on your comments around 2H, should be thinking of 18.1% really as the new run rate, or was there something particularly high in the quarter? Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: Well, let me say that other operating expenses, generally, stay about the same from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. We did see a little bit of a trend change last year where it actually trended down a bit in the first quarter. But in general, when I look back over three years, four years, it stayed about the same and that's what we saw this year. The fourth quarter and the first quarter were almost identical. But when you look at it compared to the first quarter of last year, the execution of our service line initiatives, primarily trauma and then secondarily, graduate medical education, is driving professional fee expense growth for the company. We saw some deterioration in margin, primarily because of professional fee expense. And there were three things that drove that. First, we did an acquisition of a physician network in Northern California last year, where most of the costs of that particular acquisition are in other expenses. And that drove a piece of the margin erosion. The second piece and probably the more important piece and more connected to the company's strategy is around trauma program development, where we have to invest in professional fees to support our trauma programs. And again, we've added significant amount of trauma programs, some are in their early stage startup modes, so you see a little bit of a disproportionate load of other operating expenses as a result. And then the third piece was in our graduate medical education programs, where we've added graduate medical education programs for residents and so forth at a number of our facilities which required some level of professional fees for faculties and such so that we can support those programs. All in all, we think there will be some growth in these numbers over the remaining portion of the year, but not in any way where it changes our trend and our expectation on the margin levels that Bill laid out. If you look at some of our components, like our ER physician call per ER visit, or ER call pay-per-ER-visit, those are generally in line with what we expected, slightly up, again, because of these program changes. So that's the biggest driver of our other expenses on a year-over-year, but it's very consistent, like Bill said, with the fourth quarter and even the third quarter, so the run rate is really not that materially changed.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Andy, thanks. Thanks Sam.
Operator: We'll go now to Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. I had a question just on the exchange volumes, and recognizing that it's still a small piece of the overall business. Just interested if, in terms of the year-over-year, and even in terms of some of the sequential volume increases, whether you've observed any type of rising case mix or acuity on those types of admissions from the exchange patients?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Bill?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Scott, thanks. Actually on our exchange business is staying really consistent, if you look at the mix, the case mix index, or the acuity of what we were running in 2015, and for that matter even in 2014. So as you know, we look at a variety of characteristics of that change volume, source of admission, surgical medical mix, and it's staying relatively consistent in 2016, is the best way to describe that. As I said in my comments, we are seeing growth – continued growth in reform, and I think that's largely attributable to the new enrollment that we saw this year starting in January, and so, with any hope, continue to see that growing going forward. But in terms of the mix of the exchange volume and the characteristics, very comparable in 2016 compared to what it was in 2015.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thanks, Scott.
Operator: We'll go now to Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Sam, you talked about the freestanding EDs as driving 30%-plus of the growth in the ER space, so do you mind just sharing with us what your growth plans are for that side of your business? And then, what do you see in terms of acuity levels in freestanding EDs, and are we seeing a change in how people use ERs in the markets where you're opening these facilities?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: Like I said, we have 56 freestanding emergency rooms today, that's up from 44 last year at this time. I think next year at this time, we will probably be somewhere between – depending on how quickly we get these up – 10 to 12 freestanding emergency rooms more as well. So our pipeline on development of these freestanding emergency rooms is still fairly strong. We should be somewhere around 70 freestanding emergency rooms, I think, in the next 12 months to 18 months. The acuity level tends to be a bit lower than what you see in a hospital-based emergency room, for a couple of reasons. One, obviously trauma cases aren't going to a freestanding emergency room, certain chest pain events are not going to a freestanding emergency room, nor are stroke events. So you have a natural tendency for the more acute patients, which are delivered by ambulance, to go to a hospital base because it's highly likely that they will be admitted. I think the freestanding emergency room plays a very important part in our network development; it plays a very important part in our outreach to consumers, to make it easy for them to access the system. I don't know that the ER as a venue, if you will, is changing in any significant way. I do believe, though, that urgent care and emergency rooms over the past three years to five years, and I think this will be the case going forward, is still a substitute for the shortages of primary care physicians that exist in a lot of markets. And so you see urgent care, freestanding emergency rooms, and even hospital-based emergency rooms, providing the solution that patients are looking for when they can't get into a physician clinic because of physician shortages, or because of payer dynamics. So from that standpoint, that probably structurally stays in place and we think it's part, in part – part of the reason for the overall demand growth that we've seen over the past few years in emergency room visit volume, and we think that will continue in the near-term.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Thanks, Sam.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Brian, thank you. Stephanie, we've got time for probably two more questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go now to Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Thank you. I'm sorry if this is already something you can calculate from the numbers you provided, but can you back out the – give us the managed care admissions and adjusted admissions excluding the exchange lives? And I'm not saying that that's the right way to look at it, I'm just wondering if you have that that you can share with us.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Bill, I don't know whether you have that or not?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We can give that. I'll qualify that a large portion of our exchange business is coming from previously insured, so it's skewed, and that's why we include the exchanges in that number. It looks like on our managed and other, if you exclude exchange is up about 1% on adjusted admissions.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, instead of 2.7%. Yeah, okay.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, so let me ask you, based on what you've seen, is it your conjecture that there has been substantial growth in the exchange enrollment from the previously uninsured, or does it look more or like mix shift? And I know you can't give an exact answer, I'm just curious if you have an off-the-cuff?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think it's probably more mix. I would not say that we're seeing substantial changes in the exchanges coming from previously insured. As we reported last year, historically in the exchanges in the first couple of years about 40% of that exchange volume is newly insured and 60% was coming from previously insured. My sense is those trends are staying relatively the same, so I really don't see there's dramatic shifts in that aspect of that that obviously would be in year three. The current year exchange volume was also probably an exchange patient last year, too. So that's changing a little bit. But I would say that growth is just more continued market share and mix shift changes that we're seeing.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thank you, Matt. One more question, Stephanie.
Operator: We'll take our final question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hi. Good morning. Just on the operating cash flow, I think you previously said you expected around $5 billion. Given the quarterly results, do you see that going higher? And then just on the CapEx, when we look at $2.7 billion, can you give us a sense for how much of that is going towards just real basic maintenance CapEx versus growth things like the freestanding ERs? Thanks a lot.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right, guys?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Look, I'll start. So right now, I think about $5 billion of cash flow from operations we're still – that's what we're projecting right now. There are some quarter-by-quarter fluctuations that may occur, but right now, we still think that's a good plane number. On our capital deployment of $2.7 billion, we said there's about $250 million of that of IT, roughly 40% or so are routine, and then 50% to 60% in terms of growth capital deployment. And as Milt said in his comments, that's spread among program development, access points and building new capacity. So when you take IT and routine, it's roughly 45% or so of our total capital, and the balance being growth capital deployment.
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, and let me add – this is Sam. Let me add one thing to what Bill just said. I think HCA has a very diversified capital allocation strategy in general, but specifically to our capital expenditure allocation strategy, it too is diversified across markets, across service lines and across different kinds of facility base, and that creates a very conservative confident level of allocation for the company, in my opinion.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Chris, thank you very much.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: And I think with that, we'll call it a day. Mark is here, so we look forward to seeing some of you at the conferences that are coming up, and you all have a good day.
Operator: This concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the HCA Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Audrey, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would both like to welcome everyone on today's call and to those of you who are listening on our webcast. With me here this morning: Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectation. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and are included in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses, gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claim costs which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's fourth quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded. A replay will be available later today. With that, let me turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or webcast. This morning, we issued our full quarterly earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2015. The release is consistent with the preview of the fourth quarter we issued earlier this month. And I'll make a few comments on the quarter and our strategy, and then I'll turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more detail on the quarter, health reform and 2016 expectations. We were extremely pleased with the results of the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter totaled $2.131 billion and, for the year, $7.915 billion. It was a record earnings quarter for HCA and also a record earnings year. The fourth quarter performance was a result of solid volume growth, improved payer mix and service mix and effective cost management. We believe the company is well positioned for continued success. There are many aspects of the company that contribute to our consistency of growth and financial performance. Our growth strategy built upon our investments in developing health systems in large, fast-growing urban markets has been delivering strong top line growth. To illustrate the consistency and effectiveness of our growth strategy, we have reported same facility admissions and adjusted admissions growth for eight consecutive years, ER visit growth for nine consecutive years and surgical growth for seven consecutive quarters. We believe our strategies are well resourced and we expect to see another year of volume growth in 2016. The consistent execution of our growth strategy and consistent growth in adjusted EBITDA, which has grown from $5.9 billion in 2010 to $7.9 billion in 2015, has resulted in strong cash flows. Since our IPO in early 2011, we have maintained a well-balanced shareholder-friendly approach to capital allocation. For example, since the IPO in 2011 through the fourth quarter of 2015, we have generated $20.1 billion of cash flows from operating activities. Over the same period, we invested $9.7 billion in our markets through capital expenditures or about 48% of cash generated and returned cash to shareholders either in special dividends or by share repurchase in the amount of $9.3 billion or about 46% of cash generated. The company had approximately $2.6 billion remaining under its $3 billion share repurchase authorization at year-end. We generated $4.73 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2015, up 6.4% over 2014. We continue to have a balanced approach to capital allocation in 2015, deploying approximately $2.4 billion in capital spending and approximately $2.4 billion in share repurchases. In 2015, we've repurchased approximately 32 million shares of our stock. In addition to our financial performance, I was pleased with our progress with respect to our clinical agenda. In 2015, 106 or 78% of our eligible hospitals were recognized as Top Performers by the Joint Commission compared to approximately 31% of hospitals nationwide. The Joint Commission's Top Performer status is the highest recognition for achieving excellence in evidence-based care processes for certain medical conditions. In 2016, we will continue to leverage clinical technology, especially in concepts of big data, data analytics, and clinical informatics to deliver safe, high quality, and compassionate care for our patients. We will also continue our focus on programmatic development of service lines directed at expanding our clinical depth and capabilities. We will remain committed to continuous improvement in the quality of care and service as we strategically position the company to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. I'll close my comments with my thoughts on our 2016 guidance that is included in our release this morning. With respect to adjusted EBITDA growth, our guidance yields a 3% growth rate at the low point of the range and just under 7% at the high end. Our guidance reflects continued solid volume growth, reasonable pricing, and well managed expense growth, with little less contribution from Reform than the past two years. We transition into 2016 with momentum and we believe the company is well positioned to achieve its goals for 2016. Now, let me turn the call over to Bill to provide additional detail on the quarter, health reform, and 2016 guidance
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Great. Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information relating to the fourth quarter results and review our 2016 guidance. Then, I'll turn the call over to Sam for an update on operations. As Milton commented, we were extremely pleased with the quarter's results and the quarter finished a very strong 2015 for the company. Fourth quarter was coupled with a good payer mix and service mix and solid expense management, which combined to drive the quarter and the year's strong performance. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 8.9% to $2.131 billion from $1.956 billion last year. We reported an improvement of 50 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter to 20.8%. As a reminder, in last year's fourth quarter, we recorded a $68 million increase to Medicaid revenues related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program, reversing the reduction we had made in the third quarter of last year. Adjusting for the impact of this item as well as a decline of $27 million in EHR income and an increase of $24 million in share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA grew 15.4% over the fourth quarter of last year. Now, let me speak to volumes. In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 1.6% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 2.9%. Sam will provide more commentary on our volume trends in a moment. During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.6% and 1.8% respectively. This included both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 6.3% on a same facility basis and represent 32.8% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3% and 4.8% respectively in the quarter, consistent with trends we experienced in the third quarter. Same facility self-pay and charity admission increased 8.6% in the quarter, representing 7.7% of our total admissions compared to 7.2% last year. Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 0.6% and equivalent admissions increased 1.9% on a same facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. And same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represented 19.6% of our total ER visits in the quarter, which is consistent with last year. Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter, with our same facility case mix increasing 2.1% compared to the prior year period. Same facility surgical volumes increased 1.9% in the quarter, with same facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.5% and outpatient surgeries increasing 2.2% from the prior year. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.6% in the quarter. Same facility managed care and other, including exchange revenue per equivalent admission, increased 5.6% in the quarter, generally consistent with our third quarter results. Same facility managed care and other, including exchange case mix, increased 2.4% compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $494 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $958 million in the quarter or an increase of $46 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.873 billion, an increase of $448 million over the prior year period. Now, turning to expenses, expense management in the quarter was good as we were able to leverage strong volumes and a higher intensity of service. We also saw improvement from our Q3 expense levels as a result of various management actions we began last quarter. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.2% compared to the last year's fourth quarter, and sequentially, operating expense per equivalent admissions declined 0.3% from the third quarter of 2015. Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenue, increased 50 basis points to 44.9% compared to 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Sequentially, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved 200 basis points from the 46.9% we reported in Q3 of 2015. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission declined 2.1% for the fourth quarter, compared to the prior-year period, and improved 80 basis points, as a percentage of revenue, from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives. Our pharmacy cost trends moderated slightly in the quarter. Our total pharmacy cost was up approximately 9% in Q4 compared to the 13% increase we reported in Q3 of 2015. Other operating expenses improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to 18.0% of revenues. We recognized $1 million in electronic health record income in the quarter, compared to $28 million last year, and this was consistent with our expectations. As previously mentioned, our adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points over the prior-year period. But adjusting for the $68 million Texas waiver item in 2014 and the changes in EHR income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points for the quarter over the prior-year period. Let me briefly touch on health reform activity in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we saw 11,238 same facility exchange admissions, as compared to the 7,700 we saw in the fourth quarter of last year, and comparable to the 11,445 exchange admissions we reported in the third quarter of 2015. We saw just under 38,000 same facility exchange ER visits in the fourth quarter, compared to 25,600 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the 40,200 we reported in the third quarter of 2015. When we roll all the components of health reform that we can track, we currently estimate health reform contributed just under 6% of adjusted EBITDA for the full-year of 2015, and that was in line with our expectations. So all in all, a strong quarter that finished a very strong year for the company. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. Our cash flow remains very strong. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations was $1.558 billion compared to the $1.627 billion last year, which is primarily a result of changes in working capital offsetting the increase in net income. For the full-year of 2015, cash flow from operations was $4.734 billion, up from $4.448 billion last year, and free cash flow for 2015 was just over $1.864 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.179 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. So now let me move into a discussion about our 2016 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimate our 2016 consolidated revenues should range from $41.5 billion to $42.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $8.15 billion and $8.45 billion. Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admission growth to range between 2.5% and 4% for the year, and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range between 2% to 3% for 2016. We anticipate our Medicare revenues per equivalent admission to reflect a composite growth rate of approximately 1% to 2%, factoring in market basket changes and ACA reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases. Medicaid revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to be mostly flat year-over-year, excluding any changes in the Texas waiver revenues. And managed and commercial revenues per equivalent admission are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%. We expect a continued step-down of our EHR incentive income of about $40 million. EHR-related costs are no longer being considered incremental expenses, but do remain in the system to support EHR and other ongoing automation efforts. We also anticipated growth in share-based compensation of approximately $40 million. So we anticipate operating expense per adjusted admission growth of approximately 2.5%. Our guidance includes the estimated net impact of health reform. While we expect exchange volumes to continue to grow in the third year of health reform, isolating the net EBITDA impact of health reform from core operations is becoming more suggestive and increasingly difficult. We will continue to report on exchange volumes, which we can identify, the converting these variables to an EBITDA impact has increasing imprecision. We believe Reform will continue to contribute to the growth of the company and a reasonable estimate today is Reform will contribute approximately 1% of growth for the company in 2016. Relative to other aspects of our guidance, we anticipate capital spending to increase to $2.7 billion in 2016, which is in line with our three-year capital plan that we announced early in 2015. We estimate depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion and interest expense to be approximately $1.75 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%. And lastly, our average diluted shares are projected to be approximately 404 million shares for the year and earnings per diluted share guidance for 2016 is between $6 and $6.45. So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: Good morning. As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter was another solid quarter for volume growth across the company and capped off a very strong year of growth for HCA. Again, this quarter we had broad-based growth across our divisions, and we had broad-based growth across the various service lines that make up our business. To put a finer point on the consistency Milton highlighted, HCA has now grown its admissions and emergency room visits on a same facility basis in 18 out of the last 20 quarters. This consistency is not only seen in these growth metrics, but also, in any other areas of our business. For the fourth quarter, the company had very low flu volumes, which reduced our growth in admissions by approximately 0.7% and also reduced our growth in emergency room visits by almost 2%. 10 of 14 divisions had growth in admissions and emergency room visits in the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in both of these categories. 13 of 14 divisions had growth in adjusted admissions for the quarter. For the year, all divisions had growth in adjusted admissions. And within the division, 86% of all HCA domestic hospitals had growth in adjusted admissions. This broad-based performance reflects HCA's strong and diversified portfolio of networks and 42 domestic markets, most of which, we believe, still have good growth prospects. In addition to the strong portfolio performance, the company's growth across its diversified facilities and service lines was equally strong. On a same-facility basis, in-patient surgeries grew by 1.5% in the quarter and 2.1% for the year. Surgical admits grew by 80 basis points to 28.4% of total admits in the quarter, and for the year, surgical admits were slightly up over the prior year at 27.5%. Outpatient surgeries grew by 2.2% in the quarter and 1.6% for the year. Both components of this service line, hospital based and our freestanding ambulatory surgery center division showed solid growth. Behavioral health admissions grew by 7.9% in the quarter and 8.4% for the year. Rehab admissions grew by 6.4% in the quarter and 8.5% for the year. Deliveries were the only volumetric down for the quarter, it was down 1.8%. However, managed care deliveries were actually up. For the year, deliveries were up 0.8%. Average length of stay increased 1.1% in the quarter and 1.3% for the year. These increases are mostly a result of the company's growth agenda, which includes developing a more comprehensive and complex level of services across our provider networks. For example, trauma volumes across our growing network of trauma centers were up 27% for the year and cardiovascular surgery volumes were up over 6% for the year, which is a result of adding deeper, more complex capabilities to our existing programs. And finally, the company has been investing aggressively to expand its urgent care centers. These centers improve convenience for our patients and increase access to our networks. This past year, we had over 1 million urgent care visits, a 500% increase. Our urgent care centers coupled with 3.3% growth in the number of physicians, who have joined our medical staff, are making it easier for our patients to use an HCA network and improving our overall outreach efforts. As we move into 2016, we think HCA is well-positioned to succeed. We believe macros for our markets are still positive and we believe the company is heading into the year with momentum. Demand growth in our markets is strong. We estimated that approximately 2% per year driven primarily by population growth and positive economic trends. The pricing environment is stable, and we have good visibility into our contracts. The company is contracted for 85% of its commercial revenues in 2016, over 50% for 2017 and around 20% for 2018 at pricing terms that are consistent with the past few years. Market share is at an all-time high and opportunities still exist to increase it as we execute our growth agenda and increase our capital spending. Over the next two years, we will add close to 1,000 in-patient beds and 400 ER beds to address capacity constraints and growth opportunities. The competitive landscape in HCA's markets is mostly unchanged. Complementary end-market acquisitions are available, especially, in the outpatient areas. We have next-generation growth opportunities for many facilities within our portfolio. This past year, 80% of our hospitals had earnings growth. And lastly, we have a solid handle on cost trends, which we believe should be manageable in 2016. In summary, we believe the company has the right strategy and a right approach to the market for sustaining growth. We believe the company is resourcing its growth agenda appropriately, and we are improving our ability to execute even better by investing in systems and specialization across the company. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you, guys. And, Audrey, if you come back on and pole for questions. And we would like to keep questions to one at a time, so everyone gets a chance.
Operator: Thank you. And we will go first to A.J. Rice with UBS.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Hi, everybody. So I'm just thinking about the EBITDA growth target for 2016. You've got a 3% to 7% at the high- and low-end of the range or low- and high-end of the range. And I think Bill made the comment that 1% of that is probably attributable to incremental Reform benefit. And you also mentioned high-tech and stock-based comp. I guess, they're about a $40 million each headwind. So they're about 1%. They sort of eat up that Reform benefit. So the 3% to 7%, is it right to think about that going forward as sort of the parameters around your organic growth? Can you give us some flavor for how you think about that?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: A.J., thank you very much. Milt, do you want to take that?
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely. So, A.J., as you know, back in 2011 shortly after the IPO, we started giving long-term growth expectations for HCA again based on the conditions of the market, economic conditions, and the like. And we pegged that at about 3% to 5%. And so as we look now at the markets, the improvement in economic conditions and the like, we feel a little bit better about our growth prospects. Obviously, we've had a good run here, especially, over the past two years really over the last five years, but especially, over the past two years. And I feel like now we're more maybe in the 4% to 6% outlook. But, again, I caution to give long-term outlook and our industry right now with, again, some of the changes in developments, but we see it a little bit more favorably than we did, say, four years ago. And so, obviously, this year we feel good about our guidance in that 3% to 7% range. But on a long-term basis, I'd probably peg it now at 4% to 6%.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thanks, A.J.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks.
Operator: We'll move next to Andrew Schenker at Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to discuss a little bit more about the utilization trends. I mean, you obviously gave quite a bit of color about the economy, et cetera, but, I mean, even as 2015 progressed on kind of a two-year stack, you continue to see acceleration throughout the year, and your guidance remains quite strong for next year, especially, given the continued tough flu comp in 1Q. Maybe just really, talk about what you are doing to drive this increased and strong volume trends and really how we should think about the long-term sustainability of these positive volumes.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Andy, thank you. Sam's going to address that.
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: I think when you think about HCA's growth strategy, and we've spoken to this numerous times, we think, first and foremost, we have incredible markets where we do business. And those markets are yielding, on a composite basis, across the company approximately 2% increase in demand growth just coming from population growth, as well as aging baby boomers, increasing employment and so forth. On top of that, the company has achieved anywhere between 25 basis points to 40 basis points of market share gains over the past few years. And as we look forward, we see those basic components being similar to what I just laid out. And so next year's guidance includes about 2% to 2.5% demand growth at this particular point with our estimate, and then roughly 25 basis points to 30 basis points of market share gains. Our approach to gaining market share is clearly built around being the provider system of choice for our patients and for our physicians. And that involves four, five major dimensions that we invest in very, very aggressively. We monitor very, very closely. And those are centered around, do we have the right network of outpatient facilities and ease of access, if you will, in the HCA's facilities, building out comprehensive service lines, I mentioned that in my comments, and then, working with our physicians very, very effectively to enable them to do what they need to do for our patients. And we do that with one other dimension that we're investing in even more, and that's coordinating care across the HCA continuum and the HCA network. And that's yielding gains for us. Obviously, our capital spending is enhancing our growth, we believe, and putting us in a very strong competitive position within the markets. And then, finally, I think the competitive advantage that HCA has globally across these markets is that we have an incredible amount of best practice and solutions that we can export from one market to another and put that to use in a very timely go-to-market-quickly kind of way. And that gives us advantage, we believe, on all these dimensions, and globally, allows us to grow our business.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sam, thank you. Thank you, Andy.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Sheryl Skolnick at Mizuho Securities USA.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Good morning, and thank you. Listen, this is a very different tone, and congratulations on achieving a record year, or record quarter. Hard work, well-rewarded. I'm going to go back, though, and ask about the cost trends here, because this is such a substantial change from our last call. Can you talk about some of the things, I guess, that would be most probably a question for Sam that you've done to address the labor issues? Obviously, you're constantly monitoring them, but what's changed? What's improved? And should we now no longer be worried about nurse wage inflation and your ability to manage that cost going forward? Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Sheryl, thanks. And, Sam, gets that one again.
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: Okay. If you look at the fourth quarter and you make one adjustment that Bill mentioned in his comments about the $68 million of waiver revenue that was sort of misplaced from the third quarter to fourth quarter – that's probably not the right term, forgive me, Bill – but that reduced our SWB to basically flat with the fourth quarter of last year. So I was very pleased with that. What we saw year-over-year, and I'll speak to sequential in a moment, because I think the sequential performance is most important here, but year-over-year, we had about 1% improvement in productivity. We had a slowdown in the rate of growth in contract labor. It did grow, but it's slower than what it had grown in the previous nine months of the year. And so those are some year-over-year kind of metrics. But what was really impressive and what I was really pleased with our teams, and as I mentioned in the third quarter, we started to see this in September, but sequentially, we improved our productivity from third quarter to fourth quarter by 1.7%. Now in the previous two years, we had improved our productivity from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in low tenths, like 0.1% in one year, 0.3% in the other. So very significant movement by our teams to make some adjustments in our productivity. Contract labor did slow down, actually reduced by (32:28) 1% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. So that was encouraging. And as we mentioned in the third quarter call, we did see some stabilization, but we actually saw a bit of improvement sequentially in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. I mean, contract labor still remains an opportunity for the company. Nursing contract labor is somewhere between 8.5% and 9%. That's stabilized a little bit, but, nonetheless, an opportunity. As we look at what the company has been able to accomplish, I went back and studied, 80% of the last 20 weeks we've actually had a net gain in full-time RN positions across the company. And we've also dropped about 900 FTEs from orientation into supporting our patients. So I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in our hiring efforts. Our One HR (33:22) program is starting to get its sea legs, if you will, and really yield some benefit for the company. And as we finish our rollout in 2016, I'm eagerly awaiting improvements there. So as we think about wage rates for 2016, we are anticipating a little bit of acceleration, but something that's very, very manageable, we believe, within our overall budget. And so that's sort of the story on our labor for the fourth quarter.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right, Bill...
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Quick follow-on. I mean, in last quarter and the third quarter, we called out nursing turnover rates, again, the cause and effect of the contract labor increases. And we haven't solved the turnover issue in a quarter. We said that last quarter. And I really see that as an opportunity for the company in 2016 to improve that. And we have several initiatives that we will kick off to try to improve turnover in nursing, and in response, we should see a corresponding improvement in contract labor costs going forward as well. So, again, just to make it clear, we haven't solved the turnover issue. We're working on it. I expect to see improvement throughout 2016, and again, view it as an opportunity for the company.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right, thank you. Thank you, Sheryl.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Great. Thanks.
Operator: We'll move next to Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.
Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. I guess, last quarter you mentioned, I guess – a little bit about payer mix and what you saw in Q4 versus what you saw in Q3. I guess, last quarter specifically you mentioned Medicaid authorization slowing down in Texas and Kansas. Did that come through and help the quarter, or is that still a drag? And what's your assumption about payer mix going into 2016?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Yes. All right, Kevin. Thank you. Bill's going to take that.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Kevin. This is Bill. I'll start and give you some color on our uninsured, and maybe Sam wants to add into this. So you're right. Our uninsured admissions we called out in the third quarter. If you recall, we saw over a 13% growth in uninsured admissions in the third quarter. That dropped in the fourth quarter to just under 9%, 8.9% in the fourth quarter. As we mentioned in our calls in the past, there have been some noise when we do year-over-year comparisons, mainly because of the first year of health reform and Medicaid conversions. We did, as you mentioned, identify some processing issues in the third quarter of Medicaid applications in Texas and Kansas. We did see some improvements there, didn't necessarily have a material effect on us in the quarter. Just as a reference to that, uninsured admission growth of 8.9% represents roughly 2,800 admissions. And in the third quarter, it was roughly 4,400 admissions. So sequentially, we saw some improvement in there. Going forward, I would anticipate that our uninsured volume growth will track our uninsured ED volume growth. And right now, I believe kind of as in any change catalyst such as a new state expanding or some other macro trends, I'd anticipate our uninsured volume trends to settle out in the high single-digits. And that's what we have baked into our guidance going forward. Sam, any other mix comments?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: That's good. Kevin, thank you. Thanks, Bill.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut at Jefferies.
Jason Plagman - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. This is Jason Plagman on for Brian. Just a question, in your guidance, have you made any assumptions for benefit from the Louisiana Medicaid expansion?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Yeah. It's so immaterial in the overall scheme of things. We have – I'm counting up the facilities right now, we have four facilities in Louisiana, and they are not really material with respect to the company's overall position. So it doesn't have any significant impact at all on HCA. Obviously, it will benefit our Louisiana hospital, but it's not going to be material.
Jason Plagman - Jefferies LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Scott Fidel at Credit Suisse.
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. I had a question just about the rising case mix, and maybe if you can give some more details on what you think the drivers of that are. And just interested if you're seeing that case mix being moved higher by the exchange volumes or if there's other factors that are driving that?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Sam, you want to take that?
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. The short answer on the exchange volume is no. It's not big enough in the overall scheme of our volume to drive the company's composite case mix. With respect to case mix, again, I'll refer you back to my comments. I mean, the company is very intentional about trying to drive more complex, high acuity-type services to our facilities. Our strategy, our core strategy within our individual markets is to be able to offer somewhere in the HCA system all services to a patient. So, for example, if we need a transplant, we want to have capabilities at one particular facility where we can offer those kinds of things. So over the last four years, five years, we've added a significant number of services to our facilities and to our markets that have increased our case mix and increased the overall acuity and built out the capabilities of our provider systems. This past year, we opened up three new burn centers, as an example. We've opened up probably 10 to 12 new trauma centers. We've expanded our cardiovascular services where we have now 14 to 16 programs TAVR programs, which is very sophisticated procedure for valve surgery. So those kind of developments are ongoing within the company as part of our core strategy to be able to provide all services, a comprehensive array of services, to our system and to any patient that hits the HCA network.
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. And just a little bit more on that. I mean, what Sam described, these services be it burns or trauma, typically, lead to more surgical procedures in the facility. And as I mentioned in my comments, we've reported seven consecutive quarters of surgical growth. And so as we grow our surgeries, obviously, we're growing our case mix. And that's showing up in our numbers.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you. Thank you, Scott.
Operator: We'll go next to Whit Mayo at Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks. Just curious, are you guys expecting any changes with Texas UPL, Florida LIVE (39:59), just any supplemental payment changes for 2016 that we need to be aware of?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right, Whit. Bill will take that.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Hey, Whit. This is Bill. Right now, no, our Texas waiver program and our guidance anticipates, and we're optimistic that the State and CMS will yield some continuation of the program in the fourth quarter. And so we're not anticipating now material changes to that going forward, nor are we in Florida LIVE (40:27) program right now as well. So our 2016 guidance for at least the revenue side is fairly consistent with what our 2015 results are.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thanks, Whit.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yep.
Operator: We'll go next to Sarah James at Wedbush Securities.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Guidance looks like it implies about 4.6% to 7% growth in revenue versus the 3% to 7% EBITDA that you talked about. Or if I look at the range of revenue in adjusted EBITDA guidance, it looks like at the low-end, it was accounting for up to 30 basis points of the decline. So is that just conservatism? And if not, could you walk us through some of the moving pieces that you see going on there?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: For Bill, either...
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I mean, I'll try to cover it, and you can add in. I think I get the gist. You're looking at the low-end of our guidance. As Milton said in our comments earlier, the midpoint of our guidance represent on as reported about a 5% growth over our 2015 levels. When you adjust for the high-tech and share-based comp, the midpoint is roughly 6%, which is one of the higher levels that we've guided going forward. Yeah, on the low-end that would change it from 3% to 4%, but it gets us in that range of kind of 4% to 6% when you factor those items. Again, Milton mentioned in his comments in response to an earlier question. So I think it from a guidance perspective compared to historically where we've guided, we feel very comfortable with where we stand right now.
Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Got it. So on the core business with everything that you're doing with expense control for contract labor and drug costs, you see at least a maintenance of margins if not an improvement?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. I think that's correct. That's what we're looking for. And as we said, when we get on the high-end of that range, we expect some margin expansion, and in the middle point, it's in margin maintenance mode.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thank you, Sarah. Thanks, Bill.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe at Citi.
Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Just want to go back to the cost lines. Again, SWB certainly improved, but looks like a really strong performance on supplies with it down on an adjusted admission basis. You talked about sort of higher acuity and good surgery numbers, so can you maybe talk about the improvements there, and I guess, the sustainability of that into 2016? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. I think it's important to understand that last year in the fourth quarter our supply costs were uniquely high and actually increased quite a bit more than we had anticipated. I don't remember all the specific reasons when I was looking at the metrics, though, we did jump up sequentially from the third to fourth quarter quite significantly. And in 2013, we also jumped up, but not nearly as much. This year, we jumped up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter on a per unit basis, but not nearly as much as the fourth quarter last year. So the comp was, I'll say, favorable, if you will, to some degree. We obviously have a very robust supply chain program. We did see some moderation as Bill mentioned in pharmaceutical costs. And I think that the net of all that yielded pretty much a supply cost metric about where we thought it was going to be inside of our own plan. So there's nothing really other than a difficult comp that I think speaks to supply expense.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Milt?
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I just want to maybe talk about supplies a bit more longer term and some possible upside we have. HPG, our GPO, HealthTrust Purchasing Group, continues to grow. Tenet Healthcare will join HPG in February here in just a few days. And that should give us some opportunities with respect to further pricing improvement just off our base pricing through HPG contract. So, on a long-term basis, I think, again, we also have upside just from how we're negotiating our contracts and pricing through the GPO, which, I think, will drive benefits not only for HCA, but really all of our members within HPG over the longer-term over next, say, 12 to 18 months.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thank you, Ralph
Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Gary Lieberman at Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about your growth in urgent care and how it fits in with the inpatient strategy and if you're starting to see any oversaturation in any markets from urgent care?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: We have 66 urgent care centers inside of HCA, most of which have come in the form of acquisitions, the acquisition we did in Dallas and the recent acquisition that we did in Las Vegas. We have developed urgent care centers in Kansas City and Nashville and we have plans to expand our urgent care center platform to other markets and even within existing markets expanded. There are a lot of urgent care centers inside of HCA markets, but with the acquisition of CareNow in particular, we think we acquired a best-in-class provider and our plan is to replicate that capability in other markets and roll out the model that they've used that is very, very effective for our patients and very, very effective for our network. As it relates to our network, we do generate downstream referrals from our urgent care centers to both our physicians who are connected to HCA system as well as our emergency room and then on into the inpatient activity. The volume of downstream referrals is not nearly as large as our freestanding emergency room, which produce a larger downstream flow to our hospitals. But the components that we're trying to build here between physician clinics, urgent care centers, freestanding emergency room and then hospital-based emergency room is all part of having a system-wide approach to creating convenience, ease of access, user-friendly solutions for our patients, and then building out the geographical footprint of the HCA network.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Gary, thank you.
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Rigg at Susquehanna Financial Group.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the trends in the bad debt expense. It's been volatile this year and the seasonal trend from Q3 to Q4, for the first time, that trend has gone – the bad debt's gone down sequentially since 2011. So I was hoping you could give us some color on what you're seeing there. And then more importantly, when we think about 2016, is sort of this $1.1 million-ish range per quarter the right level to think about? Thanks a lot.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Bill?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I'll take that. Thanks. As we have reminded people in the past, when you look at bad debts, we think you should look in terms of our total uncompensated care, which includes bad debt, charity and uninsured discounts, because, in any given quarter, you can have some fluctuations in there. And that's why we give the charity and uninsured discount numbers in my commentary. When you look at uncompensated care, anticipate that to grow as a percent of our gross revenue consistent with what our uninsured growth is. In the fourth quarter, when I look at uncompensated care, we saw sequential improvement versus the third quarter, and when I look at year-over-year, that year-over-year growth in uncompensated care is tracking our high-single digit uninsured volume growth there. So, you are subject to some fluctuations in the bad debt line alone as we adjust our uninsured discount percentage, and so you look at uncompensated care in total. But as we look at bad debts, I would think we'd continue to see that in play at our high-single digit uninsured volume growth.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Chris, thanks.
Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to John Ransom at Raymond James.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I think your story is pretty straight forward. My question is, is there anything that would tempt you off your current path? You haven't really made a big acquisition in a while. Is there anything other than a big market coming up for sale that you're now thinking about? And then secondly, are there any plans, in my lifetime, to provide any more color on Parallon as a separate entity? Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Hey, John, how long you're going to live here?
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Let me take this.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: I'll let Milt take this.
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: The Parallon first, we don't see Parallon as a separate entity. And actually when we formed Parallon, we really wanted it to be a subsidiary within HCA that we could grow. And we still have that objective and Parallon is growing. I mentioned HPG earlier, solid growth in HPG and I think we'll continue to see that as well. With respect to your first question around acquisition opportunities, we have the financial flexibility, as you know, and access to capital to do more significant acquisitions. We're very disciplined in the sort of markets and facilities that we want to invest in. If it's just a matter of course of owning more hospitals, we could do that. But, again, they wouldn't fit our profile, wouldn't fit the long-term growth prospects and return prospects that we're looking for. So, we have been very disciplined in that and we will continue to be disciplined. That being said, we pretty much at any point in time, we have a pipeline of meaningful opportunities. As I said...
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Well, you never buy anything though, so.
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, I was going to say you heard me say many times over recent...
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Your M&A guys have to be getting bored. They keep bringing the deals and you guys never buy anything.
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Of course, we do a lot of in-market acquisitions. But as far as the big ones you're speaking to, things like say Kansas City that happened in 2003, those opportunities are really hard to find. They're going to come out of the not-for-profit sector. And typically, we may engage in conversation, but many times, these organizations decide ultimately not to sell. So, we'll continue to be active and looking for the right opportunities. But, again, we're not building any of those into our expectations here in the short-term. But then again, if we find the right one, we're prepared to move on it. We've got the balance sheet and capability to do it. And we'll continue to be active in pursuing them, again, if the right markets present themselves.
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: Let me add one thing to Milton's comment about in-market acquisitions. Just over this past year, we acquired a physician network in San Jose, which significantly solidified our position strategy in a very important and growing market to HCA. We bought a large urgent care center inside of Las Vegas, which significantly improved our access and physician relationships and so forth in that market, which is a very important market to HCA. We bought a rural hospital that was contiguous to Orlando and Jacksonville. We were able to re-channel referrals out of that hospital into HCA's system, pick up incremental market share. So, these complementary acquisitions, on top of that, I think we acquired five ambulatory surgery centers this past year and added it to our network within a couple of major markets. So these things are very, very strategic and create more durability, more competitiveness, and allow us to grow organically in very high growth markets. So, those are conservative from a capital allocation standpoint, predictable from a returns standpoint, and provide a lot of synergies to the organization. And so from that standpoint, those are very, very important. We don't call them out that often, but they're very, very important to those individual markets.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: John, thank you very much.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Matthew Borsch at Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just wondering if you can talk about, within bad debt, the portion that relates to insured patient cost sharing and maybe how you saw that trend this year and as a percentage of the bad debt mix, and where you think that's going.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Matt, thank you. Bill, you want to get that?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Matt, thank you. Historically and pretty much consistent this year, about 30% of our bad debt is associated with kind of the deductible and copay and 70% coming from the uninsured population. When I look at kind of our deductible and copay and patient liability, really, what we've seen throughout 2015, we're seeing those kind of average balances grow in that 10% to 11% level, where maybe historically they were growing in that 7% to 8%. So, the average balances are growing a little bit. Our collections are holding – so our collections per account are holding with what are historical levels. So, it is slightly contributing to some increase in bad debt, but the majority of the bad debt's being driven by uninsured activity that we have.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thanks, Bill.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: We'll go next to Ana Gupte at Leerink Partners.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the question about the bad debt as it relates to the health insurance exchanges. The plans are – generally, the public plans are saying it's about 30% of their membership is special enrollments and, generally speaking, the special enrollment people are incurring, I think, 25% to 55% higher claims costs. And I was wondering, as you saw in the third quarter, the uptick in the bad debt, you talked about the Medicaid delays in processing, but a piece of it, I think, was exchange related. And in the fourth quarter, as these guys probably saw the deductibles run through, do you have any idea of what their utilization patterns have been? And if they end up being delinquent between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, if your claims adjudication has already been able to identify that, are you talking to – or are your claims systems on reimbursement communicating with the plans to make sure that's not happening?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Ana, thanks. Bill?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, first, put in perspective that our exchange volume is roughly 2% of the total company volume. So the exchange activity by itself is relatively small going forward on that. So, as we look at kind of the activity within the exchanges, we did mention in the third quarter we were seeing some previous exchange volume move to uninsured. It was 400 admissions for HCA in the third quarter. It was roughly the same in the fourth. That's on 460,000 admissions for the company. So, yeah, there is some activity in that area. But for HCA, it's immaterial for us. And it's contained within the overall aspect of our bad debt trends that I've talked about previously.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Bill, thanks. We've got time just for a couple more quick ones here.
Operator: And we'll go next to Josh Raskin at Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the CapEx numbers. I know you guys outlined the increase earlier this year and talking about $2.7 billion. So, just curious how much of that is maintenance CapEx? And then maybe you can give us a little bit of color on how much is being spent on traditional acute care hospitals versus outpatient centers and other things, or maybe just more color on those expenditures.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thanks, Josh. Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: We spend about $250 million a year in IT-related expenditures. So I'm going to just lay that out there. Then, about $1 billion of our spend is what I would call routine kind of investments. So, then you've got roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion that's related to growth prospects, capacity constraints, new service line development, outpatient facilities and so forth. As I mentioned in my comments, the investments that we've been making are producing about 1,000 new beds over the course of 2016 and 2017. That's slightly up over the number of beds that we put into service in 2014 and 2015 and slightly up over 2012 and 2013. We have a number of markets that are approaching capacity and they're very significant markets to HCA. And a lot of this capital is going specifically to these markets that are at a certain level of capacity, inpatient capacity, outpatient capacity, primarily in our ERs, or surgical capacity. And so, it's very well diversified both in service line capability and also within our market. So, it's being shared very broadly across the company. Again, we think this diversified approach to different kind of service allocations and market allocation creates a very conservative return profile for HCA. The more we can put it on an existing chassis, where we have physicians, we have fixed costs, we have a reputation in the market, the easier it is to produce a return because we're able to leverage those existing capabilities. So that's our fundamental approach. We do have a few markets where we're adding new facilities like new hospitals. They're more low startup hospitals that are very important to geographical presence and also to network development. But those don't add a lot of volume, but they do create new relationships. And over the long pull, we think they'll be very significant facilities to our markets.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Bill, did you want to add...
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I'd just say with our increase in capital spend, and Sam and I, along with our group presidents are spending time out in the field within our hospitals. And from that we see opportunities, opportunities to invest, as Sam said, to expand services or to deal with capacity constraints that would otherwise exist. And it is a conservative investment strategy versus an acquisition for the reason Sam just noted. And just, I guess, to back up our performance, if you look back two years ago, our return on invested capital was 14.1%. And that's an incredibly – I think incredible number to start with. But based on the 12 months ended December 2015, our return on invested capital is 15.4%. So, if we're investing more capital in our existing market, we're seeing a return growth. And so, again, we like the strategy. That's why we expanded it towards the – over the three years to $7.7 billion, up about $0.5 billion. And again, it gives us confidence with our guidance to see these opportunities in the fast-growing markets.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thanks, Josh. Two more questions.
Operator: We'll go next to Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. The reality is you've answered most of my questions. So I won't...
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Next?
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I'll let you...
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sorry.
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Go ahead, we'll let you. Do you have one?
Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No, I was just going to say, go ahead and take the last one. You've answered really my substant question, so I don't want to hold you up.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Gary.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right.
Operator: And we'll take our last question from Paula Torch at Avondale Partners.
Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC: Well, thanks, guys, and, Gary, for squeezing me in. I'll just end with a quick question, I think, maybe on market share. So, I was wondering if you might just give us a little bit of an idea of how much more room is left to gain market share in your market or how much of an uptick you can get longer-term in market share? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sam, you want to close with that ne?
Samuel N. Hazen - Chief Operating Officer: Well, we're running 24.5% market share across all of HCA's market. So, I'd like to think we have 75 percentage points of upside. No, I'm being facetious there, Paula. We've been on a pattern of growing like I said between 25 basis points and 40 basis points a year. My thinking is for 2016 in particular and I think that's a reasonable target for us. The thing about HCA is we compete in a very fragmented sort of environment, where the same competitor doesn't really exist from one market to the other. So, what we compete against in Miami is not necessarily the same system that we compete against in Dallas, nor is that the same system that we compete against in Salt Lake City or even San Jose. So that fragmentation allows us to, I think, have advantage in the market. And when we can deploy capital in a very unique way or effective way or create a service line capability or move some other initiative across HCA's markets, we're able to do that maybe without our competitors being able to see it like we are able to see it because of our multi-market perspective. So from a market share standpoint, I think that's a pretty good metric for the company as far as the type of growth that we're thinking about, and I don't see any reason why that's not doable for the company in the near term.
Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Paula, thank you. We thank all of you and look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor Campbell: All right. Cassandra, thank you very much and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I would like to welcome everyone on today's call including those of you listening to our webcast. With me here this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO and Executive Vice President. Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., including losses and gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in our third quarter earnings release which I hope all of you have seen this morning. The call is being recorded, a replay will be available later today. So with that, I will turn the call over to Milton.
Milton Johnson: All right. Thank you, Vic and good morning to everyone joining us on the call and the webcast today. I hope everyone has had a chance to review the press release we issued this morning. Following my remarks, I will turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more details on the results of the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter totaled $1.815 billion compared to $1.828 billion in last year's third quarter. Adjusting both periods for EHR incentive income, share-based compensation and RAC Medicaid waiver adjustments, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 3.5% over the prior year. The results of the third quarter fell short of our internal expectations primarily due to higher than expected labor cost and to a lesser extent and unfavorable payer mix shift and increased drug cost. As we analyze the quarter, we were extremely pleased with our revenue growth in the quarter. Reported revenue grew 6.9% over the last year's third quarter. Revenue growth was primarily driven by our volume growth as we reported strong same facility growth in admissions, adjusted admissions, emergency room visits and surgery cases in the face of tough comps for last year. Volume growth was broad-based across our markets and service lines. Our volume growth agenda is comprehensive and consistently delivers solid results. This speaks to the positive characteristics of our urban markets and the execution of our strategies to invest capital on additional inpatient and outpatient capacities and to the development of clinical capability across our service lines. Based on expected growth in demand in our markets and continued expansion of our market share, I believe we will continue to see opportunities for volume growth. On the cost side, we reported higher labor expense than we have seen in recent trends. Labor productivity and contract labor presents opportunities for improvement and certain management actions have been implemented while others will continue to be implemented to address productivity and contract labor expense. Bill and Sam can provide additional details on our labor cost and our actions to address in the Q&A. Now moving to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter totaled $1.101 billion and our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 3.84 times. This morning we announced that the board has authorized an additional share repurchase program for up to 3 billion of the company's outstanding shares which would be in addition to the 1 billion authorization that we announced in May which currently has approximately 235 million remaining. The company has indicated in the past that its first priority for use of cash would be to pursue organic growth and reinvest in existing markets. Second, we look for M&A opportunities and then third, we consider based on market conditions, either debt repayment or share repurchases. Today's announced share repurchase authorization is consistent with its capital deployment strategy. During the quarter the company repurchased 5.1 million shares of its stock at a cost of $446 million. Year-to-date, through October 23, 2015, we have repurchased 22.6 million shares at a cost of $1.765 billion. In fact, since October 28, 2014, the company has repurchased approximately 36.7 million of its shares at a total cost of $2.765 billion. And then finally I would like to congratulate Dr. Jonathan Perlin on his election to membership into the National Academy of Medicine. His election is recognition of his many contributions to healthcare and his commitment to improving patient care. Now I will turn the call over to Bill.
William Rutherford: Thank you, Milton and good morning everybody. I would like to move right in to some of the areas affecting the company's performance for the quarter then I will run through some of our operating statistics and finish with an update on health reform. When adjusted for the RAC settlement and Texas waiver accrual adjustment we recorded in the third quarter of last year, as well as share-based compensation and high-tech, on a year-over-year basis the company recorded a 7.2% revenue growth and a 3.5% adjusted EBITDA growth in Q3 of 2015 when compared to Q3 of 2014. Also when adjusted for these items our adjusted EBITDA margin declined [7] [ph] basis points for the quarter as compared to last year. There are three primary areas I would like to discuss that affected the company's performance. First, we carried more labor cost in the quarter compared to our plan. There are primarily two items that impacted our labor cost. We saw an increase in the use of contract labor during the quarter. Our contract labor expense was up $55 million or 36% as compared to the third quarter of 2014. We have seen growth throughout the year but it did accelerate during this quarter. This increased use of contract labor is used to fill in for staff vacancies that occur because of higher turnover rates and needs we have to serve the increased volume. Because of the premium we have to pay for these contract labor resources, we estimate this issue had about a $25 million impact on the company's year-over-year performance. The other labor observation I will call out is some productivity declines we experienced in the quarter. In essence we didn’t achieve the operating leverage we had anticipated from the volume growth. We did see this developing in the quarter and our management teams have already begun necessary adjustments. We estimate this issue had about $25 million impact on the company's performance for the quarter. The second area that impacted our results in the quarter is the continued increases in pharmaceutical costs. Our pharmacy cost in the third quarter of 2015 were up in total just under 13%. When we adjust for borrowing growth, we estimate the company had about $15 million higher pharmacy cost due to price increases for certain classes drugs. We have seen multiple price increases for a small number of drugs which primarily relate to single manufactured pharmaceuticals. We have various strategies we are deploying to attempt to offset these cost. And the third area is we saw an increase in our uninsured borrowings in the quarter. Recall, we saw this developing in the second quarter. In Q3 of this year, our uninsured admissions were up 13.6% as compared to Q3 of 2014 and uninsured adjusted admissions were up 8.8% over the prior year. For perspective, this uninsured admission growth equates to roughly 4,400 admissions. These results were generally broad-based across our markets. Given our presence in Florida and Texas, the uninsured growth in these two states accounted for just under 75% of the uninsured growth for the company. We believe there are a couple of drivers of this uninsured growth. One is, we saw a slowing of Medicaid conversions in the quarter. That is uninsured patients that become qualified for Medicaid. We believe state processing issues in both Texas and Kansas impacted a number of Medicaid applications that were reviewed during this quarter. And we believe this accounts for approximately 25% of the uninsured increase. We also saw an increase in the number of people previously registered as insured that were converted to self-pay in the quarter. For instance, we saw 480 patients who were previously registered as health exchange convert over to self-pay in the quarter. We believe this is likely due to non-payment of premiums. Adjusted for these two items, we saw an underlying growth of uninsured patients who presented during the quarter of about 6.5%. And most of this growth we attributed to our 6.2% growth in uninsured emergency room business. The impact to the company of this uninsured volume increase is the incremental variable cost we have to serve these patients. We estimate we carried approximately $20 million of incremental cost to the serving of this uninsured volume growth as compared to the prior years. So we believe these three areas are the primary driver of the company's performance relative to our plan for the quarter. Our teams across the company are actively addressing these and other areas to counter some of these trends. As Milton indicated, we were pleased by our topline performance and I will next move into a summary of some of our volume statistics. As we reported, the third quarter -- in the third quarter our same facility admissions increased 2.9% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 3.6% against some fairly difficult comps from last year. Sam will provide more commentary on the drivers of this volume in a moment but I will give you some results by payer class. During the third quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.4% and 3.1% respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 8.9% on a same facility basis and represents 33% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3% and 4.9% respectively in the quarter. Managed care and other which includes exchange admissions increased 1.4% and equivalent admissions increased 1.8% on a same facility basis in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility emergency room business increased 5.8% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility case mix or intensity of service or acuity increased in the quarter 0.7% compared to the prior year period. Same facility surgeries increased 1.4% in the quarter. The same facility in-patient surgeries increasing 1.6% and outpatient surgeries increasing 1.2% from the prior year. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 1.9%. Adjusted for last year's RAC and waiver adjustments, same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.2%. Same facility managed care and other including exchanges, revenue per equivalent admission increased 5% in the quarter. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $525 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $914 million in the quarter, a decline of $117 million from the prior year period. Our same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.755 billion or an increase of $642 million over the prior year period. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter with cash flows from operations totaling $1.101 billion. Year-to-date cash flows from operations were $3.176 billion or a 12.6% increase from prior year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.586 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. And debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.84 times at September 30 of '15 compared to 3.96 times, December 31, 2014. And lastly, let me touch on health reforms. In the third quarter, we saw 11,445 same facility exchange admissions as compared to the 7,720 we saw in the third quarter of last year or a 48% year-over-year growth of exchange activity. Our Q3 volume is in line with our expectations and comparable to the 11,560 exchange admissions we served in the second quarter of 2015. We saw 40,200 same facility exchange ER visits in the third quarter compared to just over 27,000 in the third quarter of 2014 and 44,740 in the second quarter of 2015. Based on our look back of previous coverage, we still estimate about 40% of these admissions were uninsured prior to health reform. When we roll all the components of health reform that we could track, we currently estimate health reform contributed to just under 6% of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. So that concludes my remarks and I will turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel Hazen: Good morning. I am going to concentrate my comments on a little bit more detail around our volume for the quarter. As mentioned earlier, volume growth was solid in the third quarter. We believe this performance continues to reflect growing demand for healthcare services in HCA markets and further gains in market share for the company. We believe the gains in market share have been driven by combination of solid execution of our growth agenda and increased capital spending that has been invested to improve access to our networks and to add operational capacity. Our growth in volume was broad-based across most of the companies markets and it was also broad-based across the various service lines of our business. On a same facility, year-over-year basis for the quarter, all but one of our 14 domestic divisions had growth in admissions and growth in adjusted admission. All domestic divisions had growth in emergency room visits, seven divisions had growth in managed care and exchange admission and nine divisions had growth in adjusted admissions for these payer classes. Managed care and exchange ER business grew by 3.5%. 12 divisions had growth in emergency room visits for these payer classes. Nine divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Surgical admissions accounted for 27.3% of total admissions for the quarter, consistent with the third quarter of the previous year. This quarter is the tenth straight quarter with growth in inpatient surgeries. Ten divisions had growth in hospital-based outpatient surgeries which were up 0.8% for the company. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes have grown in nine out of the last ten quarters. Surgeries grew by 1.8% in our ambulatory surgery division. Surgical growth was strong in orthopedics, neurosciences and cardiovascular service lines. Other categories of our inpatient business were strong also. Deliveries for the quarter were up 0.9%, managed care and exchange deliveries were up 5.7%. Neonatal admissions grew 1%. Behavioral health admissions were up 7.4%. Rehab admissions were up 9% and our average length of stay grew by 1.6%, reflecting the higher case mix and acuity of our admissions. Market share trends for the company's inpatient business for the 12-month period ended March 2015, were slightly improved over past trends. Our market share grew by 31 basis points. As a result, the company's composite market share is at 24.6%. Approximately 79% of our market increased share and gains were achieved across most service line categories. Overall, inpatient demand across HCA markets continued to show sequential strength during this period. Demand growth accelerated in our markets in each of the last three quarters of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 with the first quarter showing growth of 3.9%. Commercial demand in HCA markets was stronger for this period with an increase of almost 5%. We believe inpatient demand in both the second and third quarters of 2015 were also strong. We will report on these quarters when the data is available. So with that, let me turn the call back to Vic for questions.
Victor Campbell: All right. Thank you very much. Cassandra, if you could come back on and let's take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Josh Raskin of Barclays.
Joshua Raskin: Appreciate all of the color on the uncompensated care. But I guess first question on, or my only question, will be on physician compensation. And I'm just curious, are you seeing any increases in cost to recruit or retain physicians? And maybe if you could speak specifically around the ED that will be helpful as well.
Victor Campbell: Sam will take that.
Samuel Hazen: Okay. Yes, let me answer this. And let me frame our physician discussion a bit. We have about 37,000 active participants on our medical staff, physicians. Of that, about 10% are employed by HCA. Our employment numbers on a year-over-year basis are up about 15%. About 40% of that is related to the acquisition of the urgent care company in Dallas, Fort Worth. So we are up roughly 7% to 8% on employees positions. That trend is generally consistent with the previous two years and so we continue to add to our medical staff both from the standpoint of employed positions as well as affiliated positions. Our medical staff in total has grown about 2.5% so far this year which is a really good number for the company. And so we are not seeing anything unusual with respect to physician compensation elements inside of our business. With respect to the emergency room specifically, we do have a number of companies that we work with across the country. We have various relationships with them. But for the most part, that component of our business is managing at a normal trend and we are not seeing any kind of unique changes to our relationships with those organizations. Nor are we seeing it in anesthesia or radiology or any of the other hospital based areas. So that issue is really not presenting a significant challenge to HCA.
Operator: And we will go next to Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: I just wanted to dig into the cost issues a little bit. As far as the labor costs go, it's a little bit unusual for me to think about needing temporary labor and losing productivity. So if you can just give a little bit of color about what exactly happened there. And then how much of this you think that you have addressed for Q4 and how much of this do you think you've addressed for 2016? I guess, specifically labor costs but if there are any savings on the pharmacy or anything you can do on mix, that will be helpful as well.
Victor Campbell: All right. Kevin, thank you. Sam?
Samuel Hazen: Okay. Let me try to give as much color as I can on our labor spend and I want to start with contract labor. And I think there are a couple of macro issues that we are sorting through that are really difficult to specifically ascribe anything to but I think they are reasonable assumptions. I mean we do have an improving economy as we have indicated across most of HCA's markets and we think that is having some effect on our overall labor equation. It's pocketed in some markets and more significant in others, but nonetheless it is having some effects we believe and we have been indicating that as a potential issue. Is it material at this particular point in time, I don’t think it is. I think it's a manageable event. The other issue is, within certain service lines we have seen significant competition in new supply. And that’s especially relevant in the emergency room where we have seen difficulties in recruiting emergency room nurses and having to use contract labor to service our emergency rooms. But the specific issues for HCA related to contract labor are really three-fold. One, we have seen an increase in turnover, nursing turnover in the company. It was running last year about 17.5%. It's trended up to about 19%. So that’s created some challenge for us and we have had to use some contract labor to deal with that. The second thing is, we have sustained very strong volume across the company throughout the year and that’s requiring some additional staffing in order to service that volume. And then we have had a few recruitment challenges and some minor transition issues we think are temporary with respect to the rollout of our One HR model. And so that’s contributed to the growth in contract labor within our nursing ranks. Last year about 6.5% of our nursing spend was in contract labor. This year it's about 8.7%. So we have seen fairly sizable increase and that has been accelerating a little bit throughout the year as Bill indicated and some of this started last year. So what we are trying to do on the contract labor side specifically, is really focus on improving our turnover metrics. And we think we have a reasonable plan for being able to do that and some early indications of some positive indicator. The first thing is really related to better onboarding and support for new grads. We hire a lot of new graduate nurses and they have a tendency to turnover a higher pace if they are not supported properly. So we have got two or three different programs that we are utilizing to deal with the turnovers that we are seeing with the new graduate nurses. There is nurse residency programs that we are using and we are also leveraging our own internal registry company, Workforce Solutions, to sponsor certain programs and create a better environment for our new grads. The second thing that we are doing is streamlining our recruiting process a bit to get the right nurses on the floor at the right time. And I think we have made some adjustment as we have moved through our One HR rollout to improve that and that’s going to yield some benefit. And then finally, we have increased our training of our managers. We have got some better metrics and even greater accountability around turnover. And where we need to, we have adjusted wages and we will continue to do that in isolated cases. The good news here is this, and this is part of the productivity challenge that we experienced. We actually have 750 additional nurses in the HCA pipeline right now that are related to graduate nursing programs and they are going through orientation. That is a very significant increase over last year when we had about 2,400 at this time. So we are up to almost 3,100 from 2,400. And we think that’s going to create some opportunities to reduce or at least moderate the growth in contract labor. But those graduate nurses create a part of the productivity problem that we had in the quarter. Our productivity was probably off about 0.7% as you look at FTEs per adjusted occupied bed. That represented about 1,500 FTEs, if you will. So about half of those were attributable we believe to the onboarding and the orientation of graduate nurses. The other area that has contributed to some of our productivity challenge has been the acceleration of initiatives in the company to advance our growth position and our competitive positioning within the marketplace. We have numerous field base initiatives that are centered on positioning the company for growth and we think those make a sense over the long run, but unfortunately they have ramp up, startup cost and so forth that create a little bit of a productivity drag on our overall metric. We have a few other corporate initiatives that you have heard about. Whether they are in clinical IT or in One HR, that are creating a little bit of a challenge for us in the short run and we think those will phase out over time. And then finally some of our startup hospitals and new acquisitions have created a little bit of a dislocation with respect to HCA productivity versus the new hospital productivity. Having said all that, we have refocused and redoubled our efforts to make sure that our systems are working properly, that our scheduling mechanisms are precise and we saw some indications of improvement mid-quarter in September using that as a point of reference. We have significantly improved over August and July as it related to typical productivity measures reflecting some of these graduate nurses coming off orientation and at the same time making sure we didn’t have any mistakes, if you will, in our overall management. So we are confident that the company is doing the right thing with respect to the adjustments that we need to make. We are also doing the right thing with respect to hiring nurses and making sure that we can replace them, contract labor with permanent nurses. And we also believe we are doing the right thing by executing on these different initiatives that are preparing the company for success down the road as opposed to ignoring those or putting those particular initiatives off. So I think that’s a long-winded answer. I know that’s on a lots of peoples mind but I want everybody to understand how we are thinking about it and what we are doing to manage it as an organization.
Victor Campbell: Sam, thanks. Kevin, thank you. Just let me add that, as you can clearly hear from Sam's description, we clearly understand the issues in the quarter with respect to labor cost. I can tell you the organization is highly focused on making as many corrective actions as possible, as quickly as possible. Productivity, we can react to that more timely. Contract labor, more of a mid-term, intermediate term and we expect to make short term improvements. But to get back to where we were may take more of an intermediate term but we are definitely understanding issues and I think we are doing everything reasonably possible to address them.
Operator: And we will go next to Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Borsch: Yes. Maybe a high-level question if I could, and I'm not expecting that you have all the answers here. But if you look at the exchange attrition that you saw in the quarter. Number one, I'd sort of be interested in how you think that compares to a year ago? And number two, at a higher level, is there something that's brewing here that may be wrong with the perception of the value of health coverage albeit even very subsidized, that people who had coverage before aren't paying the premiums but are showing up in the emergency room for care that presumably most of that is going to be written off given limited ability to pay. Just curious, your thoughts on that as you look ahead to next year and what to expect from the exchange enrollment?
Victor Campbell: Thanks, Matt and I think Bill wants to...
Samuel Hazen: Yes. Let me address piece of it and Bill may add some more detail and color on this. But keep in mind that the benefit of health reform is still materially in line with our expectation for the year. And we still see the upside of reform and we saw growth in the exchanges in the third quarter of this year over the third quarter of last year. So we are still seeing solid growth. Now the issue of seeing some reduction in terms of lives in the exchanges, is realty as well. I don’t have data through the third quarter, I have CMS data through June where I can compare the number of lives in the exchange as of end of March as compared to end of June at 2015. And there is a decrease at the end of June. Nationally it's about 2.3% fewer lives in the exchange and for HCA states it's about 3%. So we are seeing -- and most of that is because of Florida. Florida has among the highest disenrollment numbers as far as percentage. Although still a very high number enrolled in exchanges in Florida. So that’s probably a piece. It's hard for us to quantify because I don’t have this information by market, I have got it by state. But we do see some reduction in covered lives and again that’s through the end of June. With all that being said, reform is still playing out as we expected in terms of impact of HCA's earnings. And Bill, if you need to add?
William Rutherford: Yes. I will just try to add. We did go back and look at last year to see whether that changed. We think the growth of that 480 admissions has grown about 320. So roughly 130 or so in the prior year. So it moved up. If you look at that as a percentage of our total exchange activity it’s roughly 3.5% which may fall in line with some of those macro studies that we see.
Operator: And we will go next to Sheryl Skolnick of Mizuho Securities.
Sheryl Skolnick: Thank you very much and appreciate all that, especially the passion with which Sam describes what he is doing to fix the labor cost issue. One of the things you also attributed to, and good job on that, thank you, one of the things that you also attributed the weakness in the quarter on the EBITDA line to, but I'm not getting that sense here, is to payer-mix. And in particular either a slowdown or clearly not a decline but some sort of slowdown in managed care. And I'm wondering if we can explore that a little bit, especially given the statistics you gave with a 48% increase in exchange related managed care lives year-over-year and very strong components of revenue from managed care and clearly you're still able to get pricing there. But can we explore that issue? And if it's not as big a factor as you perhaps thought it was on the preview, give us some comfort as to why this external issue isn't likely to be a factor going forward? Because everything else you can control, that's something, to some extent you can control and to some extent you might not be. So tell us what's going on with managed care please.
Victor Campbell: All right, Sheryl. Thank you. Good question and Sam you want to lead on this one?
Samuel Hazen: Yes. Let me say this from the historic. I don’t think in any of our markets there is any structural changes that have occurred with our relationships with commercial payers that would suggest we are in any significant way begin steered away from or out of contract or any of that. That is not the case. The company is locked in on the number and the available contract today just as we were last year and as we look forward to 2016 and 2017, we are roughly 75% contracted on '16 and 50% contracted on '17 at very consistent terms with recent past year. So for the quarter we were up what, 1.8% on adjusted admissions. That is slightly down from where we were in the first part of the year. I think the first part of the year Sheryl, benefitted from the first quarter in particular where our exchange comp against last year was quite a bit positive. And so our trend of about 2% in this quarter is not that far off where we expect it to be. We actually grew our revenue at almost 6% in the third quarter compared to 7.7% year-to-date. So it is off a bit when I look at that, but there is nothing to suggest that the economy across HCA's 42 markets has dramatically changed or any other competitive dynamic has had an impact on our business. There is a normal ebb and flow to our business and sometimes it's hard to discern exactly why it trends down a bit. But I was reasonably encouraged by the fact that we still saw volume growth in our commercial book of business in the third quarter of 2%. That was a positive indicator for me. And it suggests that there is still growing demand in that particular segment of the business and it's very important as you know. So I can't put anything on it at this particular point in time. Obviously, if we get the second quarter market share data and we start to see early reads on third quarter market share data, it will give me some better insights into whether or not we had a market share loss potentially in the third quarter which I don’t believe is the case. So right now there is not a lot to point to. I will reemphasize that in my comments, I mean our managed care delivery volume was up 5.7%, that’s a very strong number. Our emergency room visits were up 3.5% and within some other outpatient areas we had solid growth on the commercial side as well. So that’s sort of my take at this particular point. As I get more external data sources, I will be able to check my thinking on those particular assumption.
William Rutherford: And Sam, too, I think we had a really tough comp to last year. We had a favorable comp in the first quarter but the third quarter of last year I think was a, created a more difficult comp with respect to the growth rate over prior year.
Operator: And we will go next to A.J. Rice of UBS.
A.J. Rice: I want to come back to some of Bill's comments about the uninsured pickup you saw. I think there was a reference to, there was a slowdown in Medicaid process in Kansas and Texas. Is that something where you have got a bolus of patients that therefore you are going to maybe get incremental reimbursement in the fourth quarter? And I am going to broaden it out a little bit on the uninsured. I've been asked about repeatedly, about your ER investments and whether that's potentially some of the early volume you see there in the freestanding or associated with your facilities. Is that in any way driving incremental uninsured? And then also any comment on the Texas oil price drop and whether that might be having an impact?
Samuel Hazen: Well, Bill's going to answer it, but I want to add one more comment to what I said a moment ago about commercial volume. I was just looking over the last 11 quarters. In the third quarter we had the most adjusted admissions for our commercial book of business then we have ever had over that same time period. So, yes, it was a challenge then when we were up but the number we had in the third quarter was the highest number we had ever had. So, sorry, Bill?
William Rutherford: Yes. A.J., let me try to address the other questions that you have. One, specifically on what we cited as what we think is a slowdown in processing some Medicaid application in Texas and Kansas. We are hopeful those are temporary and as the state kind of goes through processing those then we will begin to see those covered on Medicaid. But that’s really reflecting itself in a low conversion rate in both Texas and Kansas. And again, we attribute maybe a quarter of our 4000 or so uninsured growth relative to that issue. So we are hopeful that does correct itself going forward. On kind of broader uninsured trends in the ED, we are seeing a growth in ED volume and that has a corresponding growth of uninsured ED but you had as Sam mentioned a lot of other kind of commercial and uninsured ED growth to kind of offset that.
Samuel Hazen: And I think the payer mix, Bill, in the emergency room was about the same as this.
William Rutherford: Pretty [possible] [ph]. When you look at uninsured as a percent, it still gets to around that 20% level. So it hasn’t materially changed on us. And then Texas oil. Texas oil, I have not seen anything. When we look at Houston uninsureds, it's no more pronounced than any other markets that we have across the company.
Samuel Hazen: Clearly the oil economy have had some impact on Houston in particular and then some sprinkled impact across other Texas markets. However, the Texas economy is so strong that there still reported job growth even in Houston and obviously in the other markets and we are seeing that in the demand that we are studying within the Texas markets.
William Rutherford: And then one last one, A.J., I think you asked, the freestanding ED strategy we have really does not impact in any of our uninsured trends.
Operator: And we will go next to John Ransom of Raymond James.
John Ransom: Can you just talk a little bit about your expectations for 4Q and what you see relative to business mix and staffing that may be different than 3Q? Thanks.
Samuel Hazen: All right, I don’t know how much we can really address 4Q.
William Rutherford: Well, I think our guidance states it pretty clearly as far as the expectation goes. As far as the...
John Ransom: In other words, your guidance didn't really change that much from 4Q, so obviously you are seeing some of these issues as temporary. So just a little more color would be great. Thanks.
William Rutherford: Well, I think at a high level, John, we clearly as you just heard, I think Sam described we are expecting to see improvement in the productivity. Again we have already, we have implemented actions. We will continue to implement other actions during the quarter that we hope will show results here in the fourth quarter. So I mentioned in my earlier comments, some around the implementations of actions around contract labor. Maybe more the intermediate term, certainly hope to have some impact in the fourth quarter. But that’s solving a turnover issue is a little bit longer term issue. You know basically we see continued top line growth that gives us lot of encouragement about the fourth quarter. And then we think -- we have taken actions around some of the initiatives that Sam mentioned. So I think the outlook for the fourth quarter is reasonable and I am comfortable with our guidance.
John Ransom: And just on that point -- sorry, go ahead. I'm sorry. So on that point, is there any reason to think 4Q, 2015 will be any more seasonal than 4Q '14? Are you seeing elective procedures getting pushed further and further back?
Samuel Hazen: No, I don’t think so. As we know Q4 is generally one of our strongest quarters that I don’t see '15 being any seasonally different then maybe what we have experienced in the recent past.
Operator: And we will go next to Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan: I will change gears, here. Maybe on the DC front, obviously a lot of talk about how to deal with this, addressing the Part B premium increases for Medicare beneficiaries, talk of cuts for provider or for the program. Could you talk and provide us your view on how you see that playing out and how you see hospitals exposed on that issue? Thanks.
Victor Campbell: Sorry, Frank. I will go ahead and do this. I guess number one, I think everybody has probably seen or heard there was a bill proposed, put together last night. It's our understanding that the house will likely vote on it this week and send it next week. I really haven't read all the 144 pages, I haven't read hardly any of it. But I have seen few synopsis here and there. I guess on the front side, number one, it is still proposed so we will see where it comes out at the end. First, we don’t like any reductions in Medicare payments ever. But having said that, we also know that on more than one occasion we have to help for the better good of whatever. The one reduction which is in there which we have seen before is the extension of the sequester now going out to 2025. And then I think the only other Medicare reimbursement related reduction or going forward relates to some outpatient, off campus changes. And I guess what I can say there, number one, they are prospective as to future transactions. So that’s what's a good thing. It's not anything retroactive and it's not a straight cut. So we will study that closely. But I never want to say it cuts good but I have seen worse cuts.
Frank Morgan: But this is essentially backend loaded so it wouldn’t affect 2016.
Victor Campbell: I think that’s fair.
Operator: And we will go next to Whit Mayo of Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo: Can you just remind me where we are today on Texas UPL and the indigent care program? I know it was $142 million headwind versus last year. I feel like there was another $70 million number that I had in my notes. And then maybe just remind us where you are on the $100 million of investments that you talked about earlier this year?
Victor Campbell: All right. You are sneaking in two questions. But we will let you have that. So somebody is going to address Texas UPL and then we will talk about the investments. Bill, you want the UPL piece?
William Rutherford: Yes. Well, on Texas waiver program, we really haven't seen any material changes in that program. In the quarter we recorded about $87 million of waiver revenue which is really consistent and almost exact same that we recorded in Q2. So that’s remained consistent for us. The $142 million you mentioned was an adjustment we recorded in the second quarter of last year and we have kind of adjusted for that. We did anticipate earlier in the year a potential reduction in the waiver revenue but we set, I believe in last quarter we no longer anticipated that. So our waiver revenue accrual we are recording this, is really consistent throughout 2015.
Samuel Hazen: Yes. On the corporate initiative and so forth -- this is Sam -- the third quarter was a high watermark for the implementation of a couple of our initiatives. On the HR side as I said, we are deeper, almost halfway through our rollout. Maybe even two-thirds the way through our rollout on our One HR and we did have a significant cost variance compared to the third quarter last year and our overall HR cost center. And then on the clinical IT side, again, the third quarter was a fairly large quarter with respect to a number of company initiatives to improve our clinical IT capabilities and put ourselves in a better position with our physicians and enhance our nurses ability to deliver care and then just to improve our clinical data warehouse. So those are all components of the third quarter. It presented some comparison and challenges. We are pretty much at a high watermark on our HR spend and that will level out. IT continues to be an opportunity for the company and we will have some incremental growth there and we are going through our planning process for 2016. As we speak to make sure our priorities are lined up with where they need to be for the next few years.
Operator: And we will go next to Andrew Schenker of Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker: So just on rehab and behavioral growth, both had extremely strong growth in the quarter here. Maybe if you could just discuss your investments in these areas and maybe the room for continued growth for both of them. Thank you.
Victor Campbell: Sam, line is yours.
Samuel Hazen: Both of these components of our business continue to perform very well for us. And keep in mind they only represent about 7.5% of our total admissions. Behavioral representing about 6% and rehab representing about 1.5%. We have ongoing development of new units in expansion of existing units in motion as we speak. In some instances that’s to actually add service line capability in certain markets and then in others it's to add capacity in order to deal with our occupancy levels and the constraints that we have got for growth with respect to that. They both are very central to service lines for HCA. The behavioral health service line is very central to being able to manage our emergency room service line very effectively. And then rehab is very central to our neurosciences and trauma program. So they are very complementary on that front. And we will continue to leverage components of those strategy in a collaborative way, if you will, to advance our position. The capital investment on these is small in the overall scheme of HCA's $2.7 billion of spend that we intend to pay for next year. So it's not a very significant component of that total spend but it is significant with respect to those particular service lines.
Operator: And we will go next to Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Just a question on exchanges. So as we think about going into the open enrollment season, are there any initiatives that you guys can put in place or are already putting in place to drive exchange enrollment? We saw the rates come out yesterday. Is there anything related to that that you can do to put the message across to currently uninsured folks? Thank you
William Rutherford: Yes. Thank you, Brian. This is Bill. Last year we stepped up our efforts in our communities. We partnered with several agencies including Enroll America and others, to try to reach out inside our communities where we believe still uninsured people have the opportunity to participate. We are going to continue to do that in our enrollment period. We have a team and a committee of people that are working with our local markets and some third party agencies where we will be sponsoring community agencies, participating with other community events and trying to reach out to the uninsured volume in our communities that we think still are able for subsidies. We are trying to target that very thoughtfully in some of our key and larger markets where we have data that suggests there is still opportunity there. So I would characterize that we are active in that space and we are working diligently to try to reach out to that community.
Victor Campbell: And Brian, I would add, I think most of you saw HHS, they have put projections which are pretty conservative I think, going into next year. But the good news is, they also cited that they were going to put increased efforts in five different markets. The good news is three of those five happen to be important market to us. One is Houston, one is Dallas and one is Miami. We don’t care much about their New Jersey effort or wherever their other one was, but those are three good ones for us. So thank you.
Operator: And we will go next to Ralph Giacobbe of Citi.
Ralph Giacobbe: Is the higher bad debt simply a reflection of the uninsured or is there anything else going on in terms of how you are treating discounts versus charity or collections on the insured piece? And then just real quick, as somewhat of a follow-up. The pricing stat on the inpatient side is sort of flattish. Could you just help reconcile that versus the revenue per adjusted admission. Thanks.
Victor Campbell: All right. So, Bill, do you want to...?
William Rutherford: Let me try kind of your bad debts and Ralph thanks for the question. As you know we have historically looked at the total uncompensated care which includes bad debts and uninsured and charity. And from period to period you can't get some movement from one or the other. With our slowdown and pending Medicaid conversions we saw this quarter, that does put a little bit more in the allowance through doubtful accounts which flows through for bad debts. But our total uncompensated care generally is moving in concert with what our uninsured trends are. We have seen recent growth or continued growth of co-pays and deductibles. That’s not recent. Our collection rates are staying really consistent with where they have been in the prior years. So we are not really seeing any erosion in collection. So even though the co-pays and deductibles have grown, our collection rates amounts have remained stable. And so the largest factor on our uncompensated care continues to remain the uninsured growth. On the inpatients data, we need to get back with you on that -- we need to flow through on that.
Victor Campbell: Yes. We will follow up on that one, Ralph. I am not sure anybody has that answer.
Operator: And we will go next to Gary Taylor of JPMorgan.
Gary Taylor: One question, three parts if you will indulge me. First, did I miss the charity and discount disclosure? I was listening but maybe I didn't write it down?
William Rutherford: You missed it. I will be happy to give it to you again, Gary. Let me pull it up. So our same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $525 million. Charity care totaled 914 which was a decline of 117 from the prior year. Uninsured discounts totaled 2.755 which was an increase of 642.
Victor Campbell: Right. You simply didn’t listen. I am not sure we will let you do the other two pieces.
Gary Taylor: Oh, I get dinged. It's all related. Real quickly. I know at one point, you were writing -- or early in '14 you were writing off 100% of the inpatient self-pay via charity and discount and none of that was really flowing through to the net revenue before bad debt. Is that still true? Or it sounds like maybe, from your answer to the last question, maybe some of that is changing with the Medicaid pending?
William Rutherford: Yes. Let me just try to clarify. So we have a charity care policy that if you meet our charity guidelines, we do write off 100% of your bill. If you don’t meet our charity guidelines and you are uninsured, we apply an uninsured discount which is basically reflective of what you would be billed if you are insured. So it's not 100% but it's a substantial portion of your bill is written off on uninsured discount and then the residual then goes through kind of the bad debt line item. But you also have movements going on with Medicaid and pending Medicaid that affects those items as well.
Gary Taylor: Okay. That's very typical treatment. So I must have misunderstood. My last question is, can you just give us an update on co-pay and deductible as a percentage of revenue? And could you be clear as to whether that's before or after contractual discounts or any other discounts or bad debt? Kind of how do you size what co-pay deductibles look like?
Samuel Hazen: Yes. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen over the past recent years a growth in the patient liability related to co-pays and deductibles. And we still see that. I call that a net 10% to 12% on a per account basis. But our collections have remained relatively stable. We have said and we validated this recently about a 30% of our write-offs were attributable to kind of deductible and cos and the balance to uninsured. That really has not changed and the data that we have seen. So I would tell you that the deductible and co-pay environments have been relatively stable for us, relative on a material way to our trends.
William Rutherford: And some of that we are still collecting upfront.
Samuel Hazen: And we still collected at least a third of that upfront.
Operator: And we will go next to Brian Wright of Sterne Agee.
Brian Wright: Was there any impact at all of fewer weekdays post-Labor Day this quarter?
Victor Campbell: Anybody want that?
William Rutherford: Not that we [indiscernible].
Victor Campbell: I think we got three no's.
Brian Wright: Fair enough. And then just one clarification. The ACA EBITDA impact on the quarter, was that 6% or 6.5%? I just didn't get it all down.
William Rutherford: You know as we roll out the pieces that we do track, it's just under 6%.
Brian Wright: Just under 6%. Okay. Thank you.
Victor Campbell: And I think we got time for one last question.
Operator: And we will take our final question from Paula Torch of Avondale Partners.
Paula Torch: Thank you for fitting me in. So you gave us some great color on labor and cost but I was wondering if we could talk a little bit more about potential for wage rate increases as we move into next year? Should we expect to see more of an inflationary environment on that front? And if so, could you talk more about your ability to manage through it? Thank you.
Samuel Hazen: Well, we have routine studies. This is Sam. We have routine studies that we do within each of our markets twice a year in order to understand our competitive positioning with respect to wages. And as we sort through those analysis and those different issues, we try to make timely adjustments. So as a routine we are making market specific adjustments to remain as competitive as we possibly can. So those are specific market issues. Across all HCA markets I think it's reasonable to assume that there will be some increase in wages in our trends over the next few years. I don’t think it is anything that is overly material or something that we cannot manage through effectively. We obviously try to short cycle our commercial contracts in a way to line up with any acceleration in wages so that we can adjust our commercial pricing to sync up with overall pressures on inflation, mainly in the wage and then secondarily on the supply side. So I think from that standpoint we are in a pretty good spot as well. But right now we are of the mindset that our trends are generally reflective of current market conditions with maybe some modest acceleration in a few pockets here and there. But we think it's manageable in the short run.
Victor Campbell: All right. Paula, thank you very much. And I want to thank everyone and hopefully I didn’t offend anybody from New Jersey with my comments earlier. It was not intended. Anyway, you all have a great day.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thank you, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome on the call today, including those on the webcast. With me here this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO and Executive Vice President. Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's fourth quarter earnings release. As you know, the call is being recorded and a replay will be made available later today. With that, let me turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: All right. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or the webcast. I hope you've had a chance to review the press release we issued this morning. This morning we released our complete second quarter 2015 earnings, which is consistent with the company's preview on July 15. I'll make a few remarks and then I'll turn the call over to Sam and Bill to provide more detail on the quarter's results. Overall, we're very pleased with the second quarter performance. Consistent with recent trends, the quarter's performance highlighted a strong volume growth, solid expense management and favorable service and payer mix. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $2.008 billion in the quarter compared to $2 billion last year, and remember that last year included an increase of $142 million in Texas Medicaid Waiver revenue. Excluding the Waiver revenue adjustment from 2014 results, adjusted EBITDA increased 8.1% over the prior year. And if you normalize for the Waiver payment and contact incentive income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 9.7% over the second quarter of last year, with adjusted EBITDA margin increasing by 20 basis points. Earnings per diluted share adjusted to exclude losses and gains on sales, facilities and losses on retirement of debt was $1.37 for the second quarter, above 2015 and 2014. Further adjusting for the $0.20 per share related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver revenue from the second quarter of 2014 results, adjusted earnings per diluted share would have increased 17.1% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014. The company had another strong volume quarter with same-facility equivalent admission growth of 4.9% and same-facility admission growth of 4.1% compared to the prior year second quarter. Once again, the strength in volume was broad-based across our markets and our service lines. Our same-facility ER visits increased 7.4% compared to last year while surgical volumes once again showed solid growth compared to the prior year. We continue to see positive trends in overall market share gains based on the latest data available. Sam will provide more insight into our market share and volume trends in a moment. Obviously, we're pleased that the Supreme Court has upheld subsidies for enrollees on federally facilitated exchanges. The decision was a positive outcome for our patients, employees and shareholders. As we have said before, we support efforts that improve access by providing affordable coverage for the uninsured. We are pleased to have this decision behind us as we continue efforts to pursue further coverage expansion. With respect to the second quarter of this year, we continue to see the positive effects of the ACA, consistent with our expectations. Bill will provide additional detail in a moment. Based on the results in the first six months of 2015, we are updating our full-year 2015 guidance for adjusted EBITDA to near the high end of our previous range of $7.55 billion to $7.85 billion and to near the high end of our adjusted EPS range of $4.90 to $5.30 per share. This reflects our stronger than anticipated volume growth year to date. We now estimate that our equivalent admission growth will be in the range of 4% to 5% for the full-year 2015. I encourage you to review the assumptions embedded in our guidance, which are included in our release this morning. We had a good cash flow quarter, with cash flow from operations totaling $1.057 billion. While down $193 million from the previous year, this is primarily due to an increase of $301 million in income taxes this year. We deployed $558 million in capital spending into our markets and also used $574 million to repurchase 7.347 million shares of our common stock. At June 30, we had repurchased 12.552 million shares under our February 2015 share repurchase authorization and we had $1.06 billion authorization remaining inclusive of our May 2015 share repurchase authorization. I would like to take this opportunity to say how pleased we are to have Tenet Healthcare joining HealthTrust Purchasing Group early next year as a partner member. In 2014, HPG's total supply spend exceeded $23 billion, with approximately 1,350 acute care facilities as members. HPG was selected for supply chain cost management solutions, including immediate contract value and depth of supply chain management expertise. The addition of Tenet will enhance HPG's ability to drive sustained supply cost savings for its memberships. And in closing, I'm very pleased with the consistent execution by our clinical and operations teams to deliver high-quality patient outcomes and volume growth. Patient safety, quality of care and patient experience are key components of our patient-centric model as we look to strengthen our delivery system capabilities and broaden our access points and our markets. We believe this will continue to position us well in delivering value for all stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Great. Thank you, Milton. And good morning, everyone. As Milton indicated, we had a good quarter driven by strong volume growth and solid expense management. I'll provide more details on our performance and our health reform trends in the second quarter. As we reported, in the second quarter our same-facility admissions increased 4.1% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 4.9%. Sam will provide more commentary on the drivers of this volume in a moment, but I'll give you some trends by payer class. During the second quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.9% and 3.8%, respectively. This does include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 11.2% on a same-facility basis and now represent 32.7% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 5.1% and 7.9%, respectively, in the quarter, fairly consistent with recent trends. We continue to see strength in our six expansion states, but also have seen strength in our non-expansion states as well. I'll provide additional comments on Medicaid in my health reform remarks. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 8.7% in the quarter. These represent 7.1% of our total admissions compared to 6.8% in the second quarter of last year. This is a change of trend from recent quarters. However, let me remind everyone that in last year's second quarter, we had a bit of movement between our uninsured and pending Medicaid numbers as states were slowed by the volume of applications in the early period of expansion. As we've talked about before, I believe it's more meaningful to look at these trends over a longer period. Year-to-date, our same-facility uninsured admissions are down 2.4% from same period last year. Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions, increased 4.3%, and equivalent admissions increased 4.7% on a same-facility basis in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 7.4% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and same-facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 19.3% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 20.6% last year. Intensity of service or acuity moderately increased in the quarter, with our same-facility case mix increasing 0.7% compared to the prior-year period. Same-facility surgeries increased 1.4% in the quarter, with same-facility inpatient surgeries increasing 2% and outpatient surgeries increasing 1% from the prior year. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.8% after excluding from second quarter of 2014 revenues the $142 million Texas Waiver adjustment we recognized in the second quarter of last year. Our international division reduced our reported revenue per equivalent admission by approximately 40 basis points, principally due to currency conversion rates, which was similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Same-facility managed care and other, which includes exchange, revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.6% in the quarter. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $269 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care discounts totaled $884 million, a decline of $13 million from the prior-year period, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.415 billion or an increase of $282 million over the prior-year period. Now turning to expenses. Our expense management in the quarter was, again, very strong. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.5% compared to last year's second quarter. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins adjusted for the share-based compensation, high-tech revenue and prior Waiver adjustment was up 20 basis points in the second quarter and year-to-date is up 100 basis points from the prior year when adjusted for these items. Same-facility salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.9% compared to last year's second quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues increased 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2014 when you exclude the $142 million Waiver adjustment from prior-year revenues. Same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 3.2% for the second quarter compared to the prior-year period. I believe a part of this reflects our growth in surgical volumes along with some isolated pressures in pharmaceuticals and some commodity items in the quarter. Other operating expenses improved 10 basis points from last year's second quarter to 17.7% of revenues and we did recognize $18 million in electronic health record income compared to $35 million in last year's second quarter, consistent with our expectations. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter, with cash flows from operating totaling $1.057 billion. Year-to-date, cash flows from operations were $2.75 billion or a 22.6% increase from prior year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.627 billion available under our revolving credit facilities and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.84 times at June 30 of 2015 compared to 3.96 times at December 31 of 2014. So let me touch briefly on healthcare reform. Health reform activity was strong for the quarter. In the second quarter, we saw approximately 11,600 same-facility exchange admissions as compared to the 5,600 we saw in the second quarter of last year. You recall we saw about 9,800 exchange admissions in the first quarter for an 18% increase quarter-to-quarter. And we believe this is largely due to the continuing new enrollment. We saw approximately 44,700 same-facility exchange ER visits in the second quarter compared to 19,400 in the second quarter of 2014 and 36,900 in the first quarter of 2015. We have history on about 45% of our second quarter HIX volume. And based on our look back at previous coverage, we still estimate about 40% of these admissions were uninsured prior to health reform. In our six expansion states, same-facility uninsured admissions were up 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2014 and Medicaid admissions were up 16% for the quarter. But on a year-to-date basis, in our expansion states, uninsured admissions are down 39% and Medicaid admissions are up 22.9%. When we roll all the components of health reform that we can track, we currently estimate health reform contributed to just under 6% of our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and the overall benefit is in line with our expectations. So that concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: Good morning. As mentioned earlier, volume growth was strong in the second quarter, with no unusual factors contributing to the quarter's growth. As I stated on previous earnings calls, we believe this performance continues to reflect improving macroeconomic trends in many of our markets and market share gains for the company. We believe the market share gains have been driven by a combination of solid execution of our growth agenda and capital spending that has been invested, both to increase access to our networks and to add operational capacity. Our growth in volume was once again broad-based across most of the companies' markets and it was also broad-based across the various service lines of our business. On a year-over-year basis, for the quarter all of our 14 domestic divisions had growth in admissions, growth in adjusted admissions and growth in emergency room visits. All but three divisions had growth in managed care and exchange admissions and all but one of our divisions had growth in adjusted admissions for these same-payer classes. Managed care and exchange emergency room visits grew by 8%. All but one division had growth in emergency room visits for these payer classes. All but three divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Surgical admissions accounted for 27.1% of total admissions for the quarter, down slightly from 27.7% in the second quarter of the previous year. This quarter is the ninth straight quarter with growth in inpatient surgeries. Nine divisions had growth in hospital-based outpatient surgeries, which were up 0.9% for the company. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes have grown in eight out of the last nine quarters. Surgeries grew 1.1% in our ambulatory surgery division. We believe that many components of our OR of Choice initiative that are working inside of our hospitals are now contributing to our growth in this division. Additionally, we've recently acquired four new surgery centers in existing markets inside of our ambulatory surgery division. Most service lines had some level of surgical growth, with notable growth in orthopedics and cardiovascular surgery. Other categories of our inpatient business were strong also. Deliveries for the quarter were up 2.4%, managed care and exchange deliveries were up 7.3%, neonatal admissions grew 4.6%, behavioral health admissions were up 7.2%, rehab admissions were up 9.9% and average length of stay grew by 1.7%, reflecting the higher case mix and acuity of our admissions. On a same-facility basis after excluding the Texas Medicaid Waiver revenue adjustment from last year, inpatient revenue for the company grew 5.8%. Outpatient revenue for the company grew 12.5% in the quarter on a consolidated basis and represented 39.9% of total patient revenues. On a same-facility basis, outpatient revenue grew by 9%. Market share trends for the company's inpatient business for the 12-month period ended December 2014 were generally consistent with past trends. Our market share grew by 22 basis points. As a result, the company's composite market share is around 24.5%. Approximately 68% of our markets increased share across most service line categories. Overall inpatient demand across HCA markets continued to show sequential strength. Demand growth accelerated in our markets in each of the last three quarters of 2014, with the fourth quarter showing growth of 3.5%. Commercial demand in HCA markets was even more notable for the year, with an increase of over 4%, with sequential acceleration in each quarter. We believe inpatient demand in both the first and second quarters of 2015 were equally strong. We will report on these quarters when the data is available. HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda that we believe is driving sustainable market share gains and overall results. We continue to invest in our local networks at significant levels. The anticipated increase in capital spending that we announced last quarter will provide over the next few years more capital in our markets to add inpatient bed capacity, increase emergency room capacity, enhanced service line offerings and add equipment for our nurses and for our physicians. In certain markets, capital spending will be deployed for new hospitals and new outpatient facilities. And finally, managed care and exchange contracting continued to progress as planned. The company is currently contracted for almost 96% of its revenue for 2015, 67% of its revenue for 2016 and 45% of its revenue for 2017. The pricing and the non-pricing terms are generally consistent with the contracts we have renewed over the past couple of years. With that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you, Sam. Tracy, if you could come back on and we'll start taking questions. As we always do, I encourage each of you to hold your questions to one at a time and give everybody a chance to ask their question. Tracy?
Operator: Thank you. And we'll go first to A. J. Rice from UBS.
A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Hi, everybody. I'm going to slip in a technical question and then ask a broader one. Just the technical question is if you've got this Texas Medicaid Waiver money coming in, is it just in your mind too small to bother to raise the guidance, or why aren't you raising the guidance for the back half of the year, or is there offsets (22:11)? But then the broader question is one that I got on the preannouncement from a number of people. How do we think about the pull-through on your volumes? When you got the volume strength that you had, some quarters it really seems to leverage down the income statement and, other quarters, maybe the leverage is less than what we thought. I don't know whether that's because you make investments with some of the upside that you have, whether there's some stair-step to the staffing requirements. But I wanted to just conceptually think about that question of, how do we think about volume leverage working its way down the income statement from quarter-to-quarter?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Hi, A. J. I hate to let the first guy cheat, but we'll let you. We'll do two. The technical question on the Waiver and guidance Bill will address and then Sam will talk about pull-through.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Hey, A. J. Let me talk a little bit about the Waiver and your question regarding adjusting our guidance on there. We did make an adjustment in the second quarter of 2015 based on some updated information from CMS on our Waiver program. We recognized an estimated increase, about $17 million related to the program in the second quarter. Based on the program updates that we mentioned, we now believe the Waiver revenues to be recognized in 2015 will be materially equivalent to the amounts we recognized in 2014, which excludes the impact of the $142 million settlement we recorded last year. You're right, our original guidance did include an anticipated $70 million reductions, which we no longer anticipate this reduction. Roughly half of this we've already recognized in our year-to-date performance between the first and second quarter, and the rest coming through the second half. So the remaining amount, that $35 million or so, we didn't deem to be material by itself to cause us to raise guidance again, but it does contribute really to our belief we'll be near the high-end of the guidance. So, Sam, I'll let you take the second part.
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: Let me start off this way, A. J. First, our margin in the second quarter was well ahead of our internal plan, I'll tell you that. The second point I want to make is our margin in the second quarter compared really to first quarter and the fourth quarter, which is truly the run rate of the company, zero change, almost identical margins for the company in each of those three consecutive quarters. And then when I look at our operating expense per adjusted admission, it's hardly unchanged from fourth quarter to first quarter to second quarter. And the volumes are very, very comparable. The other thing is we did some margin expansion in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis of 20 basis points. It was not as high as the first quarter, which was uniquely high with our clearance overall. Some differences between the second quarter and the first quarter, although not incredibly material on each front, but somewhat material and I think contributed to the differences between the second quarter clearance and the first quarter clearance, is the volume in the second quarter wasn't as strong. It was strong, ahead of plan, but not as strong as the first quarter. So there's some lost leverage comparing those two. The second big macro point is the reform benefit for the company over second quarter-over-second quarter of last year was not as material as first quarter-over-first quarter of last year. And Bill can give you the specifics on that if we need to. And then at a micro level, I'll tell you there were a few pressure points for the company on some labor cost due to the fact that we had more vacancies in the first quarter because our volume picked up a little bit more than we anticipated. And we filled some of those in the latter part of the first quarter and that carried into the second quarter. The other thing I would say, is the company's initiatives that I laid out in our guidance for 2015 ramped up a little bit more in the second quarter than they did in the first quarter. So that had a modest impact. And then the third point is we are seeing some acceleration in drug costs, which have been in the press, it's been in the political arena and so forth. We're feeling that in our pharmaceutical cost trends somewhat and that puts some pressure on our margins in the second quarter. I'll tell you this, the company is focused on margin enhancements, like it always has been. We're continually trying to find ways to leverage the scale of the organization, use our technology and our data more effectively to identify efficiency opportunities and improvement opportunities. And we continue to believe as we ramp up volume growth, we will be able to leverage the operating costs of the company and create margin expansion. And then when you couple that with our growth initiatives, which are centered on high-margin service expansion, high-margin investments, we think the combination of those two things will continue to put the company in a very solid position with this operating margin.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you, A. J. Appreciate it. Move on to the next question.
Operator: We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick from Mizuho Securities.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you very much. This is really an outstanding performance and it's really, in my opinion, a shame that the market is not giving you a little bit more credit for it, especially in view of the volume performance we've seen from everyone else. But that's not a question and this is. Can you focus a little bit, please, on the increase in the bad debt number? Was that related to what you saw in self-pay and/or was it related to some consideration of balance after? And do you think that this sort of thing is something we should model in as sustainable? Sorry to ask (28:01).
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thanks, Sheryl. Bill will address that.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey. Good morning, Sheryl. Let me try to cover that. It's a good question. Let me touch on uninsured volume trends and then relate that into bad debts and uncompensated care because there are a couple of things that we should point out here. Overall, the second quarter year over trends are a little bit artificially affected by the pending Medicaid activity we saw in our expansion states last year. So recall we had quite a bit of movement going on in both our uninsured and Medicaid categories in the second quarter, where the buildup in pending Medicaid in the first quarter of last year that got cleared out in the second quarter which lowered your uninsured trends when you look at the second quarter alone. And so let me look at uninsured volumes on a year-to-date basis first just to account for that early period of reform. On a year-to-date basis, as I mentioned in my comments, our uninsured admissions are down 2.4%. We finished full-year 2014 down just over 9%. So, the slowing of uninsured declines is, we believe, largely attributable to the fact we didn't really have any new states other than Indiana expand Medicaid. So these year-over-year trends are beginning to normalize and sunset on us. And by the way, it's pretty much in line with our expectations and what we're seeing in other areas of our volume. Relative to bad debts, as we talked about before, I think people understand we have a pretty robust charity and uninsured discount policy. And so we think it's best to look at uncompensated care in total because, in any quarter, there can be some movement between bad debt, charity and uninsured discounts. And we saw that in the second quarter because of some of these payer class movements. Our uncompensated care, as a percentage of revenue adjusted for the uncompensated care was 30.7% in Q2 of 2015; it was 29.0% in Q2 of 2014. So slight growth. But it was 30.3% in Q4 of 2014 and 29.6% in Q1. So it's a manageable level of growth. On a year-to-date basis, our uncompensated care is 30.1% versus 30.3% as a percentage of revenue. So there's still some improvement on the year-to-date, but we do believe some of those trends are beginning to sunset on us as we see not as much lift on year-over-year of reform. We do continue to see some growth in deductibles and co-pay amounts. You mentioned this balance after the bill. We feel we've got really strong collection practices. Our collections per account are staying really consistent with where they've historically been, but we are seeing a little bit higher per account liability. And that tends to affect bad debt slightly. But overall, I think we feel pretty strong about what our collection practices are.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sheryl, thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning. Just to follow up on that comment, Bill...
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: ...and this is probably broader. As we think about healthcare reform, it sounds like the tailwind from the recent implementation of the law is starting to taper off. So as we look out two years to three years, we've heard a lot of investors ask about the air pocket that we could potentially see in 2017, whether it's the Cadillac Tax changes and all that. How do you guys see healthcare reform playing out? And just your outlook without going into guidance over the next three years.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Let me start and maybe Milton will add in. I kind of see, on a year-over-year basis, the enrollment for this year is really what's driving the growth. And with the increased enrollment, we are seeing increased reform activity. I think as we saw last year, we saw that level off in second and third quarter, and it picked up again with first quarter with the new enrollment. I think this year within the year, we might begin and see some leveling off. But I think next year's performance will largely be attributable to the enrollment that we might see. We do think there's some kind of key points of the law that may incentivize people to find enrollment. And so I do think there will continue to be some tailwinds in reform, at least for next year. Not so sure longer term we'll have the visibility into that. So...
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Milt, do you want to add?
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, let me just reinforce maybe than add something new, but reinforce Bill's comments around last year, we had some movement from pending Medicaid out of uninsured. And so really we look at the number on a year-to-date basis. We've said that last year in the second quarter comments, and I'd just reinforce that. I think that's important. I don't want to get too alarmed about the particular second quarter growth in uninsured admissions because of that comp to last year. Also, as I think about reform going forward, I do think we'll continue to see continued growth in enrollment next year with reform. The CEO (33:04), of course, projects that as well. I think you'll see more material – that the penalty tax will materially increase next year for those who choose not to seek health insurance coverage. And that may drive more enrollment. And then you're going to see employers with as few as 50 employees having to provide health insurance to their employees to avoid a penalty at the employer level. So there's still some implementation pieces of reform that we've yet to see and so I want to reinforce that out into the market and not react too much to this second quarter because of the comp situation that we had last year.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you, Brian. Next question?
Operator: We'll go next to Frank Morgan from RBC Capital.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning. As I look at your cash flows, strong cash flow trends so far year-to-date, it looks like you beat, actually a little bit ahead of your full-year trend line run rate. I was just wondering if you've got anything we should be considering about what might happen in the second half of the year because I think typically that is your stronger part of the year. Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Bill, do you want to address that?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I mean, I think we're still projecting our cash flow from operations to be somewhere between $4 billion and $4.250 billion for full year. And I think we feel pretty good about that number. If you look at kind of a year-to-date, as I said, $2.075 billion, so that does imply a little bit of growth in the second half of the year. As you said, last year, second half of the year was really strong as we saw the core growth of HCA continue to prosper. There's really no reason to think that shouldn't continue for the second half of this year.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you, Frank.
Operator: We'll go next to Matt Borsch from Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Thank you. Wanted to just ask, if I could, on the surgeries. You mentioned inpatient surgeries growing faster than outpatient. That's not a normal trend, and I'm wondering if you could comment on that and if you expect that will continue.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Matt, thank you. Sam, you want that one?
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: I was speaking to the volume growth inside of HCA. I think your point about overall demand for outpatient surgery outpacing inpatient demand is probably an accurate statement. We don't get great information with respect to market share data for outpatient surgery, so it's difficult for us to assess our overall performance there. It's clear in a lot of our markets there's are more suppliers of outpatient surgery than there are inpatient surgery, and so that could be part of the dynamic that we're seeing as an organization. We have, though, changed the trend curve for HCA on outpatient surgeries over the past two years or three years with our Surgical Growth Initiative and our OR of Choice efforts, and we've turned the trend line positive in the face of significant competition. So I think your statement is right about demand for outpatient surgery. But for HCA, though, I will say a number of our service line initiatives that are intended to drive more acuity, more complexity and round out the offerings within our market, will be centered on certain service lines that have a lot of inpatient surgeries. For example, trauma, cardiovascular, oncology, just to name a few, have a very significant inpatient surgical component which is a very high-margin service line for the company and a very significant service line with respect to rounding out the depth of our service line offerings. So that's part of what's going on in our metrics as well.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thanks, Matt.
Operator: And we'll go next to Josh Raskin from Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the call. It seems like there's just been a lot going on in hospital land with spin-offs and real estate sales and other M&A. And it seems HCA is clearly focused on capital expenditures. You guys increased your guidance for CapEx last quarter. So I'm curious, could you help us understand just better what the projects are that you guys are investing in? You're spending more than all of your peers combined. And how do you estimate the returns on those capital expenditures?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sam, do you want to start with that one?
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: Well, I think the first thing I would say, the company has incredible cash flow that it has remarkable optionality with being able to use that. And when we think about capital expenditures and we think about the core growth agenda of the company, which is centered around organic growth within its existing markets, it creates a need for capital investment. And so from that standpoint, we have studied our growth trajectory, we've studied our capacity constraints and we've studied our opportunities, if you will, with our strategy, and we felt that the increase in capital expenditures was needed to really resource that particular component of our business in a very significant way. And you've seen us over the last five years incrementally increase our capital investments as we've come out of the LBO and into the public market as our volume improved, as our market share improved, as the economy has improved, and so that's been a driver for us. With respect to the components of that, as I've said on my comments and I've said in previous quarters' comments, inpatient capacity, outpatient capacity, technology that's needed for our nurses and physicians and then new facilities are really where we're spending our money, which makes sense. That's what we are when it comes to an organic growth-oriented company. So that's where the capital expenditures are going. Milton or Bill, I don't know if you want to speak to the other components of what's going in the industry.
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, let me just say that, first of all, I think you talked about some of the returns. We have I think a very sophisticated and effective process to evaluate our capital projects. And so we put them through a really solid process to evaluate the opportunities. And as a management team, the things Sam just talked about, before approving these projects as a team, with Bill and Sam and myself and others, we evaluate these projects. And I can tell you that we just approved a batch in the second quarter of about $550 million of expenditures that all of us went through. And personally, I think they're great investments. If you look at the returns, I think the average net present value return on that package of improvements is probably somewhere around 2 (40:14), so a very strong return opportunity. If you look at the company's return on invested capital, I don't have it as of June 30, but for the last 12 months ended March 15, our return on invested capital is 16.1%. I can say that the end of 2014 it was 15.2% and the end of 2013 it was 13.9%. So, we're seeing increasing returns on our invested capital. And if you know this company, we have been an organic growth company now for the last nine years basically. So when you think about the company going private in 2006, we had $4.5 billion roughly of EBITDA and, again, basically the same assets today, nine years later. And if we hit our guidance near the top end of the range of $7.85 billion, you can see the solid growth in earnings through that time. So I think our processes are effective. I think we have great investment opportunities. We're pursuing those. And I think our returns, especially the recent returns over the last few years, demonstrate that the process is working.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you, Josh.
Operator: We'll go next to Whit Mayo from Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, thanks. I'd just be curious if you could talk a little bit about the exchange volumes that you're seeing and maybe specifically anything notable in certain geographies, like Florida, that may be perhaps stronger than others. And we're seeing some of the rehab companies and anesthesiology providers talking about seeing these newly covered patients come through the delivery system now. So just wondering if there's any observation on service lines, access points. Is it still mostly outpatient? That'd be helpful.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right, Whit. Thank you. I'm going to let Bill take that and I don't know if Sam will have anything to add.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, let me start on that. A couple quick points on the observations. I don't really have any on service mix. But geographically, I can tell you Florida is our strongest exchange volume state. When we look in the pockets in Florida and I look at the year-over-year growth, Florida is our highest state in terms of growth of exchanges. That's both in South Florida as well as the west coast and spread along even the Panhandle. And we think as we see reports of enrollment in those states and I think the percentage of the population enrolled in Florida is the highest in the country, so with our footprint, I think it just leads that onto that. Texas is having great exchange and reform volume growth as well, probably just a hair below Florida. So our two largest states are showing the largest reform growth and we think you know that's positive on there. I will tell you our reform trends, as I alluded to briefly earlier, it's starting to level out in March, April, May and June. I look at the monthly numbers. So, we may have found our level for 2016 on there. But as I look at our two largest states, fortunately they're our two largest states with our highest year-over-year reform. I don't have any update at my fingertips on our mix and intensity. We mentioned last year that our reform business was carrying a little bit higher intensity. That's generally because of the lower OB volume is contained in that population than compared to kind of more commercial population as a whole. My belief is that's continuing on, so it's carrying a little bit more activity. So, I don't know, Sam, any more commentary on that? I think we're in a good position contract-wise and feel very good about our position from a network configuration perspective as well.
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: I think the general statement is this, Whit. The exchange business is very comparable to the commercial business, with the exception of obstetrics being slightly lower, as Bill indicated. Thus, the case mix is slightly greater. So that's the short story on the exchange business as compared to the commercial business.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right, Whit. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America.
Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin. Just coming back to the prior question around CapEx and your growth plans. Because even after subtracting CapEx, we're just trying to think about the uses for your free cash flow after you spend the money to grow internally. Any color you might give on how you going to allocate these funds? Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right, Joanna. Thank you. Milton, you want that one?
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, sure. So, it's really a capital allocation question. And we've been pretty consistent saying that with our free cash flow, we'd look first for acquisition opportunities. It's difficult to project when those will come and how they may or may not materialize. Following that, obviously first investing back in our markets, which we're doing. And then acquisition opportunities and then we've been a consistent buyer of our stock through share repurchase now for quite a while. As you heard me say in my comments, this year we have already spent $940 million on share repurchase from our February authorization. And, again, we have another just a little bit more than $1 billion remaining on our May 2015 authorization. So pretty consistent by using cash to employ back into the market to acquire our shares. And, again, quite a bit of powder available to us currently.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you. Next question?
Operator: We'll go next to Andrew Schenker from Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. So any impact worth highlighting related to the Florida LIP changes and the related Medicare provider rate increase in that state? And then kind of related to that, now that you expect to receive the Texas supplemental payment, should we think those payments are likely sustainable in future years, or will we be competing those revenues every year going forward? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right, Andrew. Thank you. Bill?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you. I'll try. Really no change in our Florida LIP program. Earlier in the year, the discussion about that program being reduced or eliminated and we've avoided that, so we think year-over-year we're solid in terms of the Florida LIP. Well, with the Texas Waiver, I think you may know that that Waiver period goes through 9/30 of 2016. We're in the fourth fiscal year of that and we've got one more year on that. And what happens beyond that Waiver program can't really predict. We know it's hugely important to the providers in the state, so we're hopeful there will be some renewal – reapplication of the state with CMS. And we'll see how that gets renewed and in what form after the current Waiver period expires. But, again, we're good through 9/30 of 2016 with that program.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: And, Andrew, I think you'd mentioned the CMS rates. I assume you mean the IPPS Final Rule that came in pretty much as expected. So flattish to moderately up if you look at our total book of business in Medicare for next year. All right. Next question?
Operator: We'll go to Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You guys have pretty consistently talked about the strength in the economy as being a major driver along with the Affordable Care Act. Some other companies have backed away from being able to differentiate between the benefit from the economy versus healthcare reform. Can you just walk us through your analysis and how you're comfortable that it still is a big driver from the economy and that it's not more healthcare reform?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right, Gary. Sam, Bill, which one of you want to start with that one?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Let me start and maybe add on. So, Gary, on the reform piece. I agree. I think over time, it will become more and more difficult to distinguish the amount that's truly the reform versus kind of the core business. Today we're still tracking what's going on within the health insurance exchanges and our ability to track that specific volume in that specific population and making some estimates of its impact to the company relative to a pre-reform era. I do believe as time goes by, and probably sometime in the next year (48:42), it's going to be more and more difficult to attribute the specific amount to reform versus other aspects, whether that be economy or our overall core strategies being executed. But for now, our reform is really being isolated for our health insurance exchange activity.
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: Yeah, I think, Gary, from my standpoint, we look at the HCA portfolio of markets as a routine to understand what's the job growth trends, what's the unemployment trends, what's the overall GDP, if you will, of each of HCA's markets. And what we see and what we understand is a very significant improvement in overall macroeconomic factors within each of our markets. It's hard for me to process that the exchange running, around 2% of our total business, versus the commercial, running around 28% to 30% of our total, that the exchange is driving the overall performance. It's not big enough yet. And so we believe San Jose, California; Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Miami, Florida; Nashville, Tennessee, these markets are uniquely growing, and we're seeing an overall commercial demand which is significantly outpacing the ability of the exchange component of our business to drive activity. And so those are some of the ways we triangulate into understanding how the economy is having an impact. And so that's how we judge it and we believe that to be the case. And we're optimistic that a number of these markets are going to continue to have very strong economic activities in the foreseeable future.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Gary, thank you. Next question?
Operator: We'll go next to Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Good morning. So you've talked about your contracts and what percentage is in place and so on by segments. Can you give us any color on trends and how that's looking up or down in terms of your negotiations with payers for commercial Medicaid and Medicare? And then any differences you might be seeing on Medicaid players versus commercial business, considering the rate increases that they're proposing are getting a lot of pushback for the exchange population from the commercial side? And then finally, on M&A, just all the M&A activity in the payer mix. Do you see your inorganic strategy moving away from maybe new market entry more to shoring up your share in existing markets?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. So we're going to do managed care contracting, what we're seeing there. And then we're going to step back and look at...
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: Yeah, Vic. This is Sam. There's absolutely no change in our managed care contracting trends as compared to the previous two years or so. Our inflationary adjustments in our commercial contracts are consistent with past trends in the 4% to 5% zone for most of our arrangements. On the governmental side of our contracting, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid products generally consistent with the states' and the Federal government's change in overall payment rates there. And then the non-pricing terms, as I mentioned in my comments, are fundamentally the same for the most part. There's a few pay-for-performance provisions that we've added here and there to round out our capabilities inside of those contracts, but those are not really inconsistent with past practices.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Bill, do you want to address the M&A activity?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, in the managed care space, yes. So, well, first, we need to see the outcome of the DOJ review from an anti-trust standpoint. That could very well affect certain market positions. And our analysis would be a market-by-market approach to understand the HCA impact. So, without having that information, we really can't address the HCA impact. Second, in many of our markets, pricing among the largest payers are in a fairly tight band today, which, of course, would minimize any short-term impacts. And then, a third, I'll remind you that with respect to HCA, our market position and market share, in most of our markets either we're number one or number two in share in most of our markets, puts us in a good position to be relevant to all the payers going forward. And so my concern more over the longer term is how does this consolidation or possible consolidation affect smaller providers or systems in markets that may only operate in one or two markets. And to your question about shoring up our share, we look to do that. We're trying to be opportunistic to do that. And the question I would have is could this consolidation be a catalyst for further provider consolidation. And that's yet to be known. We'll see how that plays out. But it could be a catalyst to give us more opportunity for consolidation in the provider space.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you, Ana. Another question?
Operator: And we'll go next to Dana Nentin from Deutsche Bank.
Dana Nentin - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking the call. Just going back to volumes, you saw some nice strength in areas like behavioral and rehab. Anything specific that's driving that strength, whether it be a function of some of your recent investments? Any color you could provide there.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Sam, do you want to take that one?
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: We have had over the past number of years a fairly aggressive effort in both of these service lines to develop capabilities in each of our markets. Both service lines are very complementary to core service lines within HCA. For example, behavioral health is very complementary to our emergency services line. Rehab is very complementary to our orthopedics and neurosciences. So we've been very aggressive over the past number of years in, number one, creating capacity and capability within these two service lines. And then the second thing we've been able to do is internalize the patient, if you will, inside the HCA network and keep them in the system when they needed those particular service lines. That has yielded a great deal of growth for us and we've had remarkable sustained growth in both service lines. We still believe we have opportunities in a number of our markets to make larger investments in each of these service lines by adding more capacity, taking advantage of the demand for these two service lines and then creating opportunities to capture more share of patients who hit our system and don't get these particular services within HCA network. So we're very bullish on both of these service lines.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Dana, thank you. And best I can tell, there's no one left in the queue. And I want to just thank everyone for being on the call. Appreciate it and look forward to seeing you all soon.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Hello and welcome to the HCA First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Charlotte. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call and including those of you listening to the webcast. With me here this morning, as usual, our Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO. Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call, we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc., excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims costs which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's fourth quarter earnings release. This morning's call is being recorded. A replay will be available later today. With that, let me turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on the call or the webcast. I trust most of you have had the opportunity to review our full quarterly earnings release issued this morning, which is consistent with the company's April 15th preview for the quarter. I will make a few remarks, then turn the call over to Sam and Bill to provide more detail on the quarter's results. We were extremely pleased with our first quarter performance. The quarter's performance was once again highlighted by strong volume trends, favorable payer mix and excellent expense management. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 19.3% to $1.961 billion compared to $1.644 billion in last year's first quarter. If you adjust the quarter's performance for electronic health record incentive income and share based compensation, adjusted EBITDA increased 20.6% over the prior year. Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, excluding gains on sales of facilities and legal claims cost, increased 53%. And diluted earnings per share increased 60.7% over the prior year's first quarter. The same-facility admissions increased 5.1% and adjusted admissions increased 6.8% over the prior year's first quarter. This is the largest year-over-year quarterly volume growth rate in the company's last 10 years. The growth was broad-based across markets and service lines. Our same-facility ER volumes remain robust, increasing 11.5% over the prior year, while surgical volumes also reflect solid growth over the prior year. With respect to health reform, as expected, we saw increasing levels of exchange volumes during the quarter. Bill will provide additional details in a moment. Due to the strength of the quarter and our revised outlook for the year, we have raised our guidance ranges for 2015. We believe revenues should now range between $39 billion to $40 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to range between $7.55 billion and $7.85 billion and earnings per share should range between $4.90 and $5.30 per share. There are a number of assumptions embedded in our guidance that are included in our release this morning and I would encourage you to review them. We had another strong cash flow quarter with cash flows from operating activities increasing to $1.018 billion compared to $443 million in last year's first quarter. As I stated in last quarter's earnings call, one of our key strengths is our ability to create shareholder value through capital deployment. We deployed approximately $446 million in capital spending back into our markets and also used approximately $366 million to repurchase approximately 5.2 million shares of our common stock. As of April 30, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 10.6 million shares of our stock, including 3.8 million shares from Bain Capital, and have expended approximately $781 million of the $1 billion authorization from February 2015. As noted in our release this morning, we announced that the board has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Also, as noted in our release this morning, we plan to increase our capital spend during the next three years by $500 million to $7.7 billion. The additional capital spend will allow us to expand our service capabilities to meet increasing market demand. Sam will discuss this in more detail in a moment. We continue to advance our patient safety, quality of care, and patient experience objectives. Our focus is to continue to strengthen our delivery system capabilities and I believe we are strategically positioning the company to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. And finally, I would like to congratulate Dr. Jonathan Perlin, our President of Clinical Services and our CMO, as he assumes the Chairman role of the American Hospital Association. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey. Good morning, everybody. As Milton indicated, we had a strong quarter driven by strong volume growth and excellent expense management. So I'll give you some more detail on our performance and then discuss our health reform trends. As we reported, in the first quarter, same-facility admissions increased 5.1% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 6.8%. We will provide more color on the drivers of this volume in a moment, but I'll give you some trends by payer class. During the first quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 5.9% and 6.8% respectively. This does include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 14.3% on a same-facility basis and now represent 32.2% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 10.6% and 13.9% respectively in the quarter, fairly consistent with our recent trends. We continue to see strength in our six expansion states but also have seen strength in our non-expansion states as well, and I'll provide some additional comments on Medicaid in my health reform comments. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions declined 12.5% in the quarter while equivalent admissions increased 5.1%. These represent 6.3% of our total admissions compared to 7.6% last year and continue to trend favorably for the company. Managed care and other, including exchange admissions, increased 5.8%, and equivalent admissions increased 7.7% on a same-facility basis in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 11.5% in the quarter compared with prior year and same-facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 18.6% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 22% last year. Intensity of service or acuity moderately increased in the quarter, with our same-facility case mix increasing 26% compared to the prior year period. Same-facility surgeries increased 2% in the quarter, with same-facility inpatient surgeries increasing 3% and outpatient surgeries increasing 1.4% from the prior year. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 1.6% in the quarter. This was softer than our recent trends. Currency translation rates for our international division and Texas Waiver revenues impacted our reported number. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission for our U.S. domestic operations, excluding Waiver revenues, increased 2.1% over the prior year. Our outpatient revenue as a percent of total was 37.7% versus 36.9% in the prior year and that also diluted NRAA (09:41) slightly. Same-facility managed care and other, including exchanges, revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.3% in the quarter. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $175 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care discounts totaled $887 million, a decline of $37 million from the prior period, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.507 billion, an increase of $212 million over the prior-year period. Now, turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was excellent and we were able to leverage strong volumes. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission declined 0.7% compared to last year's first quarter, and this led to an improvement of 170 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margins in the quarter to 20.3%. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenues improved by 40 basis points to 45.5% compared to 45.9% in last year's first quarter. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 0.4% in the quarter on a same-facility basis, leveraging our strong volume in the quarter. Same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission declined 0.6% for the first quarter compared to the prior-year period, an improvement of 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue from last year's first quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives. Other operating expenses improved 90 basis points from last year's first quarter to 17.7% of revenues. We did recognize $19 million in electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $30 million last year, and that's consistent with our expectations. As previously mentioned, our as-reported adjusted EBITDA margins increased 170 basis points, and adjusting for EHR incentive income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 190 basis points over prior year for the quarter. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another extremely strong quarter with cash flow from operations increasing to $1.018 billion at the end of the quarter. And at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.587 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. Debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.8 times at March 31, 2015, compared to 3.96 at the end of 2014 and 4.35 at the end of the first quarter of 2014. So, let me spend a minute talking about health reform. Health reform activity was strong for the quarter. In the first quarter, we saw approximately 9,880 exchange admissions as compared to the 1,600 we saw in the first quarter of last year. You may recall, we saw about 7,700 exchange admissions in the fourth quarter of 2014, or a 28% increase quarter-to-quarter. And we believe this is largely due to the new enrollment. We saw approximately 37,000 exchange ER visits in the first quarter, compared with the 4,000 in the first quarter of 2014 and the 26,000 in the fourth quarter of 2014. We have history on about 50% of our quarter one exchange volume and based on our look back at previous coverage, we estimate about 40% of need admissions were uninsured to prior to health reform. Given this is the second year of reform, we are also tracking what the coverage was in 2014. Based on the exchange patients where we have 2014 experience, 36% were previously covered under a HIX product, 39% were covered by another insurance product, and 25% were uninsured in 2014. We will continue to evaluate these metrics throughout the year. In our six Medicaid expansion states, our trends in the first quarter were consistent with what we saw in the second half of 2014. In these states, uninsured admissions were down 59% compared to the first quarter of 2014, and Medicaid admissions were up 31% in the expansion states. For reference, in our non-expansion states, same-store uninsured admissions were down 8.2% and Medicaid admissions were up 7.2%. When we roll all of the components of health reform that we can track, we currently estimate health reform contributed just over 5% of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and in line with our expectations for the quarter. So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: Good morning. As mentioned earlier, volume growth was strong in the quarter, and it continued to accelerate compared to the previous four quarters in 2014. As I stated in my fourth quarter comments, we believe this performance reflects improving macroeconomic trends in many of our markets. And we also believe it reflects market share gains which have been driven by a combination of solid execution of our growth agenda by our operating teams and capital spending that has been invested both to increase access to our networks and to add operational capacity. There were no unusual factors that contributed to the quarter's accelerated growth. Admissions with a flu-related diagnosis were up, but the overall effect on volume growth is minimal. Growth in volume was once again broad-based across most of the company's markets, and it was also broad-based across the various service lines of our business. On a year-over-year basis, for the quarter, all of our 14 domestic divisions had growth in admissions, growth in adjusted admissions, and growth in emergency room visits. All but one division had growth in both managed care and exchange admissions and adjusted admissions. For the company, managed care and exchange ER visits grew by 13.4%. All divisions had growth in emergency room visits for these two payer classes. All but two divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries. Surgical admissions accounted for 26.6% of total admissions for the quarter, down slightly from 27.2% in the first quarter of the previous year. This quarter is the 8th straight quarter where we have had growth in inpatient surgeries. Nine divisions had growth in hospital-based outpatient surgeries, which were up 1.7% for the company. Hospital-based outpatient surgical volumes have grown in seven out of the last eight quarters. Our ambulatory surgery division also had growth in the quarter. Surgeries in this division were up almost 1%. Most service lines had some level of surgical growth with notable growth in orthopedic, cardiovascular and neurosurgery. Outpatient revenue for the company grew by almost 12% in the quarter and represented 37.7% of total patient revenues. Other categories of our inpatient business were strong also. Deliveries for the quarter were up 3.1% with 10 divisions showing growth. Managed care and exchange delivery were up almost 8%, 11 divisions had growth in these payer classes. Neonatal admissions grew 7.3%, behavioral health admissions were up 11.7%, rehab admissions were up 14.1%, and average length of stay grew by 1%, reflecting the higher case mix and acuity of our admissions. Market share trends for the company for the 12-month period ended September 2014 were generally consistent with past trends. Market share grew by 13 basis points to above 24%, approximately 65% of our markets increased share across most service lines. Of particular note was the rebound in overall inpatient demand which increased in the third quarter across HCA markets by slightly over 2%. Commercial demand was even more notable with an increase of over 6%. We believe demand in both the fourth quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 were equally strong. We will report on these quarters when the data is available. HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda that we believe is driving sustainable market share gains and overall results. We continue to invest in our local markets at significant levels but occupancy and utilization levels have grown to the point where we need to increase our capital spending to maintain the capacity for future growth. Bed occupancy levels have grown to over 70% of operating beds and in many fast-growing markets, they are running at even higher levels. ER bed utilization, even with the significant investments we have made over the past few years to add capacity in this service line, has grown by 7% and is now over 85%. The anticipated increase in capital spending that we announced will provide over the next few years more capital in our markets to add inpatient bed capacity, increase emergency room capacity, enhance service line offering and add necessary equipment for our nurses and surgeons. In certain markets, capital spending will be deployed for new hospitals and new outpatient facilities. Many of our projects have a lead time that requires us to get started soon to address these capacity constraints. And finally, managed care and exchange contracting continue to progress as planned. The company is currently contracted for almost 95% of its revenue for 2015, 65% of its revenue for 2016 and 45% of its revenue for 2017. The pricing terms and the non-pricing terms of these contracts are generally consistent with the previous year's terms. With that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Sam, thank you. Charlotte, if you could come back on and poll for questions, and I would ask that everyone limit your questions to one, so we can give everybody an opportunity.
Operator: Again, we would ask that you limit yourself to one question. We'll have our first question from Matthew Borsch, Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Richard Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Hi. Good morning. In light of the strength of results, I want to ask, if you can touch on it, what you saw over the course of the quarter, if there's any granularity you can give us on the three months as they developed, perhaps any impact that you saw from the weather, although I know that was pretty northeast-centric? And then anything at all you can say about what you've seen in April?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Matt, thank you. Sam Hazen. I can tell you right now we don't touch on April. We stay with the quarter, but Sam will take the rest.
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: You have to, in any particular quarter, consider the business day complement within each of the months. And I want to say we had a headwind in January and a tailwind in March with respect to the calendar as far as business days are concerned. And so, that influenced each of the months accordingly. Nonetheless, in each of the three months, we had pretty solid volume growth, if I remember correctly, across most of our metrics, March was clearly the best month for the quarter because of the size of the month, number of business days that we had, and so forth. And I think from that standpoint, we had a pretty steady performance throughout the quarter, with a little bit of acceleration in the month of March given the calendar benefit. As it pertains to weather, we did have weather in a number of our markets in Texas, and also in Tennessee, in Kansas City. But those tended to wash out, I think, reasonably well in the quarter and really did not have any kind of material impact on the volumes.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Matt, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Frank Morgan, RBC Capital Markets.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes. Clearly, very strong results. So, I'm just curious, with the strength in the volume and the growth in the economy, are you seeing any wage pressure, are you planning on that in light of all the growth that you're seeing? And then, with this capital deployment you're putting in place, accelerating that, and with the buyback, would that necessarily preclude you from the M&A market? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sam, you want to address wage and Bill will take the other one?
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: We have had in certain markets, where the economy has historically been a little bit better, seen some level of wage pressure. We've been able to deal with that on the fly, if you will. And we've adjusted certain compensation programs and so forth to give ourselves capacity to address some of those challenges. We are benefiting over the last few years from a relatively low inflationary environment and we are considering that in evaluating what we can do to prepare ourselves for possibly some level of inflation over time. I do think it will happen from one market to the other. It won't happen in one big step across the whole organization. Having said that, in the first quarter, we did have a higher level of contract labor utilization than we typically have but we attributed most of that to the increased levels of volume that we saw in the quarter and we had to staff that at some level with additional contract head count. We think that will normalize as the volumes normalize over the course of the year. But from that standpoint, Frank, we are not considering any short-term pressures with wages that are going to create a problem for us.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: And Milton?
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. On the capital deployment strategy, Frank, we've been saying now really for a number of years that we have a diversified strategy with respect to capital deployment. We always try to be optimistic with how we deploy capital. So this quarter makes a really good example, where we're stepping up our capital spend, as Sam described, in many of our markets to meet anticipated demand in those markets. At the same time, another $1 billion share repurchase authorization. And again, we will continue to look for acquisitions that fit our profile. Our balance sheet today, the leverage ratio is the lowest point it's been since we entered the LBO in the fourth quarter of 2006. Our cash flow is as strong as it's been, I think, in the history of the company. So, we've gained financial flexibility. And so we will continue to deploy capital in a way that we think will maximize shareholder value and shareholder returns, at the same time with a view towards continuing to invest in our business for the long term. And in the markets that we're in, of course, we're seeing a lot of good opportunities and improving macroeconomic conditions as well and all that contributes in our change in outlook relative to how much capital we plan to deploy in these markets. But we don't think that any of these steps relative to share repurchase nor the additional capital spend in any way reducing our flexibility to be acquisitive if we have the opportunity.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thank you, Frank.
Operator: We'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe, Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. I just wanted to come back to that point. So you mentioned debt to EBITDA down, I think, 3.8 times. I think historically, you've talked about being comfortable in kind of the 4 times and 4.5 times range. So I guess at this point, how should we think about your appetite to lever up a bit, maybe talk a little bit about the M&A pipeline? And then just along those lines, there seems to be more interest in JVs or partnerships out there among hospitals. Is this something that you all are interested in or maybe has that been a hurdle as to why maybe we haven't seen larger system sales to this point? Thanks.
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: This is Milt. Let me touch a little bit of that, then maybe Bill Rutherford want to comment on it as well. Ralph, we're actively looking for the right acquisition opportunities for HCA. We do have a profile that we're looking for and potentially moving into new markets, for example, or expanding in our existing markets. That's been more, of course, what we've been doing recent years is more what we call a tuck-in acquisition. Those are the ones that – again, we like those as well, but they tend to be smaller as far as relative to HCA as a total company. But we're always looking for right opportunities. We potentially have transactions in some phase of development. Many times though, obviously in the last year, they haven't moved to closure. But we're continuing to look. We think that we have a lot to offer to a strategic player out there relative to bringing our size and scale to the marketplace and some of our operating capabilities as well. So we will continue to be interested. As I've said many times over the recent years, it's just very hard to predict when those opportunities will come. They tend to come and go at a pace that's hard for us necessarily to manage. We would also be interested in joint venture opportunities. When we meet with a strategic player about a potential transaction, it doesn't always have to be 100% acquisition. We would consider partnerships. As you know, we operate several significant partnerships in our portfolio in some major markets. So we have a lot of experience with success in doing that, and we would continue to have that as an option if, in fact, we had a willing partner who wanted to move in that direction.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Bill, you want to...
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Speaking of balance sheet, Ralph, as we've said, our leverage target range is 3.5 times to 4.5 times. Given our size, a full turn's almost $7.5 billion. So that gives us a lot of flexibility within that range, plus considering we're sitting here at 3.8 times right now. I think if you look at opportunities in the marketplace, if the right opportunities came along, I think we've got plenty of flexibility to operate within that range to lever up if the right opportunity came up. Our acquisition pipeline still is active in the outpatient area and kind of the other services that we remain active on, growing those outpatients. You've seen us do acquisitions of a smaller size even last year. So I think our balance sheet is really strong, gives us a lot of flexibility. And given our stated ranges and given our size, I think we've got plenty of capital capacity to execute on a variety of market opportunities.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you, Ralph.
Operator: We'll go next to Darren Lehrich, Deutsche Bank.
Joshua Kalenderian - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. This is Josh Kalenderian in for Darren. Thanks for taking the question.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sure.
Joshua Kalenderian - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just wanted to ask you guys what the company's contingency plans are in the event that the Supreme Court sides with King. And then related to that, hoping you can give us the approximate exposure on a run rate basis to the ACA benefit from exchanges, and how much of that is in federal marketplace? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you. Milt, you want to lead off just on the SCOTUS comment?
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean, one thing about our operating strategies that we're investing in, these strategies are effective either in an exchange product, a reform environment, or what I would call our core environment. They're effective either way. So, I don't see any significant change in our operating strategy at all, if the Supreme Court decision rules against the government. Now, as a contingency plan, we always look at opportunities to react to the marketplace. But quite frankly, again, our main operating strategy is we're going to be effective either in a reform environment or not. Now, I think that with respect to the Washington aspect, and we're very active. And Vic, of course, is head of our government relations, we're very active in Washington. We would work very, very hard in Washington to lobby for some sort of other program if in fact – or some sort of transition plan. So, a number of things we'd be doing in Washington as a contingency plan. But as you know, I'm not going to tell you that we can certainly predict the outcome of what's going to happen in Washington. But we certainly would be very active as we are today in terms of getting our voice heard by the decision makers in Washington.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: And I guess I'd add to that – this is Vic – that almost weekly, when I go to D.C., I see more and more concern about individuals losing these subsidies in these states. And whether you're talking to Democrats or the Republicans, I think there's a strong belief we can't lose these subsidies. And the other thing that you're seeing is that they're looking at a longer period of time to try to keep the subsidies in place. We don't know what the Supreme Court would rule if it goes the other way. But I think the belief is by most members of Congress is that this has to be extended for some length of time to allow those people to keep those subsidies.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I'll just add on just a couple other points and just remind you that our exchange admissions are basically 2% of total HCA admissions. If I go by just state enrollment trends, about 75% to 80% of our states are in federally-run exchanges with 20% to 25% in state-run exchanges, in response to your question. And then as we indicated in my comments, we're estimating that reform contributed about 5% of adjusted EBITDA for the company in the first quarter, go north of that for the balance of the year as it progresses. So I think, back to Milton's point, the core business and core HCA operation still remains very strong.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Darren (sic) [Josh] (32:58), thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Andrew Schenker, Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Just following up on the comment you mentioned some of the strength earlier. Would you be able to perhaps give some additional anecdotal indications of how your economically sensitive volumes are progressing? I mean, you noted orthopedics earlier and trends in obstetrics, et cetera, and then any geographic variations like Texas that are worth calling out relative to the rest of the portfolio.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Andrew, thank you. Sam, you want to.
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: Yeah. It's very hard to sit here and attribute a certain component of volume to one thing or the other, but using commercial demand from our market share analysis as the proxy for overall economic health, and the best metric for that is the third quarter of 2014 where commercial demand across all of HCA's 42 markets was up 6%. That was fairly broad-based. We have some markets that are better than that and some markets that are slightly worse than that. So when I look at the first quarter and I look at our commercial volumes across the various service lines and compare it to the third quarter, they're very similar. So it would suggest similar commercial demand growth overall, and we'll get that data sometime in the next four months to five months. I'll be able to report that out and verify that conclusion. But specific to Texas, Texas in overall metrics across the eight markets where we do business in Texas were generally consistent with the rest of the company when it comes to top line activity and when it comes to payer mix activity. So there weren't any noticeable headwinds in Texas. We did pay particular attention to Houston, given the energy economy there. And again, HCA had pretty strong performance from a top line standpoint in the market, Houston by itself. I look at obstetric demand which was up by, what'd I say, double digits. Commercial emergency room demand, very strong. And then, even in our physician practices, we saw a slight improvement in our payer mix, again, I think, reflecting some of the volume and some of the dynamics within our marketplace.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you. Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick, Mizuho.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Thank you very much. I'm going to ask a question that I'm not sure you're going to be able to answer, but when I look at your margin, I mean, I get the scale, I get the argument of the density and the clustering and all the things that you do right. So I understand that. But your margins are whole lot better than everyone else's. So, A, congratulations, good job; B, please keep it up; and, C, how do you keep it up? Is it through the pricing or are there things that you're able to do and accomplish that others can't that you can attribute some portion of this? I mean, you have to have looked at it at some point I would imagine because it is noticeable, it is striking and, of course, it's what drives that superlative cash flow that we talk about. Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sheryl, thank you for the question. Sam is really smiling over here. He obviously is doing a great job but there are a lot of things he can talk about.
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: Well, I think, Sheryl, when I look at the company, I can't speak to the dynamics particularly inside of all the other companies and what their margins are because we have some variation within our portfolio of hospitals as you can imagine. I will say it's fairly tight when it comes to high performance, low performance and then clusterings around the mean. The thing I think that we believe is driving margin production inside of HCA, you mentioned scale. We do believe leveraging the scale and continuing to find ways to leverage our scale both on making our business better with respect to quality, efficiency, patient experience, all those kind of things are very helpful in the discussion here and then finding ways, again, to take out administrative cost. We're able to do that. The other thing that I think is important to the company from a margin standpoint is we do have a growing complexity of services that we offer and, typically speaking, more complicated service offerings will generate higher margins. And if you put that on fixed cost base like our hospitals have, the operating leverage that comes from that is very powerful. So we've been very intentional over the past four years or five years to add more complexity to our facility offering. And in most of our markets make sure we can offer pretty much any service to any patient that needs care. So if they hit an HCA system as an outpatient or in a physician practice somewhere, how do we keep that patient in the system by having a full complement of services. That has helped us on the margin. The third thing is we have been able to maintain our competitive position which has allowed us to get reasonable reimbursement increases from our payers and that's helpful, obviously, from a margin standpoint. And then the fourth thing I would mention is that we have been intentional about our efforts to grow our commercial market share and put ourselves in a potion to generate margin from that particular segment. And I think gain, coupling our service line offerings, our capital deployment, our outreach strategy and focus it specifically on the commercial segment has allowed us to generate healthy margins for the company. And so, those are some of the things that we focus on, those are some of the things that we're fairly intentional with as it relates to resource allocations, tactical approaches in certain markets and so forth. And then the last thing, and I think this is a powerful and tangible asset for HCA and one that we're getting better at each and every year, is leveraging the learnings that we see across the various marketplaces. If we see a great physician strategy or we see a great outreach strategy or program strategy or quality initiative, whatever the case may be, bottling that up, finding a way to get it to the marketplace quickly is something we're getting better at. And I think we will continue to gain ground over the years, and that will also help us with our margin initiatives as well.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sam, thanks. Milt, do you want to add something?
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think Sam described it very well. I was going to just reinforce his last comment around our ability to really identify best practices and then to move those across the company. I think we're – as Sam said, we're more effective at doing that today than we've ever been in terms of getting these best practices implemented across different markets. And then I'll just also just have to say to our teams, across our divisions and our groups and Sam, it's the ability to execute it. We have a team that really understands execution and accountability. And right now, there's just a lot of momentum in the organization. And I think we're seeing our teams really execute on our agenda across the board, and that's helping drive the top line and, of course, contributing to the margin expansion as well.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Sheryl, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin, Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Question on the broad topic of maybe value-based reimbursement or risk taking and maybe even as far as provider, sponsors, health plans. Seems like there's been a lot more movement in maybe the non-for-profit world around some of that. I'm curious what sort of exposure HCA has with some of those arrangements and broadly what your thoughts are on the company's ability or even desire to take risk or share risk or in some way get paid on value as opposed to fee-for-service.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Milt, do want to lead off on that?
R. Milton Johnson - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Let me maybe take the last part of that question, then go back to the value equation, but we're – as a company, we're not looking to move and to take risk. We don't see that right now in the intermediate term as something that we need to do. Now, do we have markets where we are taking a certain amount of risk that's not material to the company. Sure. We have pilots going on. We have experiments going on across all different revenue models from the (41:49) payments from shared savings program, pay for performance programs. We have in Tampa a physician group with full risk of about 35,000 lives. So we have some things going on that allow us to see the marketplace, but in the aggregate, those are not material to HCA's operations at this point in time and with also a sense of urgency that we need to move that way. I know some in the industry may see that differently, but that's where we see it. Now, with respect to value, and we talk a lot in our organization about healthcare and the value that we need to bring to our markets. And we see right now, our value as being turned by including, number one, patient safety, patient quality, patient experience, access points, so that it makes our system accessible, easy to get into, easy to access from a patient standpoint, from a physician standpoint, from the standpoint of bringing capability that Sam talked about in terms of being able to take care of any patient's needs from basic care to some of the more complex acute care that they may need in the marketplace. So if we can deliver high-quality, and we're efficient as an operator and have the right access points, we see all those factors contributing to real value to patients and values to employers, value to payers. And that's what we're focused on. That's what we're executing today. That's our agenda. And then, we'll keep an eye on the marketplace and watch how this risk revenue model plays out, but we're looking at 42 different markets across HCA, all markets are a little bit different, but we're certainly not feeling any pressure to have to move our revenue to a risk model here anytime soon.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Josh, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin. Thanks for taking the question here. So you raised the guidance with Q1, obviously a very strong quarter, but can you just maybe flesh out the biggest variance in terms of why you're so confident early in the year to raise it? And then on the guidance, where you stand in terms of the same-store adjusted admission, 2% to 3% you gave before and pricing of 2 to 4 (44:10), you gave before as well? Thank you.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thank you very much. Bill, you want that one?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I'll do it. Obviously, we finished 2014 very strong and we carried a lot of momentum into the first quarter of 2015. You don't always know how that momentum is going to carry across calendars, but given our really strong performance in the first quarter, felt really it was necessary to update our guidance. The majority of the updated guidance came from the strong performance in the first quarter but clearly our raise of almost $200 million of adjusted EBITDA factored in continuing momentum in the balance of the year. And so, we think, we really feel very confident in that revised guidance. It's largely continuing carrying the momentum we saw in the fourth quarter of 2014 into first quarter. We're not revising really kind of our volume rate of guidance that we gave in February during our call. At this point in time, I think we still need some more quarters to get into detail. But given the strength of the first quarter performance, we thought it was necessary to up our guidance. And, in fact, if we hadn't and you implied the guidance for the balance of the year, it would have been relatively flattish year-over-year. So, we feel very confident with the momentum we've got right now, and that really is what led to the revised guidance in the release.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Joanna, Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Ana Gupte, Leerink Partners.
Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the commentary you had about strong Medicare admissions and managed Medicare admissions. Is that likely just because there's more people in the system because of the aging boomers, or are you seeing something else in terms of inpatient authorizations?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think it's both. As Sam mentioned in some of his comments, it's really hard to dissect kind of individual contributions. I think the overall company momentum contributed to that. Clearly, I think increasing enrollment in Medicare, more in the Medicare Advantage as well we're benefiting from. But kind of the other kind of marketplace dynamics are in the Medicare payer class as well as in our other payer classes. So, I think it's really a combination of a variety of factors that really go along with the volume drivers of our other core business.
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: Yeah. Bill, let me just add. We believe that Medicare business in general is not as economically dependent obviously as the commercial book. So the movement in Medicare is not going to be as pronounced as what we've seen on the commercial side of the equation. And so the aging of the baby boomers is going to continue to create opportunities for Medicare volume growth, and then gains in market share and program development and so forth are going to hopefully add additional volume opportunities for the company.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Ana, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Question for Sam, so as we think about this capital plan, are there any specific areas where you're expanding or is this just a general addition of inpatient beds and ER beds in hospitals. Or this more of a targeted approach to specific growth areas within your hospitals? Thanks.
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: Well, it's general in the sense that it will go to what produces revenue for the company which are the beds in the ERs and the surgical equipment, as you said. I'd like to think we're heavily targeted in how we deploy capital and we're looking at markets. Specifically, we're looking at facilities within those markets and then we're adding to the capability of those institutions. Where necessary, we're bringing new institutions into the marketplace. For example, over the past 18 months, 24 months, we've added 4 new hospitals. We've added numerous outpatient facilities to round out the convenience of our network for our patients so that it's easy for them to access an HCA system. So it's going to be the same approach, just more of it because we have those kind of opportunities, we believe, in the marketplace to continue the programs, the effort and hopefully the sustainable growth that we've seen over the past few years.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thank you, Brian.
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: And let me just add one thing there, we do have certain markets, as I mentioned in my call, Vic, where there are more pressing demand needs and more pressing capital needs. So the company will be focused on a handful of markets here or there. We haven't finalized that plan specifically yet. But we do see some opportunities specific to certain markets where there could be a little bit of an enhanced spend in those markets to really take advantage of the situation.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice, UBS.
A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC: Hello, everybody. I might just ask you about the supplemental programs in Florida and Texas. Obviously, there's an aspect of the Texas Medicaid Waiver that you're not currently booking. Can you just comment on whether there's been anything behind the scenes there, discussions and whether you're actually getting the money, just not booking it? And then more broadly, there's certainly been discussions about the back and forth between CMS in Florida about the low income pool and about the Texas General Medicaid Waiver. Can you give us your perspective there, and sort of size the exposure and what you think is going to happen, if anything?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thanks, A.J. Bill will take it.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, A.J., let me try to cover some of those. First, let me address kind of Texas Waiver. As we indicated at the end of last year, we plan on reducing our revenue recognition to the Texas Waiver. In the first quarter, we recognized about $77 million of Waiver revenues in Texas, compared to about $112 million in the first quarter of 2014. So, it was down $35 million which is really consistent with our expectations and I think the items we talked about last year. We understand CMS inquiry in Texas is continuing. We don't have anything new to report on there, and so we're still keeping our eye on it. Clearly, a lot of discussion with various programs, whether they come under the form of provider tax, UPL, low income pool, kind of we understand that all of those are really approved and funded with CMS, either as a state plan amendment or a 115 Waiver program. And there's differentiating characteristics, as you know. The state plan amendments are not time limited. And generally, the state does not have to be asked to be to reapproved for those unless it modifies it's Medicaid program. And then we got the 1115 Waiver programs which are time limited and states must ask for re-approval. And those are the issues in both Texas and Florida. The Florida has had a lot of publication on there. We receive about $75 million annually from the Florida (51:17) funding. We think it's really kind of early to talk about what might happen with these programs. With Texas, we know we have a Waiver that goes through 9/30/2016. All of these programs are extremely important for the safety net of the hospitals in those states and communities. So we'll continue to keep our eye on what's going on between CMS and so forth. You think if there's programs at risk, it's in those 115 Waivers in those non-expansion states. And really that's Texas and Florida for us. Kansas and Tennessee are others, those are really the smaller programs on there. So we're going to keep our eye on it, and see where that flows, but we don't have anything new to report on Texas. And our revenue recognition's really in line with what we talked about last year until we get some more clarity on that.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thank you, A.J.
Operator: We'll go next to Gary Lieberman, Wells Fargo.
Ryan K. Halsted - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning. This is Ryan Halsted on for Gary. Just wanted to ask a question about the commercial contracting. As you're doing your contracts for 2016 and 2017, I'm just curious if you're seeing a move towards more narrowing of the networks? It seemed like 2015 was kind of a shift to a narrow network for you guys versus 2014 so I'm just curious if you're seeing or if you're contemplating potentially going further with narrowing the networks in the out years?
Samuel N. Hazen - President-Operations: Yeah. This is Sam. The short answer to the contracting provisions for 2016 and 2017 around narrow networks is they haven't really changed materially at all. On our core commercial contracts, there's hardly any changes with respect to that. Within the exchange component of our contracting, as we indicated at the end of 2014 in our first call for the fourth quarter of 2014, we have increased the number of exchange contracts for the company, I think, about 35% to 37%. And some of those did include a narrow network component, others didn't. So, in global terms, there's not a lot of change at this particular point, and it looks as if our 2015, 2016 and 2017 contracting cycle is not going to have a lot of change. And we don't think it's in the best interest of the company to push that particular strategy in most situations. So I don't anticipate during the next 24-month to 30-month cycle any material changes.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right. Thanks, Ryan. We've got time for one more question.
Operator: That will come from John Ransom, Raymond James.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Can you hear me?
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Yes, we sure can, John.
John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Just on the exchanges, you didn't contract with 40% or so of the plans. Did the out-of-network contribution from some of those members, has that been a material driver for you?
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I want to say it was – hey, John. This is Bill. I'm not sure about 40%. We were really well represented, I think, with all but a couple of markets in first year reform. We did see some out of network in year one. As Sam mentioned, I think the increase in exchange contracts that we saw in year two addressed some of those. So, I won't say it was material. We were seeing some out-of-network business in the reform in the exchange business in year one and year two. In several of those markets, we've gotten into the contracts in there. So, I won't classify it as it was a material driver for us, but it was a factor.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: All right.
William B. Rutherford - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, John.
Victor L. Campbell - Senior Vice President: Thank everyone, for being on the call. Mark Kimbrough will be here all day to take any questions you have, and I thank you very much.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Vic Campbell, Senior Vice President, Please go ahead, sir.
Victor Campbell: Chenelle, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I would like to welcome everyone here today on the call, as well as those of you who are listening to the webcast. With me here this morning are Chairman and CEO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Rutherford, our CFO. Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Several of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. On this morning's call we may reference measures such as adjusted EBITDA and net income of attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. excluding losses or gains on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A table providing supplemental information on adjusted EBITDA and reconciling to net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. to adjusted EBITDA is included in the company's fourth quarter earnings release. As you heard, the call is being recorded and a replay will be made available later today. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.
Milton Johnson: Thank you, Vic, and good morning to everyone for joining us on the call or on the webcast. I hope each of you has had the chance to review the release issued this morning, which is fairly consistent with the company's preview for the fourth quarter issued on January 9. I'll discuss the year and few other items, and turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide additional details on the quarter, health reform and 2015 guidance. We are extremely pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2014. The fourth quarter performance was highlighted by strong volume metrics, favorable payer mix and excellent cost management. As a result, we produced revenue growth of 9.1%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 14.1% and diluted EPS growth of 29.3% over the prior year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share, excluding the gains and losses on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, increased 44.6% over the prior year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, revenues totaled $36.9 billion compared to $34.2 billion last year, an increase of 8% compared to $6.574 billion in 2013. Diluted earnings per share increased to $4.16 compared to $3.37 per share last year, an increase of 23.4%. EPS per diluted share, excluding gains and losses on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt and legal claims cost, increased to $4.70 compared to $3.41 per share last year, an increase of 37.8%. Our results clearly exceeded our internal expectations for 2014. One of our key strength is our ability to create shareholder value through capital deployment. For the full year 2014, we generated $4.45 billion of cash flows from operating activities, up 20.9% over 2013. We reported approximately $2.2 billion in capital spending in our existing markets in 2014, and we acquired three hospitals and a number of non-hospital healthcare related entities for approximately $770 million. These investments revolve in their access points and enhance our service capabilities in our markets. Additionally, we repurchased 28.6 million shares of our stock for $1.75 billion in 2014, and today we announce the authorization of a new 1 billion share repurchase program. With respect to our commitment to quality of care and patient safety, during the fourth quarter 85% of the company hospitals reporting core measure performance data were recognized as top performance by The Joint Commission. Recognizing that we will increasingly be measured and reimbursed based on the quality and value of our services, improvement in patient outcome and patient service will be our top priority in 2015. As a part of this emphasis, we recently hired our first Chief Patient Experience Officer, who will be responsible for servicing best practices that have been developed across 88 hospitals, as well as other healthcare providers to ensure our patients have the best hospital experience. Our efforts to improve quality and service are not only important to our patients, but also to all of our caregivers and the employees that want to align the top quality organizations and pay our employers for receiving greater value. We believe our operating strategies are highly effective and resource appropriately for 2015. In addition to our robust clinical agenda, we will continue to develop local market networks for convenience and access, quality and deep service capabilities and position alignment. A great example of improving convenience and access is our recently announced acquisition of CareNow, which operates 24 urgent care centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, with approximately 850,000 patient visits per year. Now, moving to health reform. We are pleased with our 2014 growth from healthcare reform, which largely resulted from our approach to exchange contracting. For 2015, we remain disciplined with our pricing strategy and we have broadened our network participation in many of our large markets. For example, we have increased our health exchange contracts by 37% over 2014. Bill will provide additional information on health reform in just a few minutes. And in closing, I must congratulate Sam Hazen on his appointment to HCA's Chief Operating Officer. As many of you know, Sam has served in a number of executive roles during his 32-year career at HCA, most recently as President of Operations. I have worked closely with Sam for many years, and I appreciate his commitment to achieving ever-improving operational performance that supports the best clinical outcomes for our patients. As HCA continues to evolve its strategies in areas of clinical quality and physician engagement, a number of roles in the company have increased in significance and responsibilities. As a result, we have promoted four HCA executives to HCA's senior management team. These promotions not only are well-deserved, but I believe they enhanced our ability to achieve ever-increasing higher clinical performance and meet the many objectives we have, as an industry-leading organization. And finally, we are excited by the inclusion of HCA in S&P 500 indices, starting from January 26. We are happy to be part of this group. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William Rutherford: Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everybody. I will cover some additional information relating the fourth quarter results, then I'll turn the call over to Sam for an update on operations, then I'll come back and discuss health reform detail and finish with the discussions surrounding our 2015 earnings guidance. Once again, we were extremely pleased with the quarter's results. Fourth quarter volume trends were some of the best we've experienced in a number of years. This coupled with good payer mix and service mix and excellent expense management, combined to drive the quarter's and the year's strong performance. For the quarter adjusted EBITDA, as reported, increased 14.1% to $1.956 billion from $1.714 billion last year. We reported an improvement of 90 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter to 20.3%. During the fourth quarter we recorded a $68 million increase in Medicaid revenues related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program, a reverse reduction made in the third quarter. As a reminder, we made an adjustment in third quarter to reduce Medicaid revenues due to some uncertainty caused by the CMS inquiry of the Texas Medicaid Program and the payment deferral that was issued. During the fourth quarter the company received approximately $161 million related to our outstanding receivables in CMS looking the deferral they had previously issued. So these events gave us really the long assurance regarding recognized Medicaid revenues associated with the Texas Medicaid fiscal year ending September 30, 2014. And thus, the $68 million adjustment was made in the fourth quarter. However, we understand, CMS continues to inquire in certain aspects of the program on a go-forward basis. As a result, the company reduced its Medicaid revenues by approximately $35 million in the fourth quarter and we expect to reduce Medicaid revenues by approximately $70 million in 2015, well prepared to what we recognized during the course of 2014. We will continue to monitor developments relating to this program and update you on any material changes. Adjusting for the impacts of these items as well as EHR income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA grew 14.4% over the prior year for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, our same facility admissions increased 5% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 5.6%. Sam will provide more color on the composition of this volume in a moment. During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 6.1% and 5.8%, respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 11.7% on same facility basis and represent 31% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 9.1% and 12.7% respectively in the quarter, consistent with the trends we experienced in the third quarter. We continue to see strength in our five expansion states, but also have seen growth in our non-expansion states as well. I will provide additional comments on Medicaid in my health reform remarks. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions declined 8.8% in the quarter, while equivalent admissions declined 4.6%. These represent 7.2% of our total admissions compared to 8.3% last year and has continued to turn favorable for the company. Managed care and other, which includes exchange admissions increased 5.3% and equivalent admissions increased 5.6% on a same-facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 10.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility, self-pay and charity ER visits represent a 19.7% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 23.2% last year. Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter, with our same-facility case mix increasing 0.7% comparing to the prior year period. Same-facility surgical volumes increased 0.6% in the quarter, with same-facility inpatient surgeries increasing 2.4% and outpatient surgeries declining 0.3% from the prior year. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.5% in the quarter. Same-facility managed care and other, which includes exchanges, revenue per equivalent admission increased 3% in the quarter. Consistent with our third quarter results, case mix increased 1.9% compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $238 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care discounts totaled $897 million, a decline of $18 million from the prior-year period, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.39 billion, an increase of $256 million over the prior year. Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was very good as we were able to leverage strong volumes and higher intensity of services. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 0.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue improved by 50 basis points to 44.4% compared to 44.9% in last year's fourth quarter. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.8% in the quarter on a same-facility basis leveraging our strong volume in the quarter. Supply expense per equivalent admission was flat for the fourth quarter compared to the prior-year period and improved 50 basis points as a percent of revenue from last year's fourth quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives. Other operating expenses improved 10 basis points from last year's fourth quarter to 18.5% of revenues. We recognized $28 million in electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $50 million last year. Consistent with our expectations, we incurred approximately $16 million in electronic health expenses in the quarter compared to $28 million last year. As previously mentioned our as reported adjusted EBITDA margins increased 90 basis points over the prior year. Adjusting for Texas Waiver items, high tech income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 100 basis points over prior year for the quarter. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another extremely strong quarter, with cash flow from operations increasing to $1.627 billion, 33% above last year. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.1 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. For full year 2014, cash flow from operations was $4.45 billion and free cash flows were just over $1.8 billion. So that concludes my remarks on 2014. I'd like to turn the call over to Sam to give some additional detail for the quarter, and I'll come back and discuss health reform and our 2015 guidance.
Samuel Hazen: Good morning. As mentioned earlier, volume growth accelerated in the fourth quarter as compared to the previous three quarters of the year. We believe this performance reflects a combination of solid execution of our growth agenda, our operating teams, improving macroeconomic trends in many of our markets, and capital spending that has been invested both to increase access to our networks and to add operational capacity. There were some additional factors that contributed to the quarter's accelerating growth. First, we had a return to normal seasonality trend. Typically, fourth quarter volumes trends are over the third quarter by approximately 1.5%. In 2013, this did not happen, which created a favorable comparison for 2014. Secondly, admissions with the flu-related diagnosis were up 77%, which drove approximately 40 basis points of our overall growth. And finally, the anniversary of the CMS 2-Midnight Rule occurred in this quarter. These factors overlap somewhat, but I wanted to highlight them. Growth in volume was broad-based across most of the company's market and it was also broad-based across the various service lines of our business. On a year-over-year basis, for the quarter, all of our 14 domestic divisions had growth in admissions, both in adjusted admissions and growth in emergency room visits. All but one of our divisions had growth in managed care and exchange admissions and adjusted admissions. All divisions had growth in emergency room visits for these payer classes. All of our divisions had growth in inpatient surgeries and 10 had growth in hospital-based outpatient surgeries. Most of them had some level of surgical growth with notable growth in orthopedics, vascular and general surgery services. Our Ambulatory Surgery Division had continued softness in the quarter. Surgeries were down 2.6%. Deliveries for the quarter were up 3.7%, with 10 divisions showing growth. Managed care and exchange deliveries were up almost 11%. All divisions had growth in these payer classes. Other categories of our business were strong also. Neonatal admissions grew 9.5%. Behavioral health admissions were up 9%. Rehab admissions were up 9.7%. And finally, average length of stay grew about 0.9%, reflecting the higher case mix and acuity of our admissions. Market share trends for the company for the 12 month period ended June 30, 2014, are generally consistent with past trends. Market share grew by 10 basis points to slightly above 24%, with approximately 60% of our markets increasing share across most of the service line categories. Of particular note is the rebound in overall inpatient demand, which increased in the second quarter across HCA's markets by slightly over 1%. Commercial demand was even more notable, with an increase of 3.5%. Demand in the prior two quarters of this 12 month period was down. HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda that we believe is driving results. We continue to invest in it at appropriate levels. In 2015, we will be increasing our capital expenditures to around $2.4 billion. This increase will provide more capital in our markets to add inpatient bed capacity, increase emergency room capacity and add equipment for our nurses and sergeants. In certain markets, the capital spending will be deployed through new hospitals and new outpatient facilities. In addition to the increasing capital spending, we are making investments in other aspects of our business and will require additional operating expenses in 2015. We believe these investments are strategic and will have a positive impact for the company in the future. The three months prominent investments are in the following areas. First, the company is implementing a new human resource model, we call it oneHR, that will leverage the company's scale and consolidate certain administrative functions, such as recruiting and training. Once implemented, we believe this effort will enhance our workforce and help our facilities deliver better care more efficiently. The second area is related to our information systems. The company is making additional investments for information system that we believe will provide a better user experience for our physicians. Additionally, we expect these investments will create more robust clinical data that we can leverage across our business to improve quality, increase efficiencies and drive growth. And finally, the company is making an investment to implement the new ICD-10 coding requirements, which go into effect later this year. These operational initiatives plus a few smaller ones represent approximately $100 million in additional cost in 2015. With that, let me turn the call back to Bill.
William Rutherford: Thanks, Sam. So now, let me move into a discussion about health reform and our 2015 guidance. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we saw just over 7,700 exchange admissions and about 26,000 exchange ER visits. This is about equal to our third quarter exchange volumes and fell in line with our expectations that exchange growth will level out in the second half of the year. Our trends in Medicaid expansion states continued into the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, Medicaid admissions were up 51% and uninsured admissions were down 65% in expansion states. For full year 2014, Medicaid admissions and expansion states increased 40% and uninsured admissions were down 58%. In non-expansion states, Medicaid admissions increased 3.3% and uninsured admissions declined 1.6% over prior-year's fourth quarter. For the year, Medicaid admissions increased 2.4% and uninsured admissions declined 3.4% in our non-expansion states. With only five states expanding Medicaid bill, the vast majority of reform benefit is still coming from the exchange activity. The percentage of our exchange volume that was previously uninsured came down a bit in the fourth quarter. And now year-to-date, based on our look-back, we estimate about 42% of exchange volume were newly insured for 2014. When we rollup all aspects in reform, we estimate health reform contributed about 4.5% of adjusted EBITDA growth for us in 2014, and that's when you compare it to our 2013 adjusted EBITDA. As we think about modeling, the 2015 reform benefit demonstrate there remain several variables that impact our assumptions and guidance and including final enrollment, the percentage of newly insured for the new enrolled lives, utilization trends and the impact of changing networks. With all of these variables, we are currently estimating our reform benefit to increase approximately 60% to 70% from 2014 levels and represents 2% to 3% of incremental EBITDA growth over 2014, as reported EBITDA. As a result, we estimate about 6% to 7% of our 2015 adjusted EBITDA will be related to the benefits of health reform. Remember, these are benefits from increased coverage of the uninsured and are not being offset for these purposes by the [indiscernible] reimbursement cuts to our annual CMS updates that we all experienced. Our assumption on reform, in essence, starts with our current run rate and inflates for a growth factor that's principally keen on projected increases in total enrollment in exchanges, keeping our current experience for the assumption of newly insured about the same as 2014 and impact during a ramp up of utilization, similar to what we experienced this year. There were a few other variables impacting our reform estimate, but we look at our growth principally by annualizing our current run rate and increasing for new enrollment activity. There still remain some unknown variables that may impact the reform benefit. So for now, this is our guidance going into 2015. And consistent with our practices in 2014, our plan is to continue to update you on our experience, giving material changes in our thinking in conjunction with reporting our quarterly results. Looking ahead for this year and our 2015 guidance. Highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimated our 2015 consolidated revenue should range from $38.5 billion to $39.5 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $7.35 billion and $7.65 billion. So let me walk you through how we think about our guidance. First, as a management team, we view 2014, on all accounts as an outstanding year, one of our best years ever. We were benefited not only by strong organic growth in health reform, but also a couple of non-recurring adjustments, and we highlighted these items within our release this morning. Between the Texas waiver adjustments and RAC settlements alone, we recognized about $300 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2014 that we are not projecting to reoccur in 2015. In addition, as anticipated, at around four year vesting schedule, our non-cash share-based compensation expense is projected to increase about $60 million in 2015. Lastly is the continued step-down of our HITECH incentive income of about $80 million. We are also indicating a decline of HITECH expenses and approximately $70 million of these costs remain in the company to continue to support electronic health vendors and other ongoing automation efforts. Going forward, these costs are no longer being classified as HITECH expenses, but they remain in the system. So when you adjust for these items, the $300 million of non-recurring adjustments, share-based comp and HITECH income declines. The midpoint of our guidance reflects about 7.2% growth over 2014, which includes the 2% to 3% reform benefit, leading our core business growth between 4.5% and 5%. Within our revenue estimates, we estimate equivalent admission growth to range between 2% and 3% for the year and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range between 2% to 4% for 2015. We anticipate our Medicare revenues per equivalent admissions to reflect the composite growth rate of about 1%, factoring in market basket changes and offer reductions as well as some anticipated intensity increases. Medicaid revenues per equivalent admissions are estimated being mostly flat year-over-year, excluding the declines of Texas Medicaid waiver revenues. And managed and commercial revenues per equivalent admissions are estimated to grow between 4% and 5%. Operating expenses are anticipated to continue to benefit from the continued low inflationary environment, and we are estimating large improvements to range between 20 basis points and 50 basis points on a normalized basis. We anticipate capital spending to increase to $2.4 billion in 2015. We estimate depreciation and amortization to be just under $1.9 billion and interest expense to be about $1.7 billion. Our effective tax rate is expected to be about 38%. And lastly, our average shares are projected to be approximately 442 million share and earnings per share guidance for 2015 is between $4.55 and $4.95. So that concludes my remarks. I'll turn the call over to Vic for some Q&A.
Victor Campbell: Bill, thank you. So now if you could jump back on and poll for questions. And we would encourage each of you to limit your questions to just one, because we have quite a number of folks on the line today and we'll give everybody a chance.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Josh Raskin: So I appreciate you guys delineating the EBITDA growth. And I guess if I look at it now that sort of core growth, that you guys are talking about, the 4.5% to 5%, that actually screen toward the higher-end of, I guess, your 3% to 5% long-term organic growth. So is that just economic recovery? Does that include some of the outpatient growth and acquisitions that you guys are seeing? It didn't sound like the volume growth is necessarily can be way above historical. So I'm just curious, why you guys are more comfortable at that higher-end of the organic growth rate?
Milton Johnson: I'll start up with that and then Bill and Sam maybe want to add some comments. Yes, it is at the higher-end of our 3% to 5% growth that we have been stating for a number of years now, which we expect certain years to obviously do a little bit better, maybe other years a little bit less, but we think that's a reasonable zone. And we did guide to the high-end of that range this year. Now, I think it's reflective of our marketplace, as you know, the capital that we're spending, we've increased our capital spend over the last couple of years. Again, we're seeing a macroeconomic improvement in many of our markets. We've talked about that over the last several months. We're seeing our volume in that 2% to 3% range that we're guiding, coming off of year we were 2.9% this year for the year. So we think all those things, the acquisitions we've made and some of the tuck-in acquisitions, the acquisition of CareNow, all those things providing us to I think come in a core growth near the top or at the top of our 3% to 5% expectation.
Operator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Justin Lake: So I wanted to dig in on the reform guidance for a minute. Specifically, can you walk us through the run rate coming out of the fourth quarter? And maybe also can you give us a ballpark estimate for the reform benefits in Q1 through Q3, just so we understand the run rate versus the new growth? And then I had one quick numbers question.
Victor Campbell: Bill, that's all yours.
William Rutherford: Let me try to walk you through it and do the best I can on it and I'll try to lay out some detail on the commentary. As I look at reform, we said it contributed about 4.5% of our growth in 2014. That clearly ramps in the second half of the year, leveled out to Q3 and Q4. So a little bit higher towards the backend of that number you can estimate. As we think about watching our reform, 2014 we saw a ramp up of volume, low in Q1, ramps through our Q2, and really leveled out in Q3 and Q4. So a simple way we look at our estimate is, first, by annualizing our Q4 run rate, and that utilization makes up about half of our increase alone. And then we're estimating the new enrollment numbers on top of that. And I know we're all keeping an eye on this. We're roughly keying off HHS total enrollment projection of around 10 million, up from 7 million or so in 2014. That's obviously nationally, so we did try to make some assumptions and distract enrollments trends in our markets. So keying off this, we potentially might see a 40% to 50% increase in total enrollment. We don't expect to see that kind of volume increase day one, so we're back to our assumption on volume ramping through Q1 and Q2, and with this we might see an expected increase, let's say, 30% to 35% on top of our Q4 run rate. So, yes, a large portion of that growth will be weighted towards Q1 and Q2, and then you might see that 30% or so growth overall run rates for the Q3 and Q4. So year-on-year growth is probably a little bit between the first quarter and second quarter. And half of it is coming from or half of the growth is coming from the utilization effect and the other half coming from our assumption around increased enrollment.
Victor Campbell: Justin you had one numbers question, you wanted to ask.
Justin Lake: If you could give us cash flow from operations and minority interest numbers, that will be great.
William Rutherford: I think cash flow from ops would be in a range of between $4 billion and $4.5 billion. And I don't have minority interest handy [indiscernible]. I'll get to you, Justin.
Operator: And we'll go next to A. J. Rice with UBS.
A. J. Rice: I guess I'll just ask about Texas Medicaid waiver and your assumptions there. So you recognized, say, about $70 million in 2014, but it sound like for the last two quarters of the year you were getting about $34 million to $35 million a quarter. I guess what is the run rate that you would say if you get these approvals that you'd see it in '15? And it sounds like there is some indication that you're going to get something, you just haven't pinned down exactly what the amount is. Can you just confirm that and give us some flavor more or detail, as to what you're actually looking to see?
Milton Johnson: I know there are a lot of moving parts to this, so let me try to walk you through and simplify as best I can. In the third quarter, due to inquiry and payment deferral, we reduced the Medicaid revenues and our related expected receivables that we have previously recorded, due to that uncertainty. The Medicaid program is on a 10-month fiscal year, so our adjustments we booked in the third quarter really related to the September 30, 2014, yearend in what we have previously recorded. As I mentioned, based on the activity we saw on the fourth quarter, the $161 million payment [indiscernible] related to the '14 fiscal year gave us confidence in restoring our estimate for that program here. So what we're really talking about is reducing our revenue recognition for the program years in 2015 and potentially even 2016, depending on how the inquiry unfolds. And so the reduced revenue is about $35 million in the fourth quarter and the effective reduce in our revenue recognition year-over-year is about $70 million from 2015. So how I would think about it is, majority of that reduction that we're recognizing between '15 and '14 is because of some uncertainty around the inquiry on a go-forward basis. We hope to have some insight and maybe even clarity on the extent of that inquiry going forward and will adjust that as necessary, but in essence what we're doing is reducing our revenue curve going forward in light of some of those ongoing inquiries going forward. So I think $70 million is the number used year-over-year, and if that returns favorably, then we'll re-examine revenue that we should record going through the '15 year.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin Fischbeck: Just want to follow up on the exchange benefit. I guess the math that you laid out makes some sense. Although, I think that Bill could have made it a little bit faster. It just feels conservative. Where does the 37% increase of exchange contracts fit into that analysis? I would think that should be additive. Or is there some offset on pricing or something else that we should be thinking about?
Milton Johnson: It is. And Kevin, as I tried to mentioned, there is a lot of variables that go into it. We try to simplify, just taking our run rate up by a level, and clearly we're factoring it in kind of new contracts, potentially new access. There is also other factors that we talked about in the past, some potential current yield declines or payment declines, as you participate in some of those networks to slight degree, some in fact are Medicaid expansions. So we've factored all of those variables into our estimate. We're trying to just characterize by the run rate plus enrollment. But it is being adjusted for both, the increased network participation and offset a little bit by some yield differentials in payments for the previously insured commercial product as compared to exchange product.
Operator: We'll go next to Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker: Just following up once again on the exchange math here. I do appreciate commentary on the 40% to 50% increase in enrollment, but last couple of quarters you guys talked about your expectations to increase your yield and converting your uninsured over to exchange rates and expenses in '14. Maybe if you could just touch upon how your experience is with those populations progress? And any expectations, the uninsured may deviate in a positive way for you guys from versus maybe national expectations?
Milton Johnson: Andrew, we key off really what our current experience is and as we talked through before what we do is look back at exchange patients level we've seen this year, look back how we've previously seen them and what was their status when we saw them. And that's what we're coming up with our estimate of about 42% on a yearly basis of the patients we saw in exchanges who are newly insured. We're clearly keeping tack of various reports that are out there about year or two. And one of the key variables will be -- is the new large in year two really be similar on a percentage newly insured, can they potentially be greater than the numbers in year one. And we know that's a variable. But our assumption right now is based on the best experience we have, which is what we're actually seeing. As a corollary, maybe related to your question, we are making outreach efforts within our communities to help people explore gaining access to coverage. And as we did talk about I think on our last quarter's call, we stepped up our efforts this year as compared to what we were doing last year. We've partnered with several national agencies. We've made a lot of outbound efforts in terms of e-mail, letters, even personal contact, helping people register within community events, and helping people explore access to coverage and made it available to them either through expanded Medicaid or health insurance changes. I characterize those efforts as much better than we've had in year one. We sometimes lose visibility in how much of those actually yielded in enrollment, but the patients that were new were very, very impressed that we were able to have some traction on the communities and for our previously uninsured patients that we serve. So we probably know this is a variable keeping track of. If it turns out national enrollment is more favorable than that, then our experienced kind of yields that. Then I would hope our advantage is greater, but right now we're going on the assumption base than based on our actual experience.
Operator: And we'll go next to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich: My question is in the context of Secretary Burwell announcing last week on HHS', obviously setting some I guess medium-term goals on alternative payment models. And I was just hoping you could update us on where HCA is in terms of time, quality to payments and if there is a way to quantify now how much your revenue is contracted and any kind of alternative payment models beyond just the street fee-for service?
Samuel Hazen: Milton, you want to take that?
Milton Johnson: Of course, Darren, we've been dealing with some paper performance elements in our Medicare reimbursement. Now, for the last few years, we do well with that. Of course, that's a small percentage of the overall Medicare revenue. In our managed care contracts, many of our managed care have paper performance and those contracts typically impacts the amount of the annual increase, it maybe a 0.5% or a certain amount of the increased subject to achieving certain performance metrics. And again, we perform well with those metrics. When I talk about the bigger picture, the value in healthcare, and I mentioned this in my opening comments, we realize that with changes in healthcare, increasing consumers in the healthcare that we need to provide greater quality in service and value. And so if you look at our agenda around quality, our agenda around patient service, our ability to deliver care efficiently, our facilities, the investments we're making in technology, all these things, clinical excellence, all these things I think are reflective of an organization that's focused on improving the outcomes and service to our patients and therefore providing more value for the healthcare dollar. So I feel very comfortable that we're making the right investments to be able to operate effectively in an environment where it's, say, more value-based, based on quality outcomes and delivering value to the patients or to the payers or to the employers. Today not a lot of our revenue quite frankly is subject to that. Again, it's implemental in certain contracts. But we are preparing the organization to be able to perform in that environment, if we see the marketplace change. Number one, it's good business, it's what we should be focused on, quality and service to the patients, as I said is our number one priority and it will continue to be in the foreseeable future.
Operator: And we'll go next to Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman: I guess maybe could you talk about your view on additional states expanding Medicaid. Is any of that factored into your guidance? And I guess which states you're most optimistic about potentially participating what the benefit might be?
Milton Johnson: In terms of factoring into guidance, we are only including the states that have expanded Medicaid. So we're not making the guess on where others are. We do have a small physician in Indiana and it appears that Indiana is moving forward, so that's very good moves. Here in Tennessee you're probably all aware that a special session of the legislature began last night. Governor Haslam is working very, very hard and many are working with him to try to help our state legislatures understand how important this is to the state of Tennessee and benefits that would accrue to many across states. So we're hopeful and reasonably optimistically hope that that can get passed here early, but we have not put any of that into our numbers. We'll obviously continue to watch other states and be supportive where we can be.
Gary Lieberman: Any view on Florida specifically of what might happen there?
Milton Johnson: Probably your view is good as mine. There are some who support it and some who don't and we don't necessarily think it happened this year, but your guess again would be as good as mine.
Operator: Now we'll go to next to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe: Capital deployment back to shareholders in the form of repurchase and even dividend at times has certainly been strong. I guess the question is where do you sit with M&A? Do you see longer assets emerging, is valuation perhaps centering deals? And I guess what's the outlook and pipeline for maybe larger system consolidation?
Milton Johnson: Well, as I have said for the last several years, we're interested in the opportunity to grow through acquisitions have the right market dynamics, and recourse with the right pricing discipline. Quite frankly we haven't seen a lot of opportunities, what I call needle-moving opportunities. We've had a few, and in many cases, the seller decided not to pursue other transactions. So we remain hopeful that we'll see some good opportunities. But as I've said many times in the past if we don't have the opportunities to grow through acquisitions, we'll continue to invest in our existing markets and see our capital spend increase for 2015, up to about $2.4 billion. We have opportunities to grow organically. We've been doing that in recent years. We'll continue to do that. We're fortunate to have markets that are growing. We're seeing some improvement in demand for services. And again, with our growth strategies, we feel confident we can continue to have solid organic growth as expressed in our guidance for this year. Also, with our strong cash flows, as Bill mentioned, we do have the opportunity to return cash to shareholders on a regular basis. Most recently, we've been doing that with share repurchases the $1.75 billion that we accomplished in '14, and this morning announcing another $1 billion share repurchase. So we've had a very diverse capital deployment strategy since coming back into the public market in 2011. And we will continue to do that. We try to continue to take advantage of the opportunities that the market presents. And use our balance sheet, the good position we have on our balance sheet appropriately to increase shareholder value.
William Rutherford: If I could add one thing to that, we have been fairly active in outpatient acquisitions and other type of facility acquisitions that complement our networks within each of our markets and we'll continue to be opportunistic in that particular area, because it's very accretive to the local market and it creates better platform for our provider systems locally. And no, that opportunities are not material in and of themselves, but they do add value over time and create different relationships with patients and different relationships with physicians.
Operator: Now, we'll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan: Most of mine have been answered, but I guess I've got one here for Bill going back to the guidance. I know there are a couple of things that I kind of picked up on, that might be upside. But from your perspective, where do you see the biggest wiggle room, the biggest drivers to either getting the high end of your range or maybe even exceeding it?
William Rutherford: I'll try not to walk into something. I think we tried to walkthrough really some of the moving parts that we have prepared for '15 and '14. And that puts us, as I think mentioned before, at high end of our traditional range of 3% to 5%, perhaps a little bit lower than what we posted in the past year or so. So reform, clearly, I would tell you there is still remain variables on reform. It turned out better throughout 2014, and we anticipate it going into 2014, but there's so many variables that go into it. It's our operational trends, volumes and rates as well as how some of these kind of moving parts unfold on us. And I think there is more probably right now has some of the most variability to it.
Operator: Now, we'll go next to Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut: Just a follow-up on Frank's question and to your answer to that one, Bill. At your Medicaid expansion state ER visits for the uninsured, what's the trend that you're seeing so far? Are you still seeing improvements throughout, that where we ended in Q4?
William Rutherford: Yes. So in our expansion states, it's leveled off. We saw the majority of the benefit in the third quarter in the state. The uninsured declines in our expansion states are still in that 60% level, so we're kind of leveled off at that. So I'd say they have found their level right now. I think that's contributed significantly to the company's overall uninsured trends. And I'm not so sure what we'll see in a year two in those expansion states in terms of the year-over-year growth. I think there is probably still some more room for uninsured to gain access to coverage in year two in those expansion states. Clearly it won't be as dramatic as we experienced this year. So I think for the most part, it probably found its level. We seem to be in the fourth quarter about where we were in third quarter. So we might see some incremental benefit going into the year with more uninsured gain couch in those expansion states, but its still 60% to 65% decline that we saw in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Now, we'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Chris Rigg: This is kind of a follow-up to the last question, but historically the industry has talked about frequent flayers and more population representing kind of a disproportionally high level of the bad debt. I guess, particularly in the Medicaid expansion states, but also among those that you presume to be newly covered or under commercial subsidiaries, have you seen any behavioral changes from the population? Have they come into the ER less or anything notable to highlight would be great.
William Rutherford: The remaining uninsured, I can't say I've seen anything different in their behavior. We have identified that cliff, and our outbound efforts this year were trying to help people, in that situation understand access and availability that walk in for coverage. But I don't think we've seen any change in their behavior.
Samuel Hazen: Let me add one thing to that. On the Medicaid side, I think that's entirely the case. We haven't really seen a significant change in Medicaid activity and behavior. So the emergency room heavily, they struggle to get access to physicians in some markets. So that dynamic still exists. On the uninsured, who have gained access to commercial insurance products, we have seen less utilization of the emergency room and more availability to other facility opportunities or physician opportunities. And that's been slight, but significant enough for us to notice that when they do get commercial insurance, there is different ability to access care through physician office or possibly through urgent care centers and the like and not through the emergency room. So that has been noticeable. Is it material yet? No. Could it possible develop over time? And again, that's part of the reason we are looking at other alternative facility acquisitions and development in urgent care and so forth, so that we're prepared for that dynamic, if in fact it does occur.
Operator: Now, we'll go next to Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.
Ana Gupte: So just could you give a little bit more color on the volumes trends and what you're assuming in your guidance for 2015? Specifically, on the HCA, with the existing enrollment that you have, what types of volume assumptions have you made with regard to the surgeries and procedures and so on depending on the health risk you've seen. Any color on the economy as far as what you're assuming on either changing trends or unemployment? And then finally on, any shifts you might have seen on Ebola and the flu that I think you 40 bps, what is the assumption being made for the '15 guidance?
William Rutherford: Let me try to address the first part. As we mentioned, our overall volume guidance is 2% to 3% of equivalent admission growth for the year. You asked specifically around health reform volume contribution to that, we alluded to kind of our health reform build to 50% to 60% year-over-year, a little bit north of that. That is reflecting equalization of the growth, principally in the Q1 and Q2 time, and then anticipating on an average basis about 30% to 35% growth in enrollment. So that has helped fueling some of our increased volume growth for the company. Sam, I'll let you comment on the economic.
Samuel Hazen: I think if you do short circuit, the volume assumptions at the company had build into its 2015 play and its 2015 guidance. It's really on the particular point. First is that we do think that the market play is going to revert back to sort of normal demand growth. In some of that is the macroeconomic picture, but some of it is normalized activity with respective flus and so forth as we've seen from one quarter to the other. So that's going to generate we think, somewhat between the half of point of growth in overall demand. And then if you look at our market share trends, over the past 24 to 36 months, we've tended to pick up 20 basis points to 25 basis points in market share maybe as a good metric over time. So when you put that together, it puts us in the range of our volume guidance. We have numerous initiatives that should drive growth into marketplace, and Milton touched on them, it revolves around creating sufficient access points to our networks, so that patients can find it convenient to enter into an HCA network. So we have significant investments in additional outpatient access points. In 2015, that will hit the marketplace. Additionally, we are making sure that our networks within each of our markets have a comprehensive array of service line, so that they can take care of a patient, if needed within any particular service line somewhere within our network. Again, we're adding capability there with different kind of service line offering there both deeper income statement and broader in others. And then the third piece is related to our physician strategy, when we're working with our physicians to add physicians to our medical staff or to create better alignment through different technologies and different relationships and so forth, and that we believe is rounding out the growth strategy. So if you underpin that with more capital going into the market, we think those are the basic elements that will continue to support market share gains and industry-leading growth.
Victor Campbell: We're closing in on the hour, so one last question.
Operator: And we'll go next to Gary Taylor with Citi.
Gary Taylor: I didn't hear you say much about Texas and maybe I missed that earlier, but just maybe some thoughts on anything you've seen in the quarter. The Texas economy, obviously, energy dependent to some degree, and then how that factored in 2015 if you're anticipating to see some weaker results in Texas?
Samuel Hazen: In short, we have evaluated the effects of the energy economy, if you will, and what implications it presents for us in Texas. In Texas, economy we believe is significantly more diversified today than it was in years past. Having said that, the Houston market, in particular, is the market that's most susceptible we believe to the energy dynamics are up, but in the face of all of that we've done the diversification in Houston as well. And our overall believe is in 2015, we're not going to have a dramatic impact on trends in Texas. And so we have not factored in any kind of significant trend change in any of our markets with respect to our assumptions in those particular cities. Again, Houston is the most impacted we believe and we think our strategies are very solid there, and we'll be able endure some modest change in their economy. And that has been one of the better economies across HCA, when you look market activity and economic growth and so forth. Houston, that's obviously the most significant economy by itself. And you do see that reducing, but the effect of that is not going to be material. End of Q&A
Milton Johnson: Thank you everyone and we look forward to hearing from you. And Mark will be here all day, if you're willing to chat. Thank you and have a great week
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell: Thank you, Martina, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call and those of who are listening to our webcast as well. With me here this morning is our President and CEO, Milton Johnson; CFO and Executive Vice President, Bill Rutherford; and Sam Hazen, President of Operations. And I might add in case any of you missed our announcement yesterday afternoon, Milton Johnson has been elected by the HCA board to become Chairman of the Board effective December 31, 2014. He'll obviously continue as CEO. Congrats to Milt. Before I turn the call over to him, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay will be made available later today. With that, let me turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson: Thank you, Vic, and good morning. We hope each of you had an opportunity to review our third quarter 2014 earnings release issued this morning. I'll cover a few highlights then turn the call over to Bill and Sam to provide more details on the quarter. We previewed our third quarter results on October 15, and our results today are consistent with that preview. We are very pleased with the performance in the quarter, which includes strong volume metrics, favorable service and payer mix, combined with effective cost management. As you will hear later in the call, these improving metrics are broad-based across our markets. As a result and as part of our October 15 preview, we raised our 2014 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $7.25 billion to $7.35 billion and EPS to $4.40 to $4.60 per diluted share. Health care exchange admissions continued to increase in the quarter. We also saw significant reductions in our uninsured volumes during the quarter. Consistent with our second quarter, we believe approximately 2/3 of our adjusted EBITDA growth can be attributed to our core operations and approximately 1/3 to health care reform. Bill will provide more detail on health care reform in a moment. However, as noted in our revised guidance, we now believe health care reform will comprise approximately 4% of our 2014 adjusted EBITDA growth, up from 2% to 3% in our previous guidance. Last quarter, we disclosed that we finalized exchange contracts in all of our Texas markets with UnitedHealthcare. Today, we're announcing that we have also finalized exchange contracts with United for all of our major Florida markets. We believe we are positioned well as the exchange marketplace continues to evolve. Now moving to our recent credit market transactions. On October 17, the company completed a $2 billion bond offering consisting of $1.4 billion of 5 1/4% senior secured notes due 2025 and $600 million of 4 1/4% senior secured notes due in 2019. Net proceeds will be used to redeem the company's existing $1.4 billion 7 1/4% senior secured notes due in 2020 and to pay related fees and for other corporate purposes. The redeemed notes are the last of the company's outstanding bonds with more extensive high-yield so-called [ph] operating covenants. The redemption will reduce the company's borrowing costs and provide increased financial flexibility. We also expect to complete an amendment to our asset-based revolving credit agreement facility later this week, upsizing our borrowing capacity from $2.5 billion to at least $3 billion to take advantage of the growth in our eligible accounts receivable balance. Cash flow continues to trend positive. In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities totaled $1.128 billion, up approximately 25% from the prior year. Free cash flow was $431 million in the quarter. Without giving the effect to the October bond offering and related redemption, total debt at the end of the quarter was $28.47 billion, and the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.96x compared to 4.32x at December 31, 2013. This morning, we also announced the authorization of a $1 billion share repurchase program. We expect the repurchases to be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, utilizing our strong cash flow coupled with existing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. On the development front, I'm pleased to announce the acquisition of CareNow. CareNow is one of the largest independent providers of urgent care, family practice and occupational health in the Dallas-Fort Worth market. In 2013, their clinics served approximately 9% of the Dallas-Fort Worth population. We expect to complete the transaction sometime during the fourth quarter. The company also announced in September the acquisition of PatientKeeper, a company that provides an innovative technology platform that focuses on the physicians' online experience. Working in conjunction with the underlying EHR systems and other physician-based technologies, PatientKeeper provides a more efficient and elegant workflow. We view both of these acquisitions to be highly strategic for the company. Finally, let me address the topic that's been on everyone's minds for the last several weeks, Ebola. We began tracking Ebola before its expansion to the United States caused a national emergency. We donated $1 million to the CDC Foundation to aid with relief in West Africa, and we are pursuing additional donations of beds and other supplies. In a few moments, Sam Hazen will provide comments on HCA's Ebola preparation, processes and activities. I believe the past few weeks have provided U.S. hospitals with an opportunity to improve preparedness planning for an Ebola threat. At HCA, our teams continue to assess and improve our processes to ensure high levels of safety for our patients and all members of the HCA team. I would like to commend everyone at HCA who is working diligently to test, assess and reinforce the standards in place throughout our organization. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill.
William B. Rutherford: Hey, thank you, Milton, and good morning, everyone. I will cover some additional information concerning the third quarter results, health reform detail and then finish with our revised 2014 guidance. As Milton stated earlier, we were extremely pleased with the quarter's results. Third quarter volume trends were some of the best we've experienced since 2012. This, coupled with improving payer mix and service mix, excellent expense management, all combined to drive the quarter's strong performance. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 14% to $1.828 billion from $1.603 billion last year. We reported an improvement of 80 basis points in adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter to 19.8%. This quarter included 2 items of note, which had the net effect of increasing revenues during the quarter by $26 million. We recorded $94 million as the estimated settlement amount for claims denied by RAC audits, which remain in the appeals process. As you know, CMS has offered an administrative agreement to providers willing to withdraw their pending appeals in exchange for a timely partial payment of 68% of the claim amount subject to certain adjustments. The company believes this is a fair settlement and has issued claims submissions for virtually all of our qualifying hospitals. The amount in question had been written off at the time of the takeback by CMS, so our adjustment is recognized in the settlement of these previously written-off amounts. In the third quarter, we also recorded a $68 million reduction to Medicaid revenues related to the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program. As detailed in our release this morning, CMS issued a notice to release certain local government hospital affiliations it believes may be inconsistent with the waiver. As a result, they are now deferring the federal portion of the Medicaid payments associated with these affiliations while it completes its review. Based upon our historical experience, the company had been accruing amounts associated with the waiver program. Prior to our adjustment in the quarter, we had approximately $350 million of total receivables related to the program, of which we estimate about half of this amount relates to the federal-matched portion of the uncompensated care component. The adjustment in the third quarter is a general estimate against these receivables due to the current uncertainty of the CMS inquiry. The company had been accruing approximately $35 million of revenues per quarter associated with the federal match of the uncompensated care program. And for now, we've elected to discontinue accruing the estimated federal-matched portion until there's more insight into this matter, and we have factored this into our guidance for the remainder of the year. There is not enough information at this time to adequately assess the long-term implications this inquiry may have on the statewide program, but we will continue to monitor events as they unfold. Excluding the net impact of these 2 items, adjusted EBITDA increased 12.4% for the quarter. And when you adjust for these 2 items, EHR incentive income and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA was up 16.5% for the quarter. So let me review some volume numbers. In the third quarter, our same facility admissions increased 2.8% over the prior year, and equivalent admissions increased 4.1%. One-day stays had no material impact on our volume comparisons for the quarter. During the third quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.1% and 3.8% respectively. This includes both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 7.9% on a same facility basis and represent 31% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 9.7% and 12.6% respectively in the quarter. This compared to increases of 1.4% and 2.4% in the first quarter and 7.8% and 8.8% in the second quarter. We continue to see strength in our 5 expansion states, but have also seen strength in our non-expansion states as well, and I'll provide some additional commentary on Medicaid in my health reform remarks. Same-facility self-pay and charity admissions declined 14.8% in the quarter, while equivalent admissions declined 8.9%. This represents 7.3% of our total admissions compared to 8.8% last year. Managed care and exchange admissions increased 3.8%, and equivalent admissions increased 5.6% on a same-facility basis in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility emergency room visits increased 7.3% in the third quarter compared to the prior year, continuing to show solid growth. Same-facility uninsured ER visits represent 20.5% of our total ER visits in the quarter compared to 24.2% last year. Intensity of service or acuity continued to increase in the quarter, with our same-facility case mix increasing 2% compared to the prior year. Same-facility surgical volumes increased 1.7% in the quarter, with same-facility inpatient surgeries increasing 1.4% and outpatient surgeries increasing 1.9% from the prior year. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.8% in the quarter, or 3.5% excluding the impact of the RAC settlement and Texas waiver reserve. Same-facility managed care exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.8% for the quarter, as case mix increased 1.7%. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $148 million in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility charity care discounts totaled $1.024 billion in the quarter, an increase of $149 million over the prior year, while our same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.089 billion, flat with third quarter of last year. Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was very good as we were able to leverage higher intensity of services along with strong volume trends. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.3% compared to last year's third quarter. This helped lead to our 80 basis point margin improvement. Salaries and benefits as a percent of revenue improved by 60 basis points to 45.7% compared to 46.3% in last year's third quarter. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.9% in the quarter on a same-facility basis. Same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 0.6% in the quarter, reflecting continued success on several supply chain initiatives. Other operating expenses improved 20 basis points from last year's third quarter to 18.3% of revenues. We did recognize $32 million in electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $75 million last year, which was consistent with our expectations. We incurred approximately $21 million in EHR expense in the quarter compared to $26 million last year. Let me touch briefly on cash flow. We had another strong quarter, with cash flow from operations increasing to $1.128 billion or 25% above prior year. We currently expect to see RAC settlement dollars in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2015. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.163 billion available under our revolving credit facilities. So let me spend a few minutes updating you on health reform. First, we saw approximately 7,800 exchange admissions and approximately 27,000 exchange emergency room visits for the quarter. This is compared to 5,500 admissions and 19,000 ED visits we saw in the second quarter. As we mentioned previously, the monthly growth projection is slowing, with approximately 2,500 admissions in July, 2,600 in August and 2,700 in September. Based on our look-back of accounts previously seen, we now believe about 44% of our health exchange volume was newly insured. The acuity of exchange volume, using case mix as a measure for intensity, is still running about 8% to 10% higher than our managed care book of business. And as we discussed last quarter, we attribute the majority of this to lower OB volume in the exchange population. Our revenue rate per exchange volumes are similar to commercial clearance rates. We continue to see favorable mix trends in our 5 states that have elected to expand Medicaid. Given timing of pending Medicaid conversion, we believe it's relevant to look at these trends on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis, we've seen a 37% increase in Medicaid admissions and a corresponding 56% decline in uninsured admissions in our 5 expansion states. Our uninsured volume from non-expansion states has also declined approximately 4% on a year-to-date basis, resulting in a total year-over-year decline in uninsured admissions for all states of just under 10% in the 9 months ended September 30. The impact of reform has progressed favorably throughout the year, and we remain optimistic on the long-term benefits of health reform. And accordingly, we revised our full year health reform benefit guidance, where we now estimate a full year positive impact of approximately 4% versus our previous estimate of 2% to 3%. So now let me turn to our revised guidance for 2014. As you read in the release, based upon the strong performance in our core operations and our improved health reform outlook, we have revised our 2014 guidance as follows: We estimate net revenue to be between $36.5 billion and $37 billion versus our July guidance of $36 billion and $36.5 billion. We now estimate adjusted EBITDA to be between $7.25 billion and $7.35 billion. This is an increase from our July guidance of adjusted EBITDA between $7 billion and $7.15 billion. EPS is estimated to be between $4.40 and $4.60, up from our July '14 guidance of $4 and $4.25. Capital spending remains the same at $2.2 billion. So that concludes my comments, and I'll turn it over to Sam for some additional commentary on the quarter.
Samuel N. Hazen: Good morning. As mentioned earlier, our volume growth accelerated in the quarter as compared to the first half of this year. This acceleration was broad-based across most of the company's markets and was also broad-based across the various volume categories of our business. Again, we believe it reflects a combination of solid execution of our growth agenda by our operating teams, improving macroeconomic trends in many of our markets and capital spending that has been invested both to increase access to our networks and to add operational capacity. On a year-over-year basis for the quarter, 10 of our 14 domestic divisions had growth in admissions. All but 3 of our divisions had growth in managed care and exchange admissions. 13 of our domestic divisions had growth in both adjusted admissions and in managed care and exchange adjusted admissions. 13 divisions had growth in emergency room visits, and all divisions had growth in managed care and exchange emergency room visits. EMS transports and trauma volumes this quarter were up 4.4% and 8.9% respectively. Growth in inpatient surgery volumes was generally consistent across all divisions. 3 divisions were up in the -- let me back up. All but 3 divisions were up in the quarter. Orthopedics, cardiovascular and oncology service lines had solid growth. Our hospital-based outpatient surgery volumes were strong. They grew by 3.8% with solid growth in most service lines. 9 divisions had growth in this category. Surgery volumes in our ambulatory surgery division were down 0.5%. Deliveries for the quarter grew 2.7%. 10 divisions had growth in deliveries. Managed care and exchange deliveries grew 9.1%. All but 1 division had growth in this area. Neonatal admissions grew 8.9% in the quarter. Behavioral services admissions grew 9.7% in the quarter. Rehabilitation services admissions grew 12.4%. And finally, average length of stay increased 1.8%, which reflects the increased acuity that was mentioned previously. HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda that we believe is driving results. We continue to invest in it at appropriate levels and we continue to leverage the best practices across our diverse markets. As a result, we believe our local networks are positioned well to compete effectively in their respective markets while delivering high-quality care. Market share trends for the company for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2014, are generally consistent with past trends. Market share grew by 15 basis points to slightly above 24%, with approximately 60% of our markets increasing share across most of the service line categories. Now let me say a few words about the company's preparation for Ebola patients. We, like most health care providers, have redoubled our efforts across the company to make sure our hospitals and outpatient centers are prepared. Additionally, we have taken a closer look at both the lessons learned in the United States and the best practices from around the world on how to treat an Ebola patient. In the event that we would care for an Ebola patient, we have put measures in place both to serve patient needs and to protect our employees and physicians. Should a patient present with Ebola as a potential diagnosis, we will ensure complete isolation of the patient, and we will limit interaction with the patient to the minimal number of staff necessary, pending confirmation of the diagnosis. As you may know, the CDC has been working toward each state designating specific facilities to provide care for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Ebola. Although HCA has none of these centers, we will continue to work with state officials to support this process on a state-by-state basis. As part of our plan, we have put processes in place to ensure availability of personal protective equipment and increase the training of our employees to improve their ability to use the equipment. Next, we have increased our inventory levels of personal protection equipment, and our supply chain team has developed logistical procedures to move product where necessary. Finally, we have put a company-wide organizational process in place to institute structure, policies and procedures. This process, which takes advantage of our scale, will allow us to support a facility if we have a patient encounter. With that, let me turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Sam, thank you. Martina, if you want to come back on, we'll start the Q&A process. [Operator Instructions]
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren Perkin Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Congrats to Milt. I want to ask about just the capital deployment strategy. You've obviously done a lot of buyback over the last couple of years. Just wanted to get a comment from you about buyback going forward. Will you continue to have more of a bolus type of buyback plan? Or do you think we should expect this type of buyback and just have something authorized and you're opportunistic on a more -- a time-bought basis? And then if you could just maybe also comment about dividend and how that fits with your capital deployment strategy going forward.
R. Milton Johnson: Darren, this is Milton. Let me take that on the buyback. First of all, we're very pleased this morning to announce our $1 billion share repurchase. I think we have been very consistent over, really, recent years since coming back into the public markets in 2011 with our capital deployment strategy. I think this is -- this announcement this morning is highly consistent with that. Our first approach, of course, is to reinvest capital back in our existing markets to continue to support our growth strategies across the -- across our various 42 markets. Second, we certainly look for acquisition opportunities. This morning, we announced 2 acquisitions. Of course, nonhospital acquisitions, but we, as I said in my comments, I view as being very strategic to the company going forward. We're also looking at -- continuing to look at a few tuck-in acquisitions and hope to close, for example, the Citrus Hospital here, hopefully very soon. And then we looked at beyond that, either dividends, share repurchase or debt repayment. And I think, again, we've been very consistent that in this market where we're seeing attractive rates on our long-term debt, especially in our leverage ratio around the middle of the range that we have given at 3.5% to 4.5%, we're right under 4%, that we think that we're comfortable with the amount of leverage. So then we look to this buyback opportunity. And as far as dividends, we would not rule that out, but I would not foresee in the near term a regular dividend. We have been paying special dividends over the past 3 years. But with the change in tax laws affecting dividend payments, I believe share repurchase to be a more tax-effective method of returning cash to shareholders.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Regarding the public exchange growth for 2015, obviously, signing up United in all your Texas and Florida hospitals should be helpful. But could you provide any additional color on your public exchange enrollment strategy for 2015 during the open enrollment period?
R. Milton Johnson: All right, Frank. Bill, you want to address...
William B. Rutherford: Sure. Hey, Frank, so as Milton said, I think our approach to 2015 is multipronged, clearly looking at participation in contracts in several of our markets that we talked about. We continue to have our certified application counselors in our facilities and we are partnering and looking at -- and really stepping up our efforts with a couple of national agencies and outreach in our communities to help people gain access to resources around exchange enrollment, both in terms of scheduling community-based events as well as assistance in the enrollment effort. So I think we'll become more active this year than last year in that effort, and we're optimistic as we approach the second year of the enrollment cycle.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Gary Taylor with Citi.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just wanted to go back to the Texas supplemental program, and I was trying to write everything down as -- and I may not have received it all. And also I'm a little stale, I think, on my 10-K disclosure. But I just want to go to the bigger point of -- my understanding was a lot of the supplemental program also had a accompanying provider fee component to it. So there was a revenue amount that was substantially offset by a provider fee payments. And then kind of the net EBITDA benefit from those supplemental programs was something much smaller, a couple of hundred million dollars a year sort of range. So is that recollection correct? Could you kind of update us on what kind of the net impact you could be looking at if this particular program was discontinued?
William B. Rutherford: Yes, it's still early in it. So our reserve we booked in the quarter, really, is around an estimate on our carrying value receivables. There's really a lot of uncertainty around this inquiry. We think the inquiry currently relates to the federal-matched portion of the uncompensated care program, which we estimate, as I mentioned in my comments, about half of our AR balance relates to. So there are a lot of factors at play and a lot of variables we're having to give consideration to, including the fact it was previously approved, got a history of payments under the programs. And so all those kind of came into our thinking around this. As I mentioned, we currently accrue, based on our history, about $35 million a quarter of revenues related to the federal match of the uncompensated care program. And that's what we've elected to discontinue recognizing for this year. We're going to have to continue to monitor it, and it's really too early to make the call for the long-term consequences. But that's what our estimated impact is for the balance of the year.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So there's no reduction in provider fee that goes along with discontinuing that $35 million accrual?
Samuel N. Hazen: No, not -- this is Sam, Gary. Not at this time. I mean, we're constantly evaluating components of the program. They're not necessarily connected per se. And then you have a separate component of the overall waiver, which is the delivery system reform component, and that's somewhat separate as well. And so we're very close to the program in all communities at all levels at this point. And anticipating the state and the federal government to get together shortly and hopefully resolve the questions that were raised in the review. But at this point, there is no change in the structure of the program, and we will just have to monitor it routinely, as Bill indicated.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: If okay, I got one quick follow-up and then my question. So the follow-up is on Darren's capital deployment question. The buyback authorization of $1 billion, would this include any special purchases like you did -- like the one you did from private equity? Or would that be a different pocket in terms of capital deployment?
R. Milton Johnson: Justin, this is Milton. If we -- the authorization does permit the company to enter into privately negotiated transactions. So for example, I think the obvious question is if our sponsors decided to sell more of their ownership, the answer is we could use any portion of this authorization to buy back any portion of their offering.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So essentially, if you -- if the sponsors came and you had $500 million of this left, you would only be able to buy $500 million of the sponsor?
R. Milton Johnson: Under this authorization, that is correct.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then my question's on the core EBITDA growth, obviously, running much higher than initially guided to this year. Just want -- just trying to think about looking out to 2015 and beyond, how should we think about this core growth in terms of sustainability and how management views it?
R. Milton Johnson: Justin, this is Milton again. We're nearing obviously here in that fourth quarter. And 3 months from now, we'll be issuing our guidance for 2015. So I'll reserve our giving guidance about how we think about the long-term growth rate until we complete our work here in the fourth quarter as we budget 2015 and think about the impact. Obviously, we have a lot of momentum here in 2014, but we'll reserve our estimates for 2015 until next call.
Victor L. Campbell: Justin, thank you. Appreciate you trying to get us into '15 guidance, there but...
Operator: We will take our next question from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So just -- with regards to your strong volume growth this quarter, can you provide maybe a little more details of the components of the strength there? Maybe breaking out between reform, maybe product line extensions and maybe more importantly, what you're seeing specifically around economically sensitive volumes. How has that been trending versus year-to-date expectation?
Victor L. Campbell: Sam, you want that one?
Samuel N. Hazen: I think when Bill mentioned the exchange volume and half of it potentially being newly insured, it's still a very small component of the overall volume equation. So it's related as a significant component of the overall growth. I'm struggling to get to that. And it's clearly having a positive impact on our payer mix as indicated in Bill's comments. I think when I look across the volume categories of the company and you see fairly strong growth across just about every metric, I attribute that to a couple of things, and I mentioned that in my comments. First, I do believe the economy is improving. We're seeing a number of HCA's markets with strong job growth, reducing uninsured levels and unemployment levels, and that's having an impact, we believe, on outpatient surgeries. We believe it's having an impact on obstetrics and the volumes that we're seeing there. And we were seeing that, we think, generally across most service lines at some level, but those 2 in particular. And then when you look at the strategies of the company, which have been fairly consistent over the past few years, our execution underneath those strategies to create accessibility to HCA's networks locally is growing. For example, the CareNow acquisition that we're doing is a very significant part of adding access to our DFW market and creating a new outreach into our network there. We continue to invest in service line strategies where we're adding capabilities to our existing networks, allowing us to take care of as many services as possible if a patient needs more advanced care. And then thirdly, the investment strategy of the company, where we stepped up our capital spending over the last 3 or 4 years to a very significant level, is having a positive impact on capacity, availability, technology and putting our facilities in a much more competitive position in the marketplace. And the combination of those things, I think, are driving volume, driving market share for the company. And then our -- the execution of our teams is just very strong, and I'm proud of what they're doing. And I think the net of all those is a very positive accelerating volume picture for the company.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joshua Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just want to talk a little about the surgery volumes. I think I heard the numbers on the inpatient and then on the outpatient side were both up, but I think you said ASC volumes were actually down 0.5%. So I'm just curious in terms of what you think is going on there. Is there some sort of ACA impact that doesn't translate to the stand-alone ASCs? Or maybe any color on surgery?
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, we have not seen as much Affordable Care Act volume inside of the Ambulatory Surgery Divisions as we've seen inside of the hospital. The exchange side of the equation is a little less than what our hospitals are seeing, but we are seeing some exchange-level activity. The ambulatory surgery center division volume decline is really centered around a handful of centers that have had some dynamics, whether it's physician departures or competitor facilities open up. If you look across the portfolio of the 120-or-so surgery centers that we have, more than half of them, almost 2/3 of them are up, but 1/3 of them are down. And of that 1/3, there's some significant declines related to very specific events that aren't really broad-based events and consistent across our markets. We continue to invest in our ambulatory surgery center strategy through incremental acquisitions, through new site development, where we've actually replaced and created new centers. And it's a very viable strategy for HCA with respect to efficiency and service and physician alignment, and you will continue to see the company invest in it. But we are seeing a little more accelerated growth inside of the hospitals. And I'm not sure I can point to specifically why that is, other than we've had a handful of these centers that have struggled, and they've struggled, like I said, for very specific reasons.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Is it possible that the payer mix and the ASC is just typically significantly better, and so you're just not seeing that same level of additional capacity to take in, for example, Medicaid expansion, right, which would not be necessarily attractive for some of the commercial.
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, the ambulatory surgery center division payer mix is slightly better than our hospital-based outpatient surgeries, but not significantly different. But you're right, Medicaid is not seen at a significant level inside of our Ambulatory Surgery Divisions as compared to the hospital. And so in those states where we've seen expansion, we're seeing some Medicaid volumes in our outpatient surgery departments of our hospitals but not in the Ambulatory Surgery Division.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Zimmerman with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering, can you give us a bit more information on the strategic thinking around the CareNow acquisition? And is this the type of acquisition we should be expecting to see more of going forward?
Victor L. Campbell: Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, in DFW in particular, the CareNow acquisition is very strategic. It is a unique company in that they're focused on quality. They're focused on patient service and convenience. And then their geographical alignment with HCA in the DFW market is very good. I think 20 of their 24 centers are within 5 miles of an HCA hospital, so it creates a broader network of offerings inside the company in that particular market. Additionally, we think because their unique model, their volumes per center and their financial results per center, quite frankly are best in class from what we've been able to see. And we're hopeful that we can replicate that model in other markets where we can complement our networks with urgent care centers in a larger way. Now we haven't fully vetted exactly how we're going to do that as of yet. But we do see possibilities with that acquisition and the capabilities of the management team to expand those offerings into other markets. The urgent care business is very fragmented. We do see possibilities for more acquisitions in that front as we work through our market strategies and so forth. Today, the company operates with the CareNow acquisition over 60 urgent care centers in various markets, with some being operated in a joint venture structure, others being wholly owned. So it's a very significant access point for the company and a very high demand kind of center for a lot of our patients who like the accessibility and the convenience and the cost of urgent care centers. So it does expand the offerings of HCA and create capability in the company that we're hopeful we can leverage into a broader strategy that fits our market needs.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I was just wondering if you could just go into why you raised the health care reform benefit as much as you did in your guidance. Because it looks like the reform volumes are growing, but you kind of said that you thought they would continue to grow but slow down. It kind of seems like that came in line with what you thought was going to happen in the -- at least on the exchange side in Q3. It sounded like the rates are about the same and the Q2 is about the same. So what was driving the big increase in the reform benefit?
Victor L. Campbell: Bill?
William B. Rutherford: Yes, so we did see growth third quarter versus second quarter as I mentioned in my comments. With almost 7,800 admissions in the third versus 5,500 in the second, so we saw continued growth. Month-over-month progression is still slowing. Our 4% kind of guidance is really the full year guidance, knowing first quarter was relatively soft. And we know the current period is running a little bit higher than that. So as we project out, really, the remaining 3 months of the year on our current volume run rates and look at our model, it gets us really close to that 4%, maybe a little bit north. The 4% is really a result of we had a solid first quarter with the contributions, but we saw that grow in second quarter over first, third quarter over second, and we're pretty comfortable with that revised guidance.
R. Milton Johnson: And Bill, I think -- I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kevin.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I was going to say so was the Q2 reform guidance just kind of taking that 5,500 and assuming that stays flat, and now you're saying it's 7,800 staying flat in Q4? Is that the way to think about it?
William B. Rutherford: Yes, so -- yes, that's good point -- as the second quarter, we did project some moderation of the growth for the balance of the year, and it did go a little north of that in the third quarter. And we are still projecting some moderation of that month over growth for the balance of the year, and we'll see how that unfolds.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Was interested to get your thoughts on Medicaid expansion, and what states you're watching and what states may be you're most hopeful or even optimistic in? Specifically maybe your thoughts on Tennessee, Virginia and Florida?
Victor L. Campbell: All right, Gary, this is Vic. I'll take that. I think we've got 5 states you all know that have expanded. It appears Utah will be next, so we would expect Utah to come on. Indiana was in the mix, but it appears they have withdrawn their application. Tennessee, we would be hopeful going into next year, post the election, that there would be an opportunity here. Time will tell, but I think that would be maybe the next most likely to consider it. Florida, we'll just have to wait post-election and see what happens in terms of the new governor and in terms of the state legislature. And again I say new governor, whether it's the existing governor or a new governor, I think both support it, so the question is really the legislature down there. And I don't want to put odds on that one, but we would hope that they would see the benefits of that reform.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just a question on reform again and not trying to get into guidance. But as you go through the budgeting process for next year, qualitatively, how are your guys thinking about reform? And how different was that -- for '15 and how different was that for '14 as you say, benchmark against CBO's exchange enrollment estimates? Or just what you're seeing on your current run rate on the exchange enrollment?
R. Milton Johnson: Yes, thank you, Brian. Good question. So as we were going into '14, we were working obviously with a lot of unknowns. We had 4 or 5 kind of key variables as the input. One, what did we think the enrollment was going to be in the exchanges? And we all know the rocky start in January. We're still sitting with a low amount and saw the surge in February and March. We were keying off early with CBO estimates, and the enrollment will likely do the same as we approach the '15 planning until we gain more data points. The other variable we were really dealing with was of that exchange enrollment, how much would be newly insured? And there was a whole lot of estimates in the marketplace with what that number would be. 9 months into it, we're a lot better informed with our own data about that exchange volume that's newly insured. And so get a little bit more precision, if you will, on that estimate based on at least our history to date. And then the Medicaid expansion impact was a variable of how quickly that would affect payer mix and the uninsured volumes. So we'll basically -- and our plan now, is use the same variables and the same model but update our thinking with our experience and with better marketplace information. So it's why I've mentioned in the earlier ones we're going to be a little more assertive in our efforts to help people in our communities gain enrollment and access to community resources. And the enrollment variable is a key number for us as we think about the open exchange period coming up. And we think with the Medicaid expansion and the previously insured percentages, then I think will be 9 months, 12 months better data points in our assumptions for '15.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Crédit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Can you maybe talk about the managed care book? What rates you're capturing for 2015? How much is negotiated for next year? And then if you're seeing any changes in your markets in terms of payers narrowing networks or looking for more risk arrangements?
Victor L. Campbell: Sam's got that one.
Samuel N. Hazen: We are 80% contracted for 2015 and 40% contracted for 2016, and actually about 20% contracted for 2017. All of our terms are largely consistent with our previous terms around both pricing and structure within our contracts. There are some incremental changes here and there to pay-for-performance provisions and so forth. But, largely in our commercial book, very consistent approach by HCA as well as most of the payers. Obviously, the exchange, as we've indicated, is slightly different and more difficult to quantify in the same way as our commercial book because there are new entrants into the exchanges each year and identifying exactly the participation in some of the new contracts related to the exchange is a little bit more difficult than the commercial side of the equation. And then also on the managed government side, our terms and our percentage completion is similar to past patterns and also similar to the completion rate that I just gave you on the commercial side. We think the company is well positioned for any kind of changes as they evolve through our core strategy of making sure we have a very operationally excellent and accessible provider network. Additionally, we're seeing the marketplace move locally, not nationally, because of different dynamics within each of our markets. And so as we process that, it gives us an opportunity to learn to be strategic about those different market experiences and think about it more globally. But for the most part, it's not changing in any significant way as we move into 2015.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I just wanted to go back to the ER comments that you made with respect to reform. I just want to make sure I got some of these numbers correct. Did you say that there were 27,000 exchange ER visits this quarter and 19,000 last quarter?
William B. Rutherford: Yes. Whit, this is Bill. That's correct. That's what I said.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes, so I know this is kind of dangerous, but that would mean that you're exchange mix just with respect to ER went from 1% to maybe 1.5% of total ER. And if I assume that 24% of those old ER visits were uninsured, it might suggest that about 6% of your uninsured ER visits are now coming through an exchange product, which is up a lot since last quarter. And I just want to make sure that I'm thinking about the trajectory of the volume correctly and why that wouldn't likely continue going forward.
William B. Rutherford: Well, 2 things. One, the stats are correct. We had 27,000 exchange EDs in the third quarter. It was up from 19,000 as we've said, both on the inpatient is growing. Your math on the percentage of our exchange volume in total is about right. It's fairly similar with our inpatient admissions. We've not done a study of those emergency room exchanges and how much were newly insured, so its impact on the uninsured, but it's fair to assume until that it's fairly comparable rates. And it really done flow through rate of what that would mean. But as I mentioned in my comments, we've seen the uninsured emergency room business drop from 24 to 20. So we think those trends are embedded in that exchange volume as well as some of the Medicaid expansion activity. And like I said, we haven't got into '15 projections of what that would be. But our projections for the balance of the year are really holding that pretty steady with some moderate growth, so that's the best way I can...
Samuel N. Hazen: Our Medicaid payer mix in the emergency room has grown more than our exchange payer mix has grown in the emergency room. So to Bill's point, at 1.5% of total emergency room visits, we've seen a larger piece in Medicaid growth than we have in the exchange side. And that's happened, as he mentioned, in both expansion states and some in non-expansion states.
Victor L. Campbell: We've got time for one last question.
Operator: We'll take our last question from A.J. Rice with UBS.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Since the last question, I'm going to get one clarification and then one question.
Victor L. Campbell: Just for you, A.J.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: There you go. The clarification, I think I've gotten some questions emailed to me about this, so I wanted to clarify it. Milton had said that I think in response to a question, that if you guys bought $500 million, then you'd only had $500 million to purchase if there was a private equity transaction or something otherwise. I just want to clarify, if I'm reading between the lines of what you're saying, that will be under that authorization. But you're also leaving open the possibility that you could quickly go back to the board and do more if you thought it was in the company's interest to do that. I want to make sure I just clarify that.
R. Milton Johnson: A.J., that would be an option that we would have. I was answering a particular example I think I was given. And if we had $500 million left in the authorization, that's all we could use on that authorization. But there would be -- we would have the option, if we thought it was appropriate, to go back to the board and to seek more availability and more authorization.
Victor L. Campbell: A.J., thanks for raising that clarification. All right, we'll let you have your other question now.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: All right. I guess I was just going to ask -- I know lots of times, obviously, with the focus right now on the top line and on the benefit of the reform, maybe some of the cost initiatives take second -- backseat. But I just wondered if there's anything supply-wise, other operating expense initiatives you'd talk to. And then also just in the nursing side, is the growth that you're seeing putting any pressure on productivity rates or vacancy rates or turnover rates? Give us sort of some quick comments on some of the big cost buckets and what you're seeing.
Victor L. Campbell: All right, Sam, try to get through that before lunch if you could.
Samuel N. Hazen: We're very pleased with the operating leverage that we're creating inside the company. And when you look at normalized for some of the waiver adjustments that have occurred over the course of the year. The clearance, the EBITDA clearance on the incremental revenue growth, has been very consistent and almost 2x our average margin. And that's come from very significant operating leverage across the organization. Our productivity levels are significantly improved on a year-over-year basis. And we've been able to do that with wage increases that have been consistent with our plan. We are, however, because of some of the volumes, seeing a little bit of an acceleration in our contract labor and our registry nurse utilization, not significantly different than what we saw in the first half of the year, but slightly up. But in the other categories of our spend, in supplies and other expenses and so forth, I mean the company continues to evolve its strategy around trying to find ways to get more efficient. And that involves expanding our supply chain deeper into the hospital operations in a couple of areas in particular. And I've mentioned these before: pharmacy and surgery, in particular, are areas where we are moving our supply chain deeper into our operations and creating a better controlled system for purchasing, and at the same time freeing our teams up to interact with our physicians and other clinicians to drive improvement in pharmacy utilization and other type of clinical utilization. And that is helping us identify and move our agenda. On the other expenses, most of our other expenses are fixed in nature. And so as we can drive more volume and we can drive more revenue growth, we tend to create some margin expansion in those areas. But the company is focused on leveraging its scale where it can. We have a oneHR initiative we're calling that where we're consolidating our human resource function, which we believe is going to create some synergies and at the same time give us better visibility into our labor cost, which we think will drive some incremental improvement. And then as I've mentioned in previous calls, A.J., we've also deployed our performance-based improvement teams from the corporate office to the divisions. We think that's going to enhance our ability to execute on best practices, identify continual improvements in performance improvement initiatives in our key areas of our facilities. And then the last thing I would say is we're getting better in HCA at using internal data to benchmark and identify ways to marry up clinical improvement, operational efficiency and physician engagement, and that's part of this operational excellence agenda that we've got to position our provider networks to be very effective. So we're very pleased with where we are. We think we've got reasonable initiatives in place to manage the trends on a go-forward basis, and we'll give you more detail on that as we move into 2015.
Victor L. Campbell: All right, A.J., Sam, thank you. Thank everyone on the call, and we will see you soon.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Travis, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome everyone on today's call, including those of you listening to the webcast. With me here this morning, as usual, our President and CEO, Milton Johnson; CFO and Executive VP, Bill Rutherford; and Sam Hazen, President of Operations. And then we have several other members of the senior management team with us as well to assist during the Q&A. Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. And this call is being recorded, and a replay will be available later today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton Johnson.
R. Milton Johnson: Thanks, Vic, and good morning to each of you joining our call. We hope you've had a chance to review our second quarter 2014 earnings release we issued this morning. I will cover a few highlights, then I will turn the call over to Bill Rutherford and Sam Hazen. This morning's second quarter release is consistent with our July 16 preview of the second quarter's results. We're very pleased with the results, and saw a continuation, and in many cases, improvement in trends from recent quarters. Volume trends were solid. expense management was excellent, and improving payor mix and increasing acuity continue to drive higher revenue per equivalent admission. Results for the quarter exceeded our own internal expectations, with our core operations driving much of the upside to the quarter. As a result, we are raising our full year 2014 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. In our second quarter of health care reform, we experienced continued growth in exchange and Medicaid volume, with fairly noticeable reductions in our uninsured volume. Generally, in the second quarter of 2014, core operations contributed approximately 2/3 of our adjusted EBITDA growth, and health care reform contributed approximately 1/3. Bill will provide more detail on health care reform in a moment. However, as noted in our revised guidance, we now believe health care reform will comprise 2% to 3% of our 2014 adjusted EBITDA growth, up from 1% to 2% in our earlier guidance. Although there remain many uncertainties, based on the results from the second quarter, we are forecasting more favorable trends than we had originally. We believe we are well positioned to succeed in the health care reform marketplace. As a management team, we remain confident in our key operating strategies to deliver leading quality and services, drive growth through distinctive physician and patient relationships, improve the efficiency of our service delivery, develop a well-informed response to an evolving market environment and to be a preferred place for work for all of our employees. Moving to the quarter. Revenues increased 9.2% to $9.23 billion over last year's second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $2 billion in the quarter, an increase of 18.5%. This includes the $142 million increase in Texas Medicaid waiver revenues recognized during the quarter. Normalizing for this, adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 10% over the prior year second quarter. Excluding electronic health record incentive income, share-based comp and the additional Texas Medicaid waiver revenues recognized in the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 12% over the prior year. And year-to-date, is 9.2% greater than the prior year. Net income attributable to HCA Holdings totaled $483 million. Net income before gains from sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt was $619 million or $1.37 per diluted share compared to $0.91 in last year's second quarter. Diluted shares for the quarter were 453 million, down from the 463 million in 2013. During the quarter, we repurchased $750 million of our stock or 14.555 million shares at a net offering price of $51.53 per share. And during the past 9 months, we have repurchased $1.25 billion of our stock. A significant highlight of the second quarter was cash flow generation. In the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities totaled $1.25 billion, up $436 million over the second quarter of last year, a 53.6% increase. Free cash flow was $627 million in the quarter. Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately 84% of the 750 million share repurchase completed in the quarter. Our managed care contracting team is highly focused on our 2015 exchange contracting strategy. We are in discussions with all the major health plans regarding their expansion markets or new products in existing exchange markets. Our 2015 exchange contracting is proceeding well. For example, today, we are pleased to announce we have finalized exchange contracts with UnitedHealthcare for all of our Texas markets. Also, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas added our Houston, San Antonio and El Paso facilities to their existing networks since the first quarter of this year. I want to take a moment to commend our Chief Medical Officer and Clinical Services Group President, Dr. Jon Perlin, for the service he is presently providing as a senior adviser to the acting VA Secretary. Effective July 15, 2014, John has been on a 60-day leave of absence from his HCA duties. As I said, when John's temporary appointment was announced publicly, HCA has a long tradition of support for America's service members, their families and for our nation's veterans, and we are proud that he can assist the VA during this challenging time. We're very supportive of his willingness to do this for the VA and confident that his efforts will lead to continued improvement and access to care for our nation's veterans. HCA is fortunate to have the strong leadership of Dr. Tom Garthwaite, Dr. Perlon's Chief Operating Officer in Our Clinical Services group, to step up and lead CSG in Jon's absence. Also, I want to congratulate Chris Taylor, our new President of Parallon. As many of you know, Chris had been with HCA for many years and has 30 years of experience in the healthcare business, most recently as Parallon's CFO. He has been serving as interim President there and has done a fabulous job leading that organization. Chris will continue to report to Bill Rutherford, and we look forward to seeing great things in the future from Chris and his team. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William B. Rutherford: Thanks, Milton, and good morning, everybody. I will cover some additional detail around the second quarter results, health reform and our 2014 guidance. As Milton stated earlier, we were very pleased with the quarter's results. The second quarter results were due to continued strong performance in our core business and increasing impact from health reform. Within the core business, we have seen strengthening volumes, increased intensity of services and very good expense management. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $2 billion from $1.689 billion last year, which was also a very good quarter. The second quarter of 2014 includes $142 million adjustment related to the Texas Medicaid waiver program, which we received in the quarter, which as we mentioned in the release relates to receipts of reimbursements in excess of our estimates for the indigent care component of this program for the year ended September 30, 2013. In the second quarter, our same facility total admissions increased 1.2% over the prior year and equivalent admissions increased 2.2%. We experienced a 70-basis-point reduction in our admissions in the quarter due to declines in 1-day stays. Adjusting for 1-day stays, same facility admissions would have increased 1.9%. During the second quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.6% and 2.3%, respectively. Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 5.7% on a same facility basis and represented 30.2% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 7.8% and 8.8%, respectively, in the quarter. This compares to increases of 1.4% and 2.4%, respectively, in the first quarter of this year. This was driven by continued growth in our 4 Medicaid expansion states, as well as growth in a number of our non-expansion states as well. I will provide some additional commentary on Medicaid expansion in my health reform remarks. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions declined 14.7% in the quarter, while equivalent admissions declined 4.9%. Self-pay and charity admissions represent 6.8% of our total admissions compared to 8.1% last year. These results continue to trend favorably to our recent history. Managed care and exchange admissions increased 1.6%, and equivalent admissions increased 2.5% on a same facility basis in the quarter. Same facility emergency room visits increased 5.7% in the quarter compared to the prior year. This represents the highest rate of growth in our ERs in 5 quarters. Same facility self-pay and charity ER visits represent 20.7% of our total compared to 23.4% in last year's second quarter. Consistent with recent trends, intensity of service continue to increase with our same facility case mix, increasing 1.7% over the prior year. Same facility surgical volume contributed as inpatient surgeries increased 1%, while outpatient surgeries declined 0.3%. This helped to drive stronger revenue intensity. Same facility revenue per equivalent admissions in the quarter increased 5.4% or 3.5% if you exclude the Texas Medicaid revenues recorded in the quarter. Same facility managed care and exchange revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.9% in the quarter. Case mix increased 2.8%. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $193 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care discounts totaled $894 million in the quarter or an increase of $98 million over the prior year, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.112 billion, an increase of $95 million from last year's second quarter. Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter was very good, as we're able to leverage the intensity of services along with increased volume. As reported, our adjusted EBITDA margins for the second quarter increased 170 basis points from 20.0% to 21.7%. Adjusted for the $142 million Texas Medicaid item, HITECH revenue and share-based compensation, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points from 19.7% to 20.5%. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.3% over the prior year. As noted in our income statement this morning, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved by 110 basis points to 44.4% compared to 45.5% last year. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.4% on a same facility basis. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 1.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and other operating expenses were flat with the prior year at 17.8% of revenues. We did recognize $35 million in electronic health record income in the quarter compared to $52 million last year, which was consistent with our expectations. We also incurred about $32 million in EHR-related expense in the quarter compared to $33 million last year. I'll briefly touch on cash flows. We had a really strong cash quarter, as cash flows from operations increased to $1.25 billion from $814 million in last year's second quarter. In addition to growth in core operations and related net income, cash flow was favorably impacted by Texas Medicaid waiver payment and improved working capital. At June 30, the company's ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.16x compared to 4.32x as of December of 2013. At the end of the quarter, the company had approximately $1.662 billion available under its revolving credit facilities. So now let me spend a few minutes on health reform. First, we saw just under 5,500 exchange admissions for this quarter and just over 19,000 exchange emergency room visits. The progression we saw in the first quarter continued into April with about 1,300 admissions in April, 2,000 in May and 2,200 in June. So the month-over-month growth did taper off towards the end of the quarter. Based on our look-back of accounts previously seen, we now believe about 40% of our health exchange volume was newly insured. We get asked about the acuity or intensity of this exchange volume. And using case mix as the measure for intensity, our case mix for exchange patients is about 10% higher than our managed care book of business. We attribute the majority of this to lower OB volume in the exchange as a percent of total versus the OB volume in our commercial line of business. We are collecting our exchange volumes at rates similar to our commercial reimbursement. We continue to see favorable mix trends in our 4 states that initially expanded Medicaid. New Hampshire is now our fifth state that recently expanded coverage as well. Given timing of pending Medicaid conversions, we believe it's relevant to look at trends on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis, we have seen a 32% increase in Medicaid admissions and a corresponding 48% decline in uninsured admissions year-to-date in our 4 expansion states. It is interesting to note that uninsured volume from non-expansion states has also declined just under 2% on a year-to-date basis, resulting in a total year-over-year decline in uninsured admissions for all states of 6.6% year-to-date as of June 30. Although uncertainty still remains for the balance of the year around utilization rates, potential impact of nonpayment of premiums and other factors, we remain optimistic on the long-term benefits of health reform, and accordingly have revised our full year health reform benefit from 1% to 2% of adjusted EBITDA to 2% to 3% of adjusted EBITDA for full year 2014. So now let me turn to our revised guidance for 2014. As you read in the release, based upon the strong performance in core operations and our improved health reform outlook, we have revised our 2014 guidance as follows. We estimate net revenue to be between $36 billion and $36.5 billion versus our original guidance of $35.5 billion to $36.5 billion. We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be between $7 billion and $7.15 billion. This is an increase from our original guidance of EBITDA between $6.6 billion and $6.85 billion. EPS is estimated to be between $4 and $4.25, up from our original 2014 guidance of $3.45 to $3.75. This does take into account our recently completed share repurchase and our bond refinancing completed earlier in the quarter. Capital spending guidance remains at $2.2 billion. So that concludes my comments, and I'll turn it over to Sam for additional commentary on the quarter.
Samuel N. Hazen: Good morning. I'll begin my comments this morning with more detail on same facilities volume for the quarter, and then provide a quick update on market share trends for the company. As mentioned earlier, our volumes improved in the quarter. This improvement was broad-based across most of the company's markets, and we believe it reflects a combination of solid execution of our growth agenda by our operating teams, improving macroeconomic trends in many of our markets and capital spending that has been deployed, both to increase access to our networks and to add operational capacity. For the quarter, 9 of our 14 domestic divisions had growth in admissions. 2 were essentially flat and 3 were down. 9 of 14 divisions had growth in managed care and exchange admissions. 3 were essentially flat and 2 were down. 11 of our domestic divisions had growth in adjusted admissions. Of the remaining 3 divisions, 1 was flat. All but 2 divisions had growth in managed care and exchange adjusted admissions. 13 out of 14 divisions had growth in emergency room visits, and all divisions had growth in managed care and exchange emergency room visits. Growth in inpatient surgery volumes was generally consistent across our divisions. All but 4 divisions, were up for the quarter. Orthopedics, cardiovascular and neuroscience service lines had solid growth. Hospital-based outpatient surgeries were up slightly, while surgeries in our ambulatory surgery division were down 1%. Deliveries for the quarter grew 2.2%, which is consistent with the first quarter's growth. However, managed care and exchange deliveries grew 7.3%, which is an improvement in the rate of growth, as compared to the first quarter. These trends were generally consistent across most divisions. Neonatal admissions grew 9.3% in the quarter, behavioral service admissions grew 6.5% and rehabilitation services grew 10.5%. And finally, average length of stay increased 1.9%, which reflects the increased acuity that was mentioned previously. Now let me transition to some market share highlights for the 12 months ended December 2013. Once again, this information is the most current information available, and represents approximately 90% of the company's markets. Inpatient market share for the company grew 17 basis points to 24.1%. The company gained share in 13 of 18 service lines. We gained share in 54% of our markets, with growth in 8 of our top 10 earning markets. Market share in the commercial segment improved modestly. And then during this period, overall market demand at HCA's markets declined 45 basis points, reflecting the effects of leap year and a softer flu season in the fourth quarter. HCA has a comprehensive growth agenda, and we continue to invest in it with capital, people, technology and best practices. As a result, we believe our local networks are positioned well to continue in competing effectively in their respective markets and delivering high-quality care. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Thanks, gentlemen. Travis, if you'd come back on and, we'll go ahead and start the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Travis?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just some numbers questions here. Can you give us some color on geographic disparity in terms of volume growth, what you saw going through the quarter? And then I apologize if I missed it, but uninsured volumes, can you tell us what they did, and specifically maybe breakout Medicaid opt-in states versus those that didn't?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Sam, do you want to sort of do the general geographic stuff. And then, Bill, you pick up the second half?
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, I mean, the fact that most of our divisions had volume growth speaks to the geographic dispersion of our performance, and the fact that it was fairly consistent across the company. I'm trying to think at how to say it any different than I've already said it, Justin. If you look inside the divisions, the one market where we had some difficulties -- actually, we had 2 markets where we had a little bit of difficulties inside of certain divisions from an admission standpoint, and that was DFW in Denver. And we have specific explanations as to what's going on there, and we feel like we're in pretty good shape with our response. But when you look across the states in total though, we had solid performance in Florida. We had solid performance in Nevada. We had solid performance in most of our Texas markets, in California. So we had really broad-based overall performance on most of our volume metrics, which is encouraging. And again, I think it reflects to the factors that I mentioned on the call.
Victor L. Campbell: Bill, you want to pick up...
William B. Rutherford: Yes. Justin, on your uninsured, uninsured admissions for the quarter were down 14.7%. And year-to-date, we're down 6.6% for the company. If I look at just the expansion states, and we look at really a year-to-date trend, year-to-date Medicaid volume in those expansion states is up 32%, and our uninsured volume in those expansion states are down 48%.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And I think just the last numbers question I had asked was around the trajectory of the quarter. We're hearing maybe some pickup in May and June versus April, but just can you give us some color on volumes as you went through the quarter? And if you want to throw July in there, I'd love to hear that as well.
Victor L. Campbell: Justin, nice try. You know it's better than that. And actually, we don't do much on the quarterly or the monthly trends. We did do a little bit on the...
William B. Rutherford: But we had some calendar differences across the quarter. So we had more business days in the month of June than we did last year. So June was naturally higher as a result of the calendar effects. But if you normalize for that, we had fairly consistent performance across each of the months in the quarter.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess, my question relates to exchanges and sort of your networking strategy. And so as I think about the impact, I know you guys gave great color. I think you said 2,200 admits from exchanges in June. Is it fair to say that would sort of be seasonally adjusted sort of towards the higher end, and you wouldn't expect much more exchange membership coming through? And then as you think about '15, do you expect a real increase in your presence from an exchange perspective or any other sort of big changes in your networking strategy for next year?
William B. Rutherford: Josh, this is Bill. I'll take the first part of the question. As we went through the first quarter, we talked about the progression doubling each month. We saw that continuing to the early part of April. We purposely wanted to give you the monthly ones because it is starting to, month over month, taper off. Part of the uncertainty of where will that go for the balance of the year and what will be that trend line, I think it's fair in our projections that we project that to slow, and in terms of its month-over-month growth, and unclear if it's hit its high watermark yet. But in our outlook for health reform, we are looking to taper that off at least for the balance of the year.
Victor L. Campbell: And Sam, you want...
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, I need to speak yet to the, I guess, the managed care strategy, I mean, exchange strategy. Again, I think what -- our first year, we're very pleased with the results so far of our strategy for 2014. As I mentioned, in my comments, we definitely will be expanding with United in the state of Texas, with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas also as an expansion of exchange networks there. And I think, as I've said, we're in discussions with all the major plans regarding exchange contracting for 2015. So I think you will continue to see our contracts and our networks evolve over time as we watch the marketplace. So I don't see it as a static, I see it as something that we'll be looking at on a continuous basis, and hopefully being able to improve our position, which I think today is already well-positioned.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren Perkin Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So I wanted to touch on just the acuity topic, and you gave us a sense for the acuity levels in your exchanges in terms of what you're seeing. I guess I'd really be interested in just getting some commentary from you about the overall trend in acuity and anything that might look different to you in the environment or is this more a function of your service line development?
Victor L. Campbell: Sam, do you want to take that one?
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, we've said over time, we expect the acuity of our inpatient business to grow simply because there are technologies and other venues for certain lower acuity business that can be moved into the outpatient arena and so forth. So from that standpoint, there's going to be a natural increase, we believe, in our acuity metric, which is the case mix index. Having said that, the company is very intentional about developing more capabilities inside of our service lines, deepening the capability with more tertiary and quaternary level capabilities. And that effort continues to evolve. We continue to invest in that in a very significant way with physician strategy, with the facility investment and technology investment. And so that is an ongoing piece of our business and drives our case mix also. The trends that you saw in the quarter are fairly consistent with what we've seen in the past few quarters. And we're generally in line with our internal expectations on our case mix index.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I was interested in the Texas market, specifically a non-expansion state. I was curious what you have seen -- any additional commentary you can give us on how volume trends have developed there? And do you feel that this heavily subsidized public exchange enrollment is really helping drive growth in that market, even though that's a state that didn't expand Medicaid? And then as a follow-up, just any specific strategies that you might want to call out that are helping drive volume growth other than just ACA or the economy?
Victor L. Campbell: Bill, you may have the numbers on Texas, and then, Sam, maybe you want to talk about strategies?
William B. Rutherford: Yes, Texas showed great growth during the quarter, a couple of points, which was higher than the company average. We are seeing Medicaid growth in Texas, which is in line with what the company average is, as you mentioned in line with the enrollment. And a decent amount of exchange volume as well throughout the state of Texas.
Victor L. Campbell: Sam, strategies?
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, nothing materially changed in our growth agenda. I mean, we've been very consistent in how we've designed our growth agenda within each of our local markets. I mean, it centers around creating a sufficient and adequate access to our facilities, creating, as I said previously, a comprehensive array of service lines, and then being very intentional about physician engagement strategies in responding to our physician community in a very substantial way. And those components are getting resourced at a very high level. We've increased our capital spending, as you've heard before. We've increased organizational talent within the company to support these initiatives, and we're building it on a platform that we believe is very competitive around how we've developed quality initiatives, patient satisfaction initiatives, efficiency initiatives and so forth. So the combination of that is consistent and being executed, we think, very, very effectively. We're actually in the process of doing midyear reviews, which is something we do routinely. And we will continue to evaluate and determine what adjustments, if any, are needed in our individual local market strategies.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Zimmerman with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I know it's early on, but there's been a lot of discussion in D.C. in the last couple of days around the ability of VA patients to seek care outside of the traditional VA system. I'm just curious what your thoughts are on this potential opportunity?
Victor L. Campbell: Brian, I'll take that. It appears, as of yesterday, I think most of you were aware of the press conference that was held, that it appears that they have come to a compromise. The conferees have come together. We're hopeful that maybe before they leave on their August recess, they will pass a piece of legislation. I think they're talking about a bill that's around $12 billion. Good news is we're not being asked to pay for it. The largest portion of it's emergency funding. So we think it's good. It's good for veterans. Exactly how it will play out, what the opportunities will be for private care, yet to be seen. As we've told you in the past, we are well positioned in a number of cities and some states, where there is a good veteran population. So we're there to serve. We've got some contracts now. And we would anticipate that we will be participating to some degree once it passes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Crédit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Can you maybe talk a little bit about your managed care book, what rates you're capturing, how much have you negotiated for next year? And I guess if you're seeing any changes from payors in your markets, whether it's tighter networks or pushing you to more to sort of take risk, and whether that sort of played into some of your, I guess, increased discussions with them in terms of, I guess, getting more in-network with banks?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Sam, you want that -- or you want Juan to pick up here?
Samuel N. Hazen: Let me start, and then, Juan, you can fill in the gaps here. At this particular point in time, for 2015, we have approximately 3/4 of our overall commercial book negotiated and contracted at consistent terms, consistent pricing and then consistent network configuration. So we haven't seen any substantial change in our core commercial book. As it relates to evolving strategies with payors, we're always interested in working with our payor partners on developing approaches that make sense for them, that make sense for us. But outside of the exchanges, we're not seeing any significant changes in the overall configuration of our managed care contract. We're actually about 40% contracted for 2016. That, too, is very consistent with past practices and even 2015's strategies. Within the exchanges, as Milton said, we continue to evolve, and we think there are opportunities in certain markets where different network configurations may make sense for us. And as we look today, we probably have about 60% access to all the contracts inside the exchanges within our market. My estimation is that we'll grow some with the United announcement and some of the other payor announcement. And so we are looking to expand that in an appropriate way. And as we study and learn more about how the exchange business is developing within each of our markets, we'll be able to adjust that strategy appropriately.
R. Milton Johnson: I don't think there's much to add there. Thank you. Thank you, Ralph.
Operator: Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Bill, for the Texas Medicaid waiver plan, how much of the $142 million was in-period versus out-of-period? And also, can we get an idea of what an annual expectation is for that program going forward? I know there's some moving pieces. And then also, I'm just kind of curious why there wasn't an accrual made for that within the first quarter?
William B. Rutherford: Great. Thanks, Whit. So let me give you a little bit of commentary on that. And as you know, we're in the third year of a 5-year waiver program for Texas. The second year ended 9/30 of '13. The payments we've received under the waiver program are funded by these intergovernmental transfers from taxing districts and other district hospitals. And the IGT amounts to fund any waiver payment can vary based on several different variables that we don't always have visibility into. And so we did have an accrual on the books, but the amounts that we received were in excess of the amounts that we had accrued for, and it did relate for the year-end 9/30 of '13. So we view that as kind of a onetime adjustment. We have current accruals that we recognize that are reflective of what we think our best estimate is based on the current payment schedule.
Operator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I just thought I might ask, obviously, a lot of this is probably being driven by the top line, but you're showing margin improvement, particularly if you x out HITECH year-to-year. And I wondered if is that -- would you say -- what you're seeing on the cost side is strictly leveraging the good top line performance that you're highlighting or is there some things going on, on the cost side that would be worth highlighting? I know you anniversaried your big cost-cutting program from a year ago, and yet still seem to show good margin improvement here. So I'm curious about that. Any cost initiatives worth highlighting?
Victor L. Campbell: Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, I think, clearly, the leverage, the operating leverage of the company will showcase this quarter with a significant margin expansion given the revenue that we had. So our clearance on that incremental revenue was very positive, A.J. Underneath that, though, I'm proud of what our operating teams are doing to drive efficiencies, recognizing that that's just a core responsibility of our team, and we have numerous agendas, as I've mentioned before, where I think we're continuing to find opportunities in our supply chain. We continue to find opportunities. For example, we're expanding aspects of our supply chain into pharmaceutical distribution and pharmaceutical warehousing, where we think we can gain a better control over our drug inventory and our drug distribution within our systems. That frees up our pharmacy managers to work with our physicians on better formulary management and so forth, on our clinical excellence agenda, where we are moving on certain service lines to improve really the performance of the service line. We're finding opportunities to create clinical processes that are more efficient, more effective for our patients, and at the same time, producing cost results. And I think we've gotten smarter about a couple of other agenda items inside the company, and that's helped us manage the cost trends. And in particular, that's with our physician strategy, where we've been able to come up with some creative ways to accomplish our physician initiatives and our overall engagement there, and the combination of all that has been powerful. And then obviously, on labor, I mean, labor management is a day-to-day thing. Our teams are incredibly well-equipped and capable at executing on that. And you saw a very effective deployment of different elements of our labor management strategies to drive margin expansion on that front. And then the final thing I would say is, and I mentioned it a couple of calls ago, where we have deployed our process improvement teams from the corporate office into each of our divisions. And I think that's going to be a very innovative organizational solution for HCA, where it brings expertise in different areas. It puts our process improvement teams more closely aligned with our operating teams in the field as opposed to the episodic approach that we had in the past. And that structure is going to assist us with finding new opportunities, in my estimation, in helping us maintain our cost.
Victor L. Campbell: Milton, you want to...
R. Milton Johnson: Well, I think Sam gave a very thorough answer to the question, but I'll maybe just highlight one aspect. And one thing that we're doing today, and I think we're early stages into it, is using data analytics and big data techniques in terms with our clinical agenda. And what we're seeing is improved outcomes, improved quality, but also, I think, improving cost as a result. So it's a win-win. I think we're early into that. Sam mentioned clinical excellence. That's a program. I think that illustrates that very well. And so we're excited about the future as we continue that. We're adding physician talent to support that as well, as well as technology talent. So that's an area, I think, over the coming years, you will hear more about. And we're now seeing, I think, the early stages of the benefits of some of that work.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I guess the one thing that I'd be interested to get your insights on and it's more theoretical. But when you think about the persistency of demand from the newly insured, I mean, I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for whether you think that the people who are using the system right now with new insurance, if that's going to persist for several quarters or several years and will be sort of chronically higher with the uses of the system or that over time, it sort of winds down a little bit?
Victor L. Campbell: Anybody want to... Bill
William B. Rutherford: I'll try, and then people can add on. I think that is one of the variables where there's a lot of uncertainty in. And we read about it, that's what we're keeping our eyes on. I think one can kind of argue that as people get newly insured, there may be some pent-up demand. And so in the early periods of coverage, that's where you start to see some of the higher demand and maybe some of the outpatient and others trails off. And I think the uncertainty around the future of health reform is that's just a factor of utilization trends we're going to have to monitor. As we look forward and see really the progression throughout the early periods of health reform, we have seen higher utilization rates than maybe we originally anticipated. Where do they go for the balance of the year? We are making some assumptions that the month-over-month grow will moderate, but will still grow. So I think we'll just have to continue to rely on the inpatient demand versus there might be a trailing outpatient demand for that new coverage.
Victor L. Campbell: And Sam, you want to...
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, I think we need to pull the demand discussion up a little higher than just the exchange piece. And when you look at HCA's markets, and we've talked about this before, I mean, we think we have some great markets. We think the trends within those markets are improving, and we're seeing some of that in the results in the second quarter. And so the demand discussion, I think, is more relevant at the top than it is just inside of the small subset of our overall business. And we're encouraged by the developments in a lot of our markets, and we're hopeful that we'll continue to see positive signs there.
Victor L. Campbell: And Milton, you had a couple stats as you look at some...
R. Milton Johnson: Yes. To Sam's point about pulling it up, so let's pull up and think about in our markets the overall economy, and we're seeing improvement in the economy. And I've got a few stats here. These are from national bureaus and the like and data banks. But -- and unfortunately, national data's more current than state and then down to the MSA level, but just to give you a couple. So one thing we look at is sales tax growth. So if you look at our -- HCA's top 6 states, in 4 of the 6, we are seeing sales tax growth equal or exceeding the national averages, are 67% of our top 6 states. If you look at birth rate changes, they're in our top 6 states. 50% of our 3 of our top 6 states where we operate, again, growth higher than the national averages or benchmarks. And then just on the MSAs, and I think these 2 are very important, overall unemployment percent are -- now you go to the MSA level, look in HCA's top 10 markets, 100% or 10 out of 10 of our markets have overall unemployment rates that are lower than the national averages. And if you look at the trend change and how that's changing, in 6 of our 10 top markets, we're seeing improvement faster than the national averages. So I think that gives us some view that some of this improvement may be based upon some underlying improvement in the economies in some of our markets and states where we do business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just wanted to go back to reform for a minute. Obviously, you guys raised your guidance for reform for the year. Wanted to understand, I guess, a few things. First, what were the main drivers? It seems like you've highlighted a number of things. Just trying to understand exactly how each of them contributed around? It looks like maybe you're expecting more of the people that were exchanged to actually be newly insured. You talked in the past about STERIS. Has that assumption changed at all? It sounds like acuity has changed a little bit as you're -- how did pricing impact that assumption? So if you can go to the kind of the main pushes and takes around what drove it, and maybe what's changed or what hasn't changed. And then finally, as you think about the second half of the year, it seems to me like your guidance basically assumes that the Q2 reform benefit is flat in Q3 and Q4. I just want to make sure that I had that right.
Victor L. Campbell: Yes. Bill, you want to...
William B. Rutherford: Kevin, this is Bill. I'll try to answer that. So when we went in and gave our original guidance in January, there were clearly a lot of uncertainties as we went into health reform. Enrollment in exchanges was uncertain at the time, the kind of what the utilization patterns were being newly insured. And we talked through that in our January call. So a couple of things have kind of been updated now that we've got 6 months or so of experience. I think one of the first ones is enrollment was greater than we originally anticipated. At the time in January, we were sitting there with probably 2.5 million, 3 million people enrolled in exchanges and used some assumptions, as you know, bouncing off CBO estimates, and we saw that exceed. So I think that is really a key driver. And then the corresponding utilization and how it ramped up was probably a little bit more. It happened a lot faster than maybe we anticipated. And then I'd say the other third variable would be is in the Medicaid expansion states, the shift into the decline in uninsureds and the increase in Medicaid in those 4 expansion states, even though it's a relatively small percentage of our footprint, about 12% of our beds. I think that change in mix happened quicker than maybe originally anticipated. So those are really, I think, the 3 major variables that as we've got 6 months now of reform experience. And this has caused us to revise what our original estimates were in January, where we didn't have a lot of visibility into those factors.
Operator: Our last question today comes from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I'm going to try to squeeze just one clarifier in before my question there. You've mentioned that, I think, out of non-Medicaid expansion states are down 2% in uninsured volumes year-to-date, but if I'm not mistaken, you were up about 6% in the first quarter. So does that imply actually an 8% decline in those states in the second quarter? And then just thinking about, sorry, network access here, you had strong emergency room visits in the quarter. Were you seeing any -- out of network lives? And did that affect any of your views on exchange contracting going forward?
William B. Rutherford: This is Bill. Your numbers were correct on that in terms of the uninsured in our non-expansion states. And so we did see some developments occur through there. You still have some Medicaid access and health exchanges of newly insured that is affecting the uninsured declines in our non-expansion states as well. So we read those as positive developments as well. Relative to the out-of-network, in-network, still the majority of our exchanged volume is in network. We are seeing some of that on an out-of-network basis. And our kind of collection rates of our exchange population is really consistent with the collection patterns that we are seeing for our entire book of business.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Andrew, thank you. Milton, you want to -- anything you want to close with?
R. Milton Johnson: Sure. No questions on our capital allocation. And I thought it was interesting. Now this is the third anniversary quarter since our IPO in 2011. And just looking at the amount of cash flow generated and the allocation of that capital, I thought, was an interesting point. Our net cash provided by operating activities since the IPO in 2011 is $12.5 billion of cash flow from operations. Our first priority has been to reinvest in our existing markets, existing assets and expanding our access points in our markets. And there, we have spent $6.1 billion of cash. Acquisitions, $2.4 billion of cash in the past 3 years, most of that being the HealthONE acquisition a few years ago. Special dividends, distributions to stockholders, $3.2 billion. And then repurchase of our common stock, I mentioned in my comments that in the last 9 months, we had repurchased $1.25 billion. But over the last 3 years, that actually totals just under $2.8 billion of share repurchase. So I think that what this illustrates over the last 3 years, the company has been very opportunistic in terms of its capital allocation methodology and approach. And I see that's what we will continue to do in the future.
Victor L. Campbell: All right, Bill, thank you. Thank everyone. Thank everyone, on the call, and Mark Kimbrough is anxiously awaiting all of your calls. So you all have a great day.
Operator: That concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.

Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. And today's call is being recorded. Replay will become available later today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton Johnson
Milton Johnson: Thanks Vic, and good morning to everyone joining us on our first quarter call and broadcast. We were pleased with our performance for the first quarter as we generally saw continuation of recent trends in many key operating metrics. As Sam will describe in a moment, our market share trends remain positive. Of course this quarter reflects the long awaited first coverage period for expanded Medicaid and helped exchange insurance products. We saw encouraging signs from healthcare reform during the quarter and found them to be consistent with our early expectations. Bill will provide details on healthcare reform in his comments, but as expected healthcare reform had minimal impact on the company's first quarter results. However we remain optimistic regarding the long term benefits of reform. We remain comfortable with our previous guidance regarding the estimated impact of healthcare reforms on our financial results for 2014. Now, moving to the quarter's results, revenues increased to $8.832 billion compared to $8.44 billion in the first quarter of 2013. Net income totalled $347 million or $0.76 per diluted share compared to $344 million or $0.74 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding gains from the sale of facilities and legal claim costs incurred during the quarter, the company would have reported net income per diluted share of $0.84 in the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.644 billion increased 4.8% in the first quarter of this year over the first quarter of 2013. If you exclude the impact of EHR incentive income and share based compensation expense from both periods, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 6.3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.6% was flat compared to the prior year. However if you exclude EHR incentive income and share based compensation expense from the adjusted EBITDA for both periods, adjusted EBITDA margin would have increased 30 basis points. Volume trends were somewhat soft in the quarter, primarily in our lower acuity service line. In-patient surgical growth along a decrease in lower acuity patients resulted in growth in case mix index of 2.2%. Net revenue per equivalent machine [ph] was favourably impacted as a result and overall expenses were well managed throughout the quarter. Today we are also reaffirming our previous adjusted EBITDA guidance range of 6.6 billion to 6.85 billion for 2014. And while we are not providing quarterly earnings guidance, I do want to remind everyone that our EBITDA performance in the first half of last year was somewhat uneven. As you may recall, our EBITDA growth in the first quarter of 2013 was below our expectation due to an unfavourable calendar and very soft volumes in the latter part of the quarter. Then in the second quarter, the combination of improved volumes and cost structure resulted in a very strong quarter getting us back on plan by midyear. So for 2014, we’ve had an easier comparison in the first quarter and we will have a much tougher comparison in the second quarter. In addition to our solid financial performance, our patient safety and quality of care agenda continue to perform at a very high level. For example, our reduced Mercer study conducted at 43 HCA hospitals and 74 intensive care units and involved approximately 75,000 patients determined that treating all patients with an antiseptic wash and nasal ointment on admission to intensive care not only reduced all infections by 44% but was selected by the Clinical Research Foundation as one of the top 3 contributions in the US in 2013. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill.
William Rutherford: Hey, great, thank you, Milton and good morning everybody. I will cover some additional detail around the first quarter, then I will turn over to Sam and he will provide some additional commentary on volume and market share information. As Milton mentioned, we were pleased with the quarter’s results. The first quarter results were driven by solid revenue growth resulting from relatively stable volume and increase intensity of services as well as strong expense management by our operators. Milton just mentioned our adjusted EBITDA increased $1.644 billion or an increase of 4.8% from the prior year. However adjusting for the reduction in HITECH incentive income and the increase in share base comp, adjusted EBITDA increased 6.3% over the prior year. In the first quarter, our same facility total admissions declined 0.6% over prior year and equivalent admissions declined 0.3%. We experienced a 140 basis point reduction in our admissions in the quarter due to declines in pulmonary and one day stays. Adjusting for declines in pulmonary and one day stays, same store admissions grew 0.8%. During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions declined 1.1% and 0.3% respectively. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare and managed Medicare admissions increased 2% on the same facility basis and represent just under 30% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.4% and 2.4% respectively in the first quarter when compared to the prior year. This increase compares to fourth quarter declines of 1.6% in both admissions and adjusted admissions, and this was primarily driven by growth in our four Medicaid expansion states that I will speak to shortly. Same facility self-pay and charity admissions increased 2.1% in the quarter while equivalent admissions declined 0.7%. This represented 7.6% of our total admissions compared to 7.4% last year. These results do compare favourably to our fourth quarter 2013 when self-pay and charity admissions and adjusted admissions grew 8.3% and 5.2% respectively. Managed Care and exchange admissions and equivalent admissions declined 1.7% and 2.2% respectively in the first quarter on a same facility basis. And we are combining these two categories until exchange becomes more material. Same facility emergency room visits were basically unchanged compared to the prior year's first quarter. Self-pay and charity ER visits represent 22.3% compared to 22.4% in the last year's first quarter on a same-facility basis. Fairly consistent with prior quarters our softer volume was mostly in our lower acuity business and this coupled with continued in-patient surgical growth helped drive stronger revenue intensity. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission in the quarter increased 3.7% compared to the prior year. Same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission increased 0.8% in the first quarter, while case mix increased 1.7%. Same facility managed care revenue per equivalent admission increased 6.1%, fairly consistent with our prior trends. And case mix increased 2.9% in the quarter. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $347 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Of this same facility charity care discounts totalled $921 million in the first quarter and increased to $17 million from prior year, while same facility uninsured discounts totalled $2.277 billion, an increase of $330 million from the first quarter of 2013. Now let me turn to expenses. Expense management in the quarter remained strong consistent with our recent trends. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 3.2%, reflecting increased acuity and surgical volume in our patient population. As you see on a reported basis, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved to 45.9% from 46.4% in last year's first quarter. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.2% on a same facility basis in the quarter. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 3.1% in the quarter when compared to the prior year and this primarily reflects the service intensity and increased in-patient surgical volume in the quarter. Other operating expenses increased to 18.6% of revenues in the quarter compared to 18.1% last year, primarily reflecting an increase in insurance utilities and other operating. We recognized $30 million in electronic health record income for the first quarter compared to $39 million last year. The company also incurred approximately $43 million in EHR related expenses in the quarter compared to $26 million in last year's first quarter, a $26 million drag on first quarter results, somewhat higher than the previous quarters. Let me take a moment to address cash flow in the quarter. Our cash flow from operations declined from $740 million in Q1 of 2013 to $443 million in Q1 of 2014. This decline's primarily related to $170 million effect increase on working capital and a $206 million negative impact related to income taxes. Last year we received a $185 million tax refund and this year we had a $32 million tax payment. On working capital there were two items affecting this. We had an increase in other current assets primarily to a growth in an imaging [ph] program receivable and a growth in patient receivables. That's mostly attributable to a growth in our governmental receivables, mainly due to a changing regulatory environment which extending the collection process and we had some growth in receivables in our Texas waiver program as the state has had some backlogs in processing payments. In addition you will see we invested $400 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. At March 31st, the company's ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.35x compared to 4.32x at December 31st of 2013. At the end of the quarter the company had approximately $4.442 billion of availability under its revolving credit facilities, however on April 2nd, the company paid $2.9 billion to redeem its $1.5 billion, 8.5%, and $1.25 billion of our 7 and 7/8% notes. You will note a nearly high cash balance on our balance sheet as of March 31st, and this was due to a bond restructuring awaiting to apply to our call provision executed on April 2nd. Now let me move into a discussion around health reform. As Milton mentioned we saw encouraging signs related to health reform in the first quarter. When we think about health reform, we will discuss the impact from two views. First, what we experience with exchange volume and activity and secondly what we experience in our Medicaid expansion states. As I begin, let me preface these comments that although we did see encouraging signs that I will share with you, as we estimated reform is still unfolding and had a minimal impact on our results for the quarter. Relative to exchange volume, we saw just over 1700 exchange admissions in the first quarter of 2014. Remember this is on a base of 440,000 admissions for the company, so about 0.4% of our total admissions. We were encouraged with the progression of this volume that we saw throughout the quarter. In general we saw twice the number of exchange admissions in February than we saw in January and we saw twice the exchange volume in March than we did in February. Although only a small portion of these have completed the collection cycle, we do anticipate clearing these at rate similar to commercial accounts. A key question for this exchange volume has been and is how much is this volume is from previously uninsured patients versus previously insured conversion into an exchange product. In an attempt to get some insight into this question we performed an analysis on each of these exchange admissions we saw in the quarter to evaluate had they been seen in an HCA system within the last 12 months, and if so what was the coverage status. We had seen about half of the exchange population previously and one-third of those served were previously uninsured. So far this is the best data point we have in trying to answer this key question for the exchange volume thus far. Now let me turn to a discussion around Medicaid expansion impact. A quick reminder, that we have four of our states expand Medicaid which represent about 13% of our bed capacity. California, Colorado, Kentucky and Nevada, in our expansion states we saw Medicaid admission growth of 22.3%, as compared to a 1.3% decline in Medicaid admissions in our non-expansion states. Conversely, we saw a 29% decline in uninsured admissions in these four states as compared to a 5.9% growth in uninsured volume in non-expansion states. We estimate the impact from these trends in our expansion states is just over 1000 admissions previously uninsured now have Medicaid coverage. In summary, although reform is still unfolding and still a small percentage of our business, we are encouraged by these early trends and we re-affirm our earlier guidance of health reform impact of 1% to 2% of adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2014. That concludes my remarks and I'll turn it over the call to Sam for some additional comments.
Sam Hazen:  All right, thank you, Bill, good morning. I'll begin my comments this morning with more detail on our same facilities volume for the quarter and then provide an update on market share trends for the company. As you heard pulmonary related admissions were down 9% or almost 4000 admissions as compared to the first quarter of last year. This decline was similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2013 and reflects the soft flu season across the last two quarters. We saw the same decline in our emergency rooms. Pulmonary related emergency room volume was down 9% or approximately 23,000 visits in the quarter. In total, emergency room visits were mostly flat with prior year. However adjusted for pulmonary related volume, emergency room visits grew by 1.3%. In-patient surgeries were up 0.9%. This increase was primarily driven by solid growth in the following areas: orthopaedics, general surgery, cardiovascular and transplant surgery. Out-patient surgery volumes were down 1.7% in total. Hospital based out-patient surgeries were down 1.3% and inside our ambulatory surgery division, out-patient surgeries were down 2.2%. Out-patient endoscopic and pain management procedures which are not included in our surgery statistics increased 5% for the quarter. Other in-patient volume statistics for the company were as follows: obstetric admissions were up 2.1% as part of this growth, managed care of obstetric admissions were up 4%. Behavioural Health admissions grew by 2.4% and rehabilitation admissions grew by 7% and finally average length of stay for in-patient admissions increased 0.9%, reflecting the stronger acuity. Now let me transition to some market share highlights for the 12 months ended September 2013. Once again this data is the most current data available for the company and it represents approximately 90% of the company's markets. The company's in-patient market share for this period grew 31 basis points to 24.1%. HCA gained share in 25 out of 37 markets with gains in 8 of our top 10 markets. We gained share in 12 out of 17 service lines and market share in the commercial segment was flat and also in the in-migration segment we actually increased by 31 basis points. Overall during this period in-patient demand across HCA markets was essentially flat. However in three of the four quarters in this period demand actually increased, but this growth was entirely offset by the soft demand in the first quarter of 2013. Across all of these market share metrics the company's trends are generally consistent with past periods. We believe this performance reflects both solid execution of our growth and operating agendas by our management team and increased capital investments in capacity, technology and new facilities. And with that I'll turn the call back to Vic.
Victor Campbell: All right, Sam, thank you. Travis you want to come back on and queue up for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question today from Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital: 
Operator: Being as there is no response, we'll move onto our next question. Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets
Frank Morgan – RBC Capital Markets:  Good morning. I was hoping if you could give us a little bit of color on the progression of volumes in the quarter and really in the first quarter and really how your stat going into the second quarter given this volatility that you called out. And then secondly, I know Milton had commented in the past that he would never use weather as an excuse. I'm just curious what was the weather impact in the quarter? Thank you.
Victor Campbell:  Milton, you want to do weather and do you want Sam to answer that.
Milton Johnson: Yeah, Frank, we're going to stand by my earlier statement. We don't believe, we didn't see, you know weather of course did hit some of the timing of some of our services in certain markets in the quarter, but we believe the timing of the weather issues were such in the quarter that we were able to largely recover, no material identifiable impact from weather in our first quarter.
Victor Campbell: Sam, you want to talk about the progression in the quarter.
Sam Hazen: The admission growth for the company was primarily in February and March. We actually were up in both of those two months. As the quarter progressed all of our pressure points were in the month of January, which was when we compared against the flu volume from last year. And so if you look at the last two months we did have admission growth and adjusted admission growth as the quarter progressed.
Frank Morgan – RBC Capital Markets: All right, thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo – Robert Baird:  Hey thanks, maybe just one for Bill or one now that you guys have a better glimpse at a lot of the enrolment data in your markets recognizing that it's a small piece right now. But any unique observations that you think are worth making and my second question would just be around the conversation around premium subsidies and I'm not sure if HCA has just really stated their position at this point. So just any comments there will be helpful.
William Rutherford:  Well I can't call out any distinct characteristics with this exchange volume so far in the first quarter. You know it is still early. As I mentioned in my comments we're pleased with the progression of that volume we saw in the first quarter, seems to be fairly even spread among a majority of our states. Really no differentiating characteristics of that exchange volume compared to our other book of business at this stage, so nothing really to call out right now.
Milton Johnson:  And on the premium subsidy, I think there we have, we have not really pursued that.
William Rutherford: Yeah, our position is when we have not pursued premium subsidies in a large scale way. We may still reserve the opportunity to do that on a case by case basis. But for the most part we're not pursuing a strategy around premium subsidies.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank:  Thanks, good morning everybody. You know I just wanted to follow-up with regard to some of your comments Bill, about the growth in the indigent receivables and I just want to make sure that I understand what really that reflects, and if you could also please remind us what the Medicaid pending policy is for HCA, it would seem that even though you don't have a lot of Medicaid expansion exposure, there has been a decent amount of wood work effect. So curious if that's tying up any receivables and how you think that might play out into the next couple of quarters.
William Rutherford: In my comments around working capital and cash flow we attributed to a couple of items and I did reference in indigent program receivable. That’s in one of our states where we make contributions to a fund and then we receive indigent payments back out. It’s just timing differences and we don’t think that’s really a material factor. We did have a growth in government receivables mainly just through increased complexity of that collection cycle with regulatory environment and we think that will eventually find its course. Relative to pending Medicaid, we have kept our pending Medicaid policies consistent as uninsured patients come to our facilities, we screen them for pending Medicaid eligibility, and once they get accepted within that Medicaid program, that account is treated as a Medicaid account. They don't get accepted, we then move them through our charity and uninsured discount program and our policies around that have remained consistent.
Sam Hazen: Yes. As you may know, we look at our prior right off history and use that as the basis for our estimates going forward.
Operator: We will take our next question from Gary Taylor with Citi.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Just had a question going back to your thoughts on the HCA and I certainly heard what you said about the trends and how you feel about it going forward. When you guys gave your guidance for the year, I think nationally you maybe 1.8 million people had signed up for exchanges and now of course we know the number is 8 million or more than 8 million. Still some question as to what percentage of those were previously uninsured, but I just wondered how much that substantial acceleration enrollment has impacted how you're thinking about the go forward particularly in states like Texas and Florida where exchange enrollment has picked up pretty significantly.
Milton Johnson: Yes, Gary when we ran our models we had – actually the data was more current than 1.8 million, that was probably around 3 million or so when we had projections that it would go higher up. So our assumption was not the 8 million people to be enrolled in this first year. That's a little higher than we thought. And we will see how that plays out in the rest of the year. But again, what we saw here in the first quarter and as Bill said and I will say again, it's too early to take a lot out of the first quarter as an indication of health care reform for the rest of the year and I said on the call last quarter that we probably wouldn't be able to provide a lot or thought about reform until at least the middle of the year when we release second quarter. I think we still reserve that position. With that being said, the 8 million enrolled is more than we thought in our model, but how we thought about reform and the potential impact it would have in the first quarter, the actual results are fairly consistent with what we expected.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital: We had a little medical urgency on this end. I apologize for missing my queue at first. Can you comment on the way you approach the accounting for Medicaid pending and whether it’s different with some of the commentary referred, for example, from light point about how they do it? And also can you comment about your expectations for acquisition strategy for this year and the coming years? Thanks.
Victor Campbell: Bill, you want to do the…
William Rutherford:  Yeah. Sure. All of yours pending Medicaid moment you want on the acquisition. Sure, we did talk about it briefly. Our policies around pending Medicaid have not changed. It’s consistent with the way we’ve operated that for several years as patients come into our facilities of unsure, we put them on pending Medicaid status and go through an eligibility review screening. When that individual gets accepted into that state’s Medicaid program we would then convert them out of pending Medicaid into Medicaid and told them they attract this pending Medicaid. If they don’t get involved in a Medicaid, they may move through our charity and on into our discount policy. So, no change in how we treat those. Our accounting methodology is to reserve for that pending Medicaid based on our historical experience and again we’ve had no material changes in how we approach that segment of our business.
Victor Campbell:  Bill, if you want to add a bit.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital: You don’t account for the self-pay in the current reported revenues but rather as Medicaid but reduce in terms of less than 100% of what you expect to get up there approved as a member.
William Rutherford:  Yeah. If the pending Medicaid attracts in self-pay until which time they get accepted in the Medicaid, so the pending Medicaid is attracting a self-pay. We do not classify them as Medicaid until they’re accepted as a Medicaid alone for that state. So, in this interim revenue period they’re attracting a self-pay receivables into self-pay revenues for us.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital:  That’s important thing. Thank you.
William Rutherford:  Okay. Sheryl relative to acquisition strategy remains consistent while we’ve been the last really few years. So I would say many times we would like to be able to grow through more meaningful acquisitions if we can find those opportunities that set our strategy in terms of what the market complexion will look like and our belief of how we could drive shareholder value through those acquisitions. So, that hasn’t changed. If you look over the last few years, our acquisitions have been largely what I called “tuck-in acquisitions.” Those have been successful acquisitions for the company, we’ll continue to pursue that. But given the opportunity to make a more material acquisition in the market, we would look at those opportunities and we do look at those opportunities. Some of the larger transactions that have occurred in last couple of years have largely been raw sort of facilities and really didn’t fit the sort of markets that we looked for. So, those we did not pursue obviously. But I would say it’s a consistent acquisition strategy. We continue to look for opportunities and hope for that we’ll be able to find opportunities to grow inorganic growth through acquisitions that are we have pricing discipline but will also result in creating shareholder value.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital:  Thank you. So…
Victor Campbell:  Thank you, Sheryl. I’m sorry.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital: Yeah. Okay, if I could just follow up on that. When you did Kansas City it was slightly accretive to the first year. I recognize the things in history because it was over 10 years ago, but it was slightly dilutive to the first year but heavily accretive after that, a very important acquisition. Would you consider doing something like that again if that meant meaningful step-up in the company’s growth profile?
Milton Johnson:  We would – I think Sheryl that many times when we see acquisitions coming of not for profit sector, not always, but sometimes can be assets that are challenged. That was the case in Kansas City. And so it was a turnaround situation that’s been almost I guess now 14-13 years ago and it was a successful turnaround for us, but we knew that we will walk into a turnaround situation. There could be acquisitions, though that we could see a not for profit sector where it could be a motivation to look for strategic opportunities in the market not because of financial issues but because of the changing market place and these institutions could see the advantage as a being part of a large organization. I get to see what we could bring to the table, and we’re hoping we will find more those opportunities as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Lake with JP Morgan.
Justin Lake – JP Morgan: Thanks. Good morning. I had a couple of questions just on Medicaid expansion. First, when your peers give an estimate that 80% of their uninsured volumes come from people who are Medicaid eligible, do you have an estimate here for HCA? And then what are your typical approval trends on Medicaid admissions? And has that changed post the implementation of presumed eligibility? Thanks.
Victor Campbell:  Bill. Sounds like you..
William Rutherford: Yeah. Justin. Hi, good morning. I honestly don’t have a strong percentage for you on our uninsured that’s Medicaid eligible. My instinct says it’s a higher percentage, but I can quote a percentage for you. We are seeing in our expansion states as we mentioned some really higher that shifts that may re-anticipate in terms of the uninsured to Medicaid so that may support it. It’s a higher percent, but I can’t throw out a percent for you at this point in time relative to the impact on Medicaid conversions. So, when I walk through pending Medicaid and when we go through the screening then that individuals determine to be qualified for that state’s Medicaid. We got a very high percentage of converting them into Medicaid north of the 80% are. When you don’t, it’s generally issues where just obtaining signatures and application process; so very, very high. Too early to call changes in that with our 4-expansion states. We have seen a growth in our pending Medicaid in those states, which I.V. [ph] was a positive sign as we have more people in the queue. We do have some increased success rate of converting those in this first quarter, and I think we’ll need another quarter or so for that to settle out as we have not only the existing inventory going through pending Medicaid but new service states since January on there. So, we’re all optimistic we’ll see that conversion go even higher in our expansion stage.
Victor Campbell: Thank you, Justin.
Justin Lake – JP Morgan: Thanks.
Operator:  Our next questions comes from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker – Morgan Stanley:  Hi, good morning. I’m just curious are you seeing any trends of -- exchange members showing up at ERs? And if you are a kind of rates you’re collecting from managed care for this client? Thanks.
William Rutherford:  Yeah. Good morning. The majority of our exchange volume is in network. We do have some out at network and when we do have that out at network it is showing up an EV, but the majority of the exchange volume is in network and it’s too early to call kind of the adjudication rates on either one of -- out of network population.
Victor Campbell: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Jason Gurda with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jason Gurda – KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Hi, good morning. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about what you’re seeing as far as narrow network contracting what sort of changes year-over-year then also managed care plans in use of tiered hospital networks?
Victor Campbell: Right. Sam, you want to lead with that?
Sam Hazen:  Most of the narrow networks are contracts that are visible inside the markets are related to exchange products and exchange products only. 88 participate in about 99% of all commercial contracts across all 42 markets that are participates in and we’ve participated in our governmental Medicare advantage or managed Medicaid products. Generally speaking, we’re not seeing any kind of changes in our contracting configuration with the payors in the cycle that we’re in today and that cycle includes 2014 and 2015 where we have all the revenue for the most part in 2014 contracted at about 70% of our 2015 revenue contracted at similar terms and trends. 2016 is about a third done and again it’s very similar to what we have seen in the earlier part of its cycle. So, no material changes other than we’ve experienced in the past and the only new dynamic is within the exchanges. Jason, thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Barclays
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:  Hi. Thanks and good morning. Thank you for taking the call. On just want to make sure I understand the admission numbers that you’d talked about with respect to Medicaid, I think you said 22.3% growth in Medicaid in your expansion state with the corresponding decline in uninsured of 29%. So within that does that include Medicaid pendings or if the Medicaid pendings actually do come through then the growth in cat would be higher and uninsured would be lower? Or is there some estimate at that a conversion rate of those…?
Sam Hazen:  No. There’s no estimate. The Medicaid would only include those that are actually enrolled in Medicaid and pending Medicaid would be still treated as uninsured. So, there’s no estimate of conversion in pending Medicaid, and I’ll report that the Medicaid admissions in those expansions they show all four individuals that were actually enrolled in Medicaid to the extent they’re still pursuing enrolment, we’re going to the application, those are treated as uninsured in our accounting. So, the odds are overtime that…
William Rutherford: And as I said we’re seeing some increased balances in our pending Medicaid in those conversion states. So, we’re optimistic that we’ll see more come out of that in the future. Good?
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital:  Right. And is there a way to size the pending Medicaid bucket right now in terms of the total percentage of admits in those states?
William Rutherford: No. It’s still too early to be able to kind of size what we think that changes in our historical experience will be.
Operator:
.: 
Joanna Gajuk – Bank of America, Merrill Lynch:  Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Actually this is Joanna Gajuk in for Kevin today. Thanks a lot for the call in terms of the reform, but I want to just come back quickly on the volume performance in the quarter, which did improve and you guys did find to keep – don’t want to blame weather. You said you expect or you did – the volumes came back to you, but previously you were also talking about impact of 2-Midnight Rules. So, can you talk about that whether there was any impact this quarter and how this compare to Q4 and then going forward and also your fear how sort of company talk about that’s improving economy benefits in the quarter on the while? So, any color you might give on those? I do appreciate. Thanks.
William Rutherford:  Yeah. I would try to address pieces of that as the 2-Midnight Rule and we mentioned that in the fourth quarter. We’re still implementing the 2-Midnight Rule and dedicating a lot of resources towards that effort. As mentioned in our commentary, we are experiencing softness of one day stays among all payor classes. And we did have a decline in Medicare 1 stays for the quarter. It’s not as pronounced as we had in the first quarter. We still have many.. In the fourth quarter. Sorry. Then I said last year. So, we did have an impact in the first quarter, but it was not pronounced as we had in the fourth quarter of ’13. We still have accounts going through the review process. We’re working with our external reviewers on probe reviews that are going still refining processes on that. And so we’ll still have our ongoing implementation efforts. We do think it will continue to impact some of our admission statistics going forward but does not have a material financial impact on us as we’ve spoken about before because we’ve been able to eliminate some outside revenue of this and Sam’s going to address the economic side of it.
Sam Hazen:  Yeah. I don’t know. But I have a metric per se that indicates a composite view of the company’s economies but I’ll say that in general the unemployment rates across HCA markets is better than the unemployment rate at the nation as a whole. It’s trending favorably also. And then if I would put a proxy [ph] on a particular measure that suggests possible improvement, it would be the managed care delivery for the company, about 4% in the first quarter. And that’s a positive indicator of my opinion about the economy across HCA markets and what it might portend as we move forward.
Victor Campbell:  Good. Thank you, Joanna
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Gimmerman with [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst:  Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just as a follow-up to the acquisition question, can you give us an update on how you’re viewing the possibility of further international expansion? And then can you give us an update on the amount of target in repurchases at this point? It looks like you’ve taken measures in last quarter in terms of refinancing to ease the ability to buy back. So, just a general update on your appetite for a larger purchase.
Victor Campbell: Bill, that sounds like one for you.
William Rutherford:  You know as far as acquisition opportunists internationally we’ve done our assessment of international markets, which markets do we find to be attractive in the event of… We see any opportunity. We did have that across the U.S. markets as well. So, we obviously operate in the U.K. in London very successful market for us. So, we have some experience there. But other than that, there is really nothing more thing to add to how we do to international markets. It’s we access it much like we do in the U.S. markets. With respect to the – I think referring to restricted payments basket, the restructuring that we went through are debt structuring deed, increase of restricted payments basket.
Victor Campbell:  And do you want…?
William Rutherford: Yeah. Right now before we talk our plans we have just about $1 billion of capacity under the restricted balance, restricted payments basket and it will increase once we follow first quarter compliance by a couple $100 million.
Unidentified Analyst:  Alright. Thanks a lot.
William Rutherford: Okay.
Operator: 
 :
Victor Campbell:  Hi Chris.
Chris Rigg – Susquehanna International Group.: Good morning, guys. Just wanted to better understand the comments around the comparisons getting more difficult in Q2 or just the latter part of the area. Is that just volumes or you’re saying year-to-year growth in EBITDA and EPS as well.
William Rutherford: Well. What I was referring to as we went through the last year we had a really solid performance in the second quarter. And actually if you look back at 2013 in the second quarter, we had the highest admission growth of the year in the second quarter. So it will be a difficult comp I think relative to the growth in volume and in turn, that will also to a difficult comp in the first quarter is what I'm trying to say then as well. So I just wanted to point that out to the market. If you look at our guidance for the year in the first quarter, our growth rate exceeded our guidance for the year and I just wanted to point out that as we think about the second quarter and our performance in the second quarter of last year, that needs to be considered as you're looking at the growth rate. So obviously our guidance does not project that the growth rate we produced in the first quarter will continue throughout the rest of the year. That's the point really I was trying to make.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Thanks. Good morning. Can you maybe give us any early read on success you may have had on getting insured covered via the exchange maybe how aggressive you were there? And is there any way to think about sort of a potential kind of pending bucket for that category in terms of kind of coming back into the facility frequent flyers, et cetera.
William Rutherford: So as we spoke about in fourth quarter, we made attempts on outreach to our insured both our certified application account for us in our facilities about 400 of them making contact, we also in early in this quarter, we made outbound kind of contact to what we view the people who have visited our system frequently over the past 12 months. And I would say the result of that on this was fairly marginal, it was more of an education and awareness campaign as much as anything versus how to track the exact number of sign ups or applications that generated. But we are fairly active in that but in terms of the yielded result hard to track exactly in terms of how much, how many exchange enrollments that resulted in, it was more of a community education and awareness effort.
Operator: Our next question comes from HA Rice with UBS.
Unidentified Analyst: Just two quick things. First of all, I guess we’ve got an IPAPS update coming and you are rolling of a sequestration, can you remind us how much you benefit, how much the sequestration is a quarterly drag for you has been and do you have any views on the IPAPS proposals coming out and then – is there any update on some of the initiatives in parallel [ph]?
Milton Johnson: On the sequestration hit in the quarter, I think it’s about 35 million to 40 million drag for us year over year. Of course that normalizes out and we did that sequestration drag of course in our plan but that’s the dollar amount of the drag.
Victor Campbell: Yes, we are sitting there just like you, we expect it one day this week and really can’t anticipate what’s going to include, we’re not getting any signals of surprises but time will tell.
William Rutherford: This is Bill on Parallon, I think we are on plan with Parallon growth, continue to focus with the implementation of the LifePoint account as we have heard about, we got our Catholic Healthcare Partners implementation going on as we speak and so far Parallon is on plan with our expectation. Our health thrust purchasing group inside Parallon is performing very well as well.
Operator: We will take our next question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo: Thanks. I guess one clarification. Just to be clear based on the analysis that you had done of the exchange based patients, so two thirds of the exchange individuals have not been previously insured, is that the takeaway from that?
William Rutherford: No. It was the opposite. So we look at our exchange volume, went back 12 month and said how we’d seen them before, and we have seen about half of that volume previously. And of that half, one third was previously uninsured, two thirds had some previous coverage. So that number was one third at least of that data point previously had no coverage, but to date they are enrolled in exchange product.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo: So was that in line with your expectations or was that surprising to you?
William Rutherford: It’s pretty close to what our expectations were. I think as we spoke in our earlier call, that was a variable that was floating around as we were completing our model about how much of your exchange volume that you projected will be incremental or not and there were numbers all over from 11% to 50% and we say kind of our numbers were in the middle of that. So that’s really consistent with what our model expectations would be.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo: And just on sort of the progression of the rate of increase of the impact from the exchanges sort of the doubling in February and March, do you expect that kind of rate of increase to continue through say mid May when the impact of those that were signing up on the exchanges had sort of – how would you think about that?
William Rutherford: We are hopeful but my honest answer is we just don’t know yet, so we are continuing to watch that, we think there will be some progression of that, will it be at the same pace we saw in the first couple of months, really I just don’t know, it would be great if it was but we just don’t know yet.
Operator: Our final question today comes from Collin Lange [ph] with FBR Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst: Just a quick one following up on a few earlier questions. Are you still comfortable with 1% to 2% equivalent admission growth for the year given the comps do get a bit more difficult in Q2 and Q3?
Milton Johnson: We are starting here just at admissions that down 0.3 here for the first quarter. I wouldn’t take 1% growth off the table yet but so I would say still one to two would be our best guidance based on one quarter.
Victor Campbell: All right. Thank you, Collin, thank everyone for participating on the call. And Mark is here all day and I will be here part of the day.
Operator: That concludes today’s presentation. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings and Year End Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead.
Victor L. Campbell: Casey, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call, including those of you listening to the webcast. With me here this morning are President and CEO, Milton Johnson; our CFO, Executive VP, Bill Rutherford, his maiden voyage for the call, and welcome, Bill; Sam Hazen, our President of Operations; and several other members of HCA's senior management team are here as well. Before I turn the call over to Milton, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. This morning's call is being recorded. As you heard, a replay will be available later today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson: Thanks, Vic. And good morning to everyone joining us on our call this morning. Let me start by welcoming Bill Rutherford to the earnings call. As most of you know, Bill was named Chief Financial Officer effective January 1 and you'll hear from Bill later this morning. I will start today by providing a few general thoughts on our fourth quarter performance, as well as some observations for the entire year. And then, following this, I have a few comments on health care reform, as well as 2014 guidance. First, the fourth quarter. We were very pleased with our overall performance for the quarter. Due to the exceptional volume we experienced in last year's fourth quarter and the implementation of the 2-Midnight Rule in the fourth quarter of this year, we expected softer volume growth rates in the quarter. We were able to deliver EBITDA growth in excess of our internal expectations due to better than expected service mix that resulted in higher revenue rate per equivalent admission. This, along with solid performance in managing expenses in the quarter, resulted in adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.7%. Much of my commentary for the quarter can be said for the year. The year 2013 was a year that we experienced softer volume growth trends compared to recent years for HCA. Softer volume trends were offset by higher acuity patients and focused expense management. Our operating team has done an excellent job of making appropriate adjustments to our cost structure to reflect the change in volume trends. Adjusted EBITDA for 2013 of $6.574 billion increased 0.7% over 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $6.531 billion on a reported basis. However, adjusting for the $170 million net favorable Medicare settlement and recorded in the first quarter of 2012 and $120 million last HITECH incentive income in 2013 and an increase in noncash share-based compensation expense in 2013 of $57 million, adjusted EBITDA growth in 2013 would have increased by an additional 570 basis points. In addition to our financial success in 2013, I want to highlight our continuing clinical quality improvement as well. HCA's aggregate performance on CMS core measures is above the 90th percentile. 110 HCA hospitals or 80% were recognized in 2013 by Joint Commission as top performers versus 33% of U.S. hospitals. And in 2014, we will continue to build our programs in patient safety, infection prevention and the use of electronic health records and clinical data for the highest quality and most efficient health care. Before moving to 2014 guidance, I have a few general thoughts to share. I believe we are well positioned in our key markets as we start 2014. Our operating agendas are structured appropriately. They are focused and they are effective. Operationally, we are focused on patient volume growth, quality outcomes, improving patient service and efficiency in service delivery. We believe these are the key ingredients for success. In a moment, Bill will provide details on our 2014 guidance, including health care reform. But first, I will provide a few thoughts. In this morning's earnings release, we provided guidance estimates for certain financial metrics, including the expected financial impact from the Affordable Care Act. Our adjusted EBITDA range is $6.6 billion to $6.85 billion for 2014. Included in our adjusted EBITDA guidance is a benefit from the Affordable Care Act in the range of 1% to 2% of adjusted EBITDA. Let me make a few comments about our guidance for health care reform. Number one, many of us at HCA have worked diligently over many months in an attempt to model the adjusted EBITDA impact of health care reform for 2014 and beyond. Number two, which should come as no surprise, there continues to be many uncertainties for the key variables which will drive the financial impact of reform. Number three, the Medicare rate reductions we have been incurring since 2010 and that we will continue to incur as reform pay-fors are built into our core business run rate and are not included in the calculation of our 1% to 2% benefit range. And finally, let me just say that while I'd always hoped we could provide annual reform guidance for multiple years, there remained too many uncertainties for many of the key variables to do so. However, we remain optimistic that reform should contribute to additional growth rate for HCA over the longer term. And as we reflect upon all this, we believe we are well positioned to succeed in the health care reform environment. Before turning the call over to Bill, as you may know, yesterday, we announced the appointment of 3 new independent directors to our board. Also, as a result of the company's transition from a controlled company, 2 directors from each of our private equity sponsors stepped down from the board, leaving one director from each firm on the board. This transition is the result of the reduction in share ownership by our sponsors that occurred in 2013. I am looking forward to working with our new independent directors, as well as existing board members in the years ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional details regarding the fourth quarter and 2013.
William B. Rutherford: Thank you, Milton, and good morning, everybody. I will cover some additional detail around the fourth quarter results, then I'll turn it over to Sam and he will provide commentary on our growth agenda and some market share information. I'll then come back and conclude with some remarks on our approach to health reform modeling and some additional detail on our 2014 guidance. As Milton mentioned, we were very pleased with the quarter's results, especially given the strength of last year's fourth quarter. The fourth quarter results were driven by solid revenue growth, resulting from relatively stable volume trends and increased intensity of service, as well as excellent expense management by our operators. Revenues in the fourth quarter increased 4.8% to $8.836 billion, driven primarily by revenue per equivalent admission growth of 4.6%. Case mix, or the level of acuity of patients served in our facilities, increased 3% in the quarter compared to the prior year. We saw solid surgical volume in the quarter, while also seeing a reduction in lower acuity cases, such as pulmonary. And Sam will share some additional details on this. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.714 billion, an increase of 6.7% from the prior year. EBITDA margin increased 40 basis points to 19.4%. Volume trends in the quarter were below our recent trends. However, this was not surprising given the strength of last year's fourth quarter where same facility admissions grew 4.3% and equivalent admissions grew 5%. So this quarter did provide a difficult comp. In the fourth quarter of this year, our same facility total admissions declined 1.8% over prior year and equivalent admissions declined 1%. During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions declined 2.4% and 0.9%, respectively. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 4.4% on a same facility basis and now represent 29.5% of our total Medicare admissions. Let me take a moment here to comment on the 2-Midnight Rule. As you would expect, we have spent a considerable amount of time and effort on the implementation of this new rule, which became effective October 1, 2013. In addition to a significant amount of training, education and process redesign, we've implemented a new Medicare order form, worked diligently with our physicians and implemented tracking and monitoring processes. This new rule did have an impact on our reported Medicare and total admissions for the quarter. Our decline in Medicare 1-day stays accounted for about 50 basis points of our total admission decline for the quarter. We'll continue to implement and monitor the impact of this new rule. And while it did and will likely continue to have an impact on our reported admission metrics, we do not believe it will have a material financial impact, as we were also able to eliminate some operating expenses associated with outside reviewer costs that have previously been incurred related to reviewing our short stay Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions and equivalent admissions declined 1.6% in the fourth quarter when compared to the prior year. Managed care admissions and equivalent admissions declined 3.8% and 3%, respectively, in the quarter on a same facility basis. And same facility emergency room visits declined 2.4% in the quarter. This was also against a difficult comp, as emergency room visits increased 12.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Our softer volume was mostly in our lower acuity business. And this, coupled with continued surgical growth, helped drive stronger revenue intensity. Same facility revenue per equivalent admissions in the quarter increased a solid 4.8% compared to the prior year. Same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission increased 1.3% in the fourth quarter, while Medicare case mix increased 3.3%. Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission declined 0.6%, excluding the Medicaid waiver programs, while case mix increased 3.1% over the prior year. And same facility managed and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 7.7 -- 7.1%, a slight increase from our year-to-date trends. Case mix increased 3.6% in the quarter. And same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $498 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Of this, same facility charity care discounts totaled $916 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $165 million from the prior year. While same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.139 billion, an increase of $333 million from the fourth quarter of 2012. Now turning to expenses. Expense management in the quarter remained strong, consistent with our previous quarters in 2013. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 3.5%, reflecting increased acuity and surgical volume in our patient population. As you see on a reported basis, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue improved to 44.9% from 45.8% in the fourth quarter of last year. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.5% on a same facility basis in the quarter. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 4.5% in the quarter when compared to last year. This primarily reflects the service intensity and increased surgical volume we saw in the quarter. We recognized $50 million in electronic health record income in the fourth quarter compared to $80 million last year. The company also incurred approximately $28 million in EHR-related expenses in the quarter compared to $19 million in last year's fourth quarter and both of these are consistent with our expectations. Cash flows from operating activities totaled $1.226 billion compared to $1.263 billion in last year's fourth quarter. We spent $596 million in capital expenditures in the quarter, bringing our full year CapEx spend to $1.943 billion. Days and AR increased slightly to 54 days at the end of the quarter. At December 31, the company's ratio of debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.32x compared to 4.39x at September 30. And at the end of the quarter, the company had approximately $2 billion of availability under its revolving credit facilities. That concludes my remarks in 2013. Now I'll turn it over to Sam for some additional comments.
Samuel N. Hazen: Good morning. I want to provide some detail on both fourth quarter volumes and market share performance for the company. Same facility inpatient admissions in the fourth quarter were down approximately 8,000. Three factors explain this decline. First, pulmonary admissions were down 9%, almost 3,500 admissions. We believe the lighter flu season is the reason. Second, Medicare short stay inpatient admissions, though staying less than 2 midnights, were down 12%, almost 2,500 admissions. And third, we believe the implementation of the CMS 2-Midnight Rule spilled over into other payors as short stay inpatient admissions and other payor categories declined by another 2,100 admissions, or 4%. Outpatient observation visits, the alternative category for many short stay inpatient admissions, increased by almost 11,000, or 8.5%. Pulmonary-related emergency room visits were down in the quarter by over 9%, or approximately 23,000 visits. This decline represents approximately 53% of the overall reduction in emergency room visits. The positive story inside our volume analysis is the increased acuity. As you heard, our case mix index for the quarter was strong. This increase was driven by a number of factors. First, inpatient surgery volume grew by 1%. And as a result, surgical admissions were a larger percentage of total admissions in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year. Secondly, across our surgical business, service lines with higher acuity, such as orthopedics, neurosciences and cardiovascular, grew at a faster rate. And third, within our medical and surgical service lines, the overall acuity was higher within many individual service lines this quarter. We believe declines in short stay admissions explain some of this change. Average length of stay increased by 1.4% in the quarter, reflecting the increased acuity of our inpatient visits. Other inpatient statistics for the company are as follows: obstetric admissions grew by 1%, behavioral services admissions grew by 1.6%, rehabilitation admissions grew by 9%, and census levels inside our intensive care units were slightly up. Same-facility outpatient surgical cases grew 1.6% in the quarter. We saw growth in both our hospital outpatient surgical departments and our ambulatory surgery division. We believe our program to become the O.R. of choice for our physicians and patients is driving this growth and our inpatient surgical growth. In the quarter, 8 out of 14 divisions had growth in inpatient surgical volume and 10 out of 14 divisions had growth in outpatient surgical volumes. Our international division also had solid growth in total surgical volumes. Now let me transition to some market share highlights for the 12 months ended June 2013. Once again, this data is the most current data available for the company and it represents almost 90% of the company's markets. The company's inpatient market share for this period increased by 44 basis points to 23.8%. Inpatient demand in these markets during the 12-month period was essentially flat. For the 3 months ended June 2013, however, inpatient demand increased by 0.3%, which is a rebound from the decline in demand experienced in the first quarter of 2013. We gained share in 13 out of 17 service lines. We gained share in 27 of 37 markets. Our market share in both the commercial and in migration segments of our business continue to grow in this period. Across all these metrics, the company's market share trends are generally consistent with past reports. HCA continues to invest in its growth agenda. As you saw in our press release, we are going to increase capital spending in 2014 to around $2.2 billion, which is approximately $200 million greater than 2013. This increase will go to expanding our operating capacity in existing facilities and to expanding the number of facilities, both inpatient and outpatient, in our existing markets. As part of our capital spending for 2013 and 2014, the company will add approximately 770 new inpatient beds and 270 emergency room beds. Included in these additions are 5 new hospitals, 2 of which have already begun operations; 15 new emergency rooms in outreach markets; and 3 replacement surgery centers. Additionally, we are investing in more technology and organizational resources to improve our quality and service offering, which should make our facilities more competitive and responsive to the needs of our patients and physicians. And with that, let me turn the call back to Bill.
William B. Rutherford: Thank you, Sam. So now let me conclude with the discussion about health reform and some additional commentary on 2014 guidance. As Milton mentioned and I think we all know, much uncertainty remains around health reform. So we want to walk you through the approach we used in developing our guidance range. We remain optimistic on the long-term benefits of health reform. But given the slower-than-expected rollout, discussion around the percentage of enrollment that are newly insured, the reported disruption in the individual and small group marketplace and lack of specific market level enrollment data, our outlook and evaluation of health reform will remain fluid during the year. As mentioned in our release, we are currently estimating a positive impact of health reform on our adjusted EBITDA between 1% and 2%. While there are multiple assumptions around health reform, there are really 4 key variables that drive the majority of our estimated impact. First, are the assumptions around the final enrollment and exchanges and newly covered Medicaid lives due to expansion. We operate in 4 states that elected to expand Medicaid as of this time: California, Nevada, Colorado and Kentucky. So Medicaid expansion has only a moderate impact within our estimate versus the exchange enrollment. On the exchange enrollment, your information is as current as ours. Knowing that there are roughly 2 million people enrolled in exchanges at the end of 2013 and that was updated last week to now just under 3 million enrolled. And our model builds from this base. The second variable to the model is the estimate for the percentage of enrollment that was previously uninsured versus previously insured. I believe we've all read a variety of ranges on this issue over the past couple of weeks and our model makes some broad estimates for this variable. The third variable is our participation in exchange networks, the related revenue clearance of this exchange network volume and assumptions around metal tier selection. Currently, 97% of our facilities participate in exchange product. 64% of our facilities have access to the lowest-priced bronze and 54% have an access to the lowest-priced silver. The last variable relates to assumptions around out-of-network treatment and reimbursement. Over the past several months, our team, with the assistance of outside resources, have performed exhaustive market evaluation, data analysis and updated our market-by-market assumptions on each of these and other variables. It is the product of this work and our updated assumptions that have led to the guidance we're sharing with you today. In summary, our estimate is the net effect of the upside remodel for our share of newly insured individuals, offset by lower revenue clearance for the migration of previously insured moving into an exchange or exchange-like product. The summation of our work can be characterized that we're estimating 7% to 9% of our uninsured business will gain some new coverage. And this will provide a positive benefit in new reimbursement. However, this will be partially offset with some revenue clearance decline from previously insured exchange enrollment. The net effect being an increase in our adjusted EBITDA between 1% and 2%. So to conclude my health reform comments, we know all of this is still unfolding and there remain many unknowns. Clearly, it is important to share with you some insight into how we're thinking about reform. All right. So let's move on to 2014 guidance. As highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we estimated our 2014 consolidated revenues should range from $35.5 billion to $36.5 billion. This does not include the impact from any acquisitions not yet completed. We also expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $6.6 billion and $6.85 billion. Within our revenue estimate, we estimate equivalent admission growth to range from 1% to 2% for the year and revenue per equivalent admission growth to range from 2% to 3% for 2014. Medicare revenues in 2014 reflect the composite growth rate of approximately 1%, factoring the market basket changes, OCA [ph] reduction and the annualizing effect to sequestration. Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission is estimated to be flat year-over-year. And for 2014, we have virtually all of our managed care revenue under contract, with rates averaging between 4.5% and 5.5%. Operating expenses are anticipated to continue to benefit from a continued low inflationary environment in 2014. And our operating expense guidance is built on maintaining margins, while we continued to invest into our clinical and EHR development initiatives. HITECH revenues for 2014 are estimated to range from $110 million to $130 million, a reduction of approximately $100 million from 2013. HITECH expenses should also range from $110 million to $130 million for the year, comparable to last year. 2014 guidance also incorporates the third year of our post-IPO share-based awards and noncash share-based compensation expense, which is expected to increase to approximately $168 million for the year, or an increase of $55 million from 2013. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $1.8 billion. Interest expense is projected to be about $1.8 billion as well. And our effective tax rates will be approximately 38.5%. We're estimating our outstanding share count would average just over 461 million shares. And lastly, our earnings per diluted share guidance for 2014 is $3.45 to $3.75. So with that, I conclude my remarks, turn it over to Vic for some Q&A.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Bill, thank you. Sam and Milton, as well. All right. Casey, you want to come back on? We're going to poll for questions. [Operator Instructions] All yours, Casey.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Obviously, reform is a huge task to model into the business. But I was wondering if you could help us further -- the explanation was great, Bill -- I was wondering if you can help us further. There's still some lingering focus on the provisions for doubtful accounts and either using that as a proxy for how much reform might add, or I think more materially, trying to understand how it's going to change with at least some of your uninsured volumes being covered. Could you walk through your thoughts on that, please, with us? And also any timing that you might be able to help us out with in terms of understanding when you think you might have enough data to update us again on reform?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Who wants that? Bill?
William B. Rutherford: I'll take the first stab and then Milton or Sam add in as necessary. Sheryl, thank you for the question. So we believe by laying out our expectation of 7% to 9% of uninsured gaining some coverage give some insight in how we're thinking about that. We know that will leave 92%, 94% of our current uninsured business that will still flow through on to bad debt. And we know that book has been growing 6% to 8% a year. So maybe hard to see the impact to that on our provision at least on our reported statements. As part of our deduct that we say partially offsets the upside of the uninsured is the conversion of insured into an exchange product. A subset of that population will move into a product that is comparable revenue clearance. There's a subset of that population that will move into exchange product, with perhaps some reduced revenue clearance, either through a discount for participating on exchange product or higher bad debt because of deductible and coinsurance. So that offsets some of that movement on the previously uninsured. And some of that may move into a restricted network. And we'll either see that in an out-of-network position or it be directed around us. So I think it's hard for us to kind of see that exactly show up on our provision of uninsured. There will be some relief with the uninsured gaining coverage. But we'll see some continued growth with the business that remains. And there'll be some offset to that with increased bad debts with the higher deductible and co-pays for exchange-like products. That's my best answer...
Victor L. Campbell: Milton, do you want to add?
R. Milton Johnson: Yes. Allow me to maybe help frame a little bit. If you think about this year, 2013, when you look at our self-pay or uninsured revenue, increased by roughly $100 million over '12. When you look at our provision for doubtful accounts, roughly about 70% of that amount in 2013 was used to reserve for self-pay revenue or uninsured revenue, leaving about 30% for co-pay and deductibles for insured patients. So that kind of maybe helps frame how it's growing most recently coming into reform. When I think about reform as well into 2014, I think it's going to be, the benefits will probably be more back-end loaded. There would be probably some small benefit we'll see in the first quarter, growing maybe into the second. But really, we see it as more a third and fourth quarter opportunity for us, quite frankly. So as you think about modeling that 1% to 2%, I see it more of a back-end loaded number for us rather than early here in 2014. And as far as when we think we'll have more clarity about some of these variables, at the very earliest, and this again is the earliest that I would expect and I'm not sure we'll have it then, is midyear. So when we give our -- into the -- in the third quarter of '14, where we're giving second quarter earnings analysis, we might have some more clarity around some of these variables as we see the first 6 months of reform. But again, because I think it's going to be largely back-end loaded, it may be even later into the year. But I'd say, midyear would be the earliest. I don't think we'll have much color based on the first quarter results, frankly.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I appreciate your description on the pending acquisitions not being included in the guidance, but I was hoping you could give us a little color surrounding those pending deals, when you think those might close and how much those might contribute? And then also, just the development activity in the CapEx that you've outlined, how much of that is implied in the guidance that actually comes online in 2014?
Victor L. Campbell: Milton?
R. Milton Johnson: Yes, Frank. As far as acquisition impact, based on the pipeline today, I don't think it would be material impact in 2014. You may have read yesterday, or may have been released late last week, that our hospital transaction with Ascension in Kansas City for a 2-hospital transaction, is not going to happen, could not get the FTC clearance. So that deal is off. Of course, we are integrating our 3 hospitals in the Tampa market that we acquired from IASIS in 2013. I don't expect those -- those are built in to our guidance since we did have those -- acquired those by the end of the year. Those are built in. So right now, I don't expect -- hopefully, something will come up here in 2014 that will be attractive for us. But nothing in the pipeline that I think will be material as of today.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And on the development?
Samuel N. Hazen: Yes. And Frank, this is Sam. Let me add to the answer Milton just gave you around the capital. A couple of things. One, for any large capital expenditures that we do inside of HCA, we have a very specific process that we hold to, to ensure that the expectations around those capital projects are included in our budgets and plans as laid out in those approvals. So there's a natural flow of those expectations in our guidance. The second thing is, on new capital, there is a natural ramp-up. These are long-lived assets and we have a natural ramp-up that occurs on new capital that goes into the market. And some of that is fed into the guidance for 2014, but it's not that material as it relates to the overall performance of the company.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Taylor with Citigroup.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just wanted to clarify 2 things, I think it was Bill that was talking. The first is, when you went through some of the detailed metrics behind the 2014 guidance, did you give same-store admissions or just admissions outlook? Did I miss that?
William B. Rutherford: Yes, Gary. So we said, admissions -- equivalent admissions would range 1% to 2% and revenue per equivalent admissions would run 2% to 3%.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Sorry I missed that. And then, just my second clarification. When you said for 2014 you expect 7% to 9% of uninsured to gain coverage, you're saying 7% to 9% of your uninsured adjusted admissions volume, right, not 7% to 9% of the uninsured population in your market. I'm just trying to...
William B. Rutherford: Correct. That would be 7 -- as we step down enrollment, enrollment in our markets, our share kind of equates to 7% to 9% of our current uninsured volume.
Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Are you assuming a pro rata, so 9% get covered, that's a 9% impact -- I'm just trying to understand if you've baked in this concept of some of those folks are disproportionate utilizers or you just kind of pro rata the enrollment to your uninsured volume.
R. Milton Johnson: Yes. Gary, this is Milton. I mean, so the stat that Bill gave you is just the coverage statistic and we have other assumptions in the model around utilization from the population that gains coverage. So that's an independent variable from the overall coverage variable.
Operator: We'll go next to Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Sam, I just wanted to go back to the comment around outpatient observation. I think you said in your prepared remarks that they were up 8%, maybe 11,000 cases in the quarter. Was that all traditional Medicare? Was it across other payors? Just any color would be helpful.
Samuel N. Hazen: I don't have the exact payor mix of all of our observation visits in front of me. I'll say that the short stay admission decline was fairly broad-based across all of our payors. So I would infer from that, that as a result of our increase in observation visits, we saw natural growth in all the different payor classes for observations. I've got it in my office, I just didn't bring it in here with me. And I can get that information to Mark and he can get it back to you. But I think it's reasonable to assume that.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one other one. Just, Bill, can you remind us on the restricted basket and where you are now?
William B. Rutherford: Yes. We're -- about $750 million we anticipate by the end of the year.
Operator: We'll go to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So I want to ask about your surgery trends. When we look at the ratio of your inpatient surgeries to that of your inpatient admissions, it's really moved up. And I recall it being much higher. Before the downturn, probably 32% to 33%, we're now back up to 29%, 30%. So I guess, I'm just wondering if you can comment a little bit more about what you guys are seeing, whether this is some kind of comeback? Have you based out in CRM and some of the other things that cause the pressure on surgery and just broader thoughts on how surgeries play into your outlook for 2014?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Sam, do you want that one?
Samuel N. Hazen: Yes. When I think about surgery as a percent of our total business, I think there's 2 components that affect it as you look at that ratio. First, I mean, we are intentionally investing heavily in our surgical growth across the company. We've been doing that now for over 2 years and I think it's having an impact. It's all embedded in what we call our O.R. of choice initiative where we are intentionally detailing each of our surgical departments to ensure that they have the necessary equipment to meet our physician needs and patient needs, that they have the right process, improvement efforts in place to ensure efficiency. And then, we are very specific with our physician liaisons to respond to the individual physician's needs as it relates to scheduling and so forth. And I think, in addition to the capital that we've committed to that, those elements are driving improved performance for the company. And we continue to believe that there is capacity in that effort and opportunities for continued improvement in growth along the lines of what we've seen over the last couple of years. The second thing that affects the ratio that you're referring to is the fact that our emergency room volume has slowed a little bit and we haven't seen the emergency room admissions that we had seen in previous years. And a lot of the emergency room admission activity is medicine-oriented business. And when you put that into the mix, it affects that ratio that you were referring to as well. But when you look inside our market share and look specifically inside a surgical service line, we're seeing solid growth in orthopedics. We're seeing solid growth in neurosciences. We're gaining ground in general surgery categories. And so, I feel very good about that metric bumping up against the effort that I just mentioned to you. And again, I think 2014 is a year where we're still pretty optimistic around what we're doing on the surgical front.
Operator: We'll go next to Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: On the guidance, I'm trying to back into what you're implying for kind of core EBITDA growth. And I think we've talked previously and you mentioned 3% to 5% as kind of your core target. I'm getting closer to 2% to 4% within that guidance after making the adjustments for the stock comp and the health care IP. Just wondering if I'm missing anything, or if there's some reason for maybe some increased conservatism?
Victor L. Campbell: Milton, you want that one?
R. Milton Johnson: Sure. Justin, if you walk down the low end and the high end of our guidance, adjusting for the 3 items that we've identified, HITECH revenue, if you back out $120 million out of both sides of our guidance there for 2014, you back out the share -- or add back the share-based comp expense of $168 million to each side. And then, if you use the 1% to 2% of EBITDA, you'll get a range of $65 million to $130 million for health care reform. And so, if you adjust the high and the low for that, what I get -- we do that math and compare it to the adjusted number for '13, is at the low end we've got a growth rate implied of 1.75%; and on the high end, a growth rate implied, about 4.6%. So our -- that would be -- and that would be our core range there. So this year, we've guided ranging from our guidance from 1.75% to 4.6%. Clearly, when you think about the point estimate in that range, it would be in the 3% to 5% zone.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And if I could just ask, what are you assuming for the percentage of people that are newly covered within that guidance assumption? You mentioned that as one of the core -- percentage of enrollment previously uninsured, is one of the 4 key issues. Just to make sure what you're assuming there.
R. Milton Johnson: Yes, Justin. We're not going to disclose the detailed assumptions. What we wanted to do this morning was to give you, obviously, the projected impact on 2014 EBITDA. Bill walked through the 4 main variables of reform, one of which being the percentage in the exchange enrollment that's newly insured. But we're not going to disclose that level of our model. And we want some experience to see how it plays out over time, of course. But we're not going to disclose the detailed assumptions of those key variables at this point in time.
Victor L. Campbell: And obviously, as we build our model, we put ranges in for that and other items to get some comfort with it. But we start dwelling on single points and it lead you to the next one and the next one. So as the year goes, we'll provide a little more color on that. Thanks, Justin.
Operator: Our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Crédit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Wanted to go back to the offset of the previously insured, getting coverage and moving to the exchanges. Is there an assumption that you'll just flat-out loose volume versus the added network, I would assume if you capture, would actually be sort of incrementally beneficial to you. So I guess, one is, what that assumption is, just straight-up loss volume. Or does it largely just reflect lower pricing on the exchange and collection? And maybe just remind us of your pricing on the exchange relative to your commercial book.
William B. Rutherford: Ralph, Bill. So I'll walk you through and kind of do it before answering [indiscernible]. There's kind of 4 subsets of those previously uninsured. I think as Milton said, we're going to resist giving you our exact assumptions under each one of those, knowing that it's fluid and there's offsets and there's different points. But we know there's a subset of that population that is moving into a comparable product with really comparable revenues, so set that aside. There's a subset of that population that's moving into an exchange product. And there's a discount associated with that relative to participation. And there's likely some higher bad debts associated with that, salary deductibles and co-pays. There's a subset of that population to your question that moves into a restricted network. And a portion of those we may see in and out of network basis, given our footprint in the marketplace. And yes, there's an assumption for a portion of those that we lose because they get directed away from our network. But again, I think we're going to resist giving you the exact assumptions as we break that out, knowing that it becomes fluid. And it's part and parcel of a multiple other assumptions we're using in our estimate.
R. Milton Johnson: Yes. I think, too, one thing to think about here as health care reform is being implemented across the nation and, of course, we all read about and saw the disruption in the individual market. And so we have factored that in, into our guidance. The question I would have is, is that disruption a onetime event? So it may be an event that may have more impact here in 2014 than in later years. But again, you have to see that play out.
Operator: We'll go to Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A question also on the impact of reform. I think you said that the 1% to 2% positive is obviously exclusive of the Medicare cuts that you've seen now for a couple of years. So is it safe to assume net, net the ACA is still a negative for you guys in '14? And then, I'm also curious, the 1% to 2%, how does that vary by state? I know you've got 4 states you're spending Medicaid. So I'm just curious, is it a much bigger positive impact in those states and, obviously -- or and is it actually not positive in the other states?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Josh, this is Vic. If you go back and look at -- and these are percentage points cuts to market basket of productivity, we started seeing hits in 2011. There was a 0.25 reduction. Then in '12, it was 1.1. In '13, it was 80 basis points. In '14, it's another 80 basis points. So you can kind of run those numbers through and you can see that they're bigger than the upside range we just gave you for '14. So obviously, we've been incurring these cuts to get there. And so, it'll take a little while for that to offset it. The second piece of it, I think, we're not going to go into state-by-state. So obviously, there's still not a lot of data. We've obviously made assumptions. There are not many of our states with Medicaid expansion, but we do get some benefits a little bit in California and Colorado. We're really small in Kentucky. And in Nevada, we would pick up some as well through Medicaid. We're also continuing to be hopeful that we'll see some states step up and expand their Medicaid in out years. But at this point, we're going to kind of hold back in terms of any specific state information.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess not necessarily quantifying the states, but I'm thinking about what if Florida does go, et cetera, this year, just what's the incremental delta in your average state that has expanded Medicaid versus the average delta...
Victor L. Campbell: Yes. We're not going to that detail at this point. We'll see as we get later in the year. If we learn and have some real-time data that's worth sharing, we'll go there. But right now, those are the assumptions we're willing to put out on the table.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you talk a little bit about what your experience has been like with the use of Certified Application Counselors in hospitals? Has that gone smoothly? Has it improved as the technology on the exchanges has gotten better? And then also, if you can maybe talk about any benefit from presumptive eligibility that you're seeing?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Bill, do you want those...
William B. Rutherford: Yes. Gary, this is Bill. Thanks for the question. So we have about 400 Certified Application Counselors throughout our system that continue to screen and counsel patients in our facilities. We definitely have seen that activity ramp up compared to October and November when there were issues with the website. And that continues to be an active part of our reform effort. We continue to evaluate some other outreach efforts for -- within our marketplace for uninsured as well. But the Certified Application Counselor activity continues to counsel a lot of people. And we have seen the assistance in the application increase here in December and January and hoped to see that continue to grow in February and March. It did have a slow start, just given the website piece of that. On presumptive eligibility, we're still working with our states on there. You know some of our states already have presumptive eligibility. There is a certification process and application process that you go through. We think that, ultimately, will just allow us to accelerate some Medicaid applications versus necessarily increase our net-net yield. And so, we're still optimistic on the presumptive eligibility piece.
Operator: We'll go next to Tom Gallucci with FBR.
Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: First, I just wanted to clarify. Did you have -- outline the margin expectation for EBITDA for 2014? And then, from a bigger picture standpoint, we're sort of seeing the impact of the exchanges and deductibles rising there in the private sector traditionally. How are you sort of thinking about the seasonality of the business these days? Is it materially different as you think to the future compared to the past?
R. Milton Johnson: With respect to margin, I think in the comments, we said margin maintenance, so we're trying to manage our cost to match our revenue and would be margin maintenance would be the target for 2014. Sam, do you want to respond to the seasonality?
Samuel N. Hazen: I think if you look back over the past few years, we started to see more outpatient demand occur in the last half of the year, especially in surgical areas and some other outpatient service lines. That has been a shift. We've heard it from our physicians and we've seen it in our data and so forth. And I think it's natural to assume that, that's coming from hard deductibles and co-pay requirements that get exhausted as the year progresses and people decide to go ahead and get their procedures done in the latter part of the year. So on the outpatient side, I do see more seasonality toward the end of the year than what we've seen in the past. And actually, in this fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, on a sequential basis, our outpatient surgical activity, I think, grew somewhere around 6.5% to 7%. Last year, it grew about 6%. So it really wasn't changed materially from the previous year as far as the sequential performance on that particular metric. Obviously, the first quarter has variation from 1 year to the next as it relates to flu season activity, I think, primarily. But that would be the only thing that drives uniqueness from 1 year to the next. But clearly, on the outpatient side, we have seen a seasonality shift that is more in the back half of the year as opposed to the first half of the year.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Joanna Gajuk - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is actually Joanna Gajuk, filling in for Kevin today. I would just -- I'd like to ask a little bit more about the reform assumptions there and also what you are doing around that. First, as a follow-up to the comment you made about what you include in terms of utilization assumption for the people getting insurance, we are thinking that it's probably sicker people that are buying insurance. So if you can comment how you feel about that. And also around the outreach for '14, your markets around reform and if you can maybe shed some light in terms of are you having more success signing up people for Medicaid for those in the Medicaid expansion stage and how that compared to your success rates in signing up people for core Medicaid, so to speak?
Victor L. Campbell: Bill, you want to...
William B. Rutherford: Yes. So on utilization, I think as Milton mentioned before, we do have a utilization factor built into our model for the newly insured. That's just one of many variables that's in our model, so I'm hesitant to really kind of talk about what that actual utilization factor is. I think we've all read reports about some increased activity. And so we do have a utilization factor in on that piece as we look at that 7% to 9%. But it's one of many variables that's included in our model. Regarding the outreach, principally, our efforts have been around our CACs, our Certified Application Counselors, as people visit our facilities. We have an effort underway in several -- in a couple of markets to do outreach for uninsured patients that have visited our facilities over the past 12 to 18 months. And that includes both outbound calls and other outreach efforts. So I think it's too early to kind of report on the net effect of that. You also may know that we have fairly robust Medicaid eligibility processes already in place at our facilities. So if an individual shows up, we assist them with evaluating coverage options. And if they turn out to be eligible for Medicaid within our states already, we go through a Medicaid eligibility process to assist them to gain coverage. So all of that is part of not only our ongoing operations effort, but some increased activity relative to reform adoption.
Operator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I'm going to have a 2-part here. First of all, you didn't really provide much update on Parallon. Is there anything to say there? And then second, on the exchange area itself, thanks for the comments about where you're at with respect to the bronze and silver. When you think about your market share in the markets where you're at and how you're positioned on the exchanges, do you think you're sort of in a position to maintain your current share? I know there were some discussions about out-of-network strategies and so forth. Give us some flavor for a little bit more how you're positioned with the payors on the exchanges if possible?
Victor L. Campbell: All right...
R. Milton Johnson: Let me make couple of comments on Parallon. Bill, I'll ask you to maybe comment, as well, before we go to the exchange positioning. First of all, I think that Parallon, actually, is moving very well, going very well. We think about 2014, we've got The Outsource Group, our acquisition to complete the integration into Parallon and we see some upside there of course with that. With respect to LifePoint implementation, it continues to move on schedule and we should be fully implemented with LifePoint in 2014. And then of course, we are starting to build out of our service center for CHP in Cincinnati and that is on schedule and underway. And looking forward to starting that transition into the consolidated environment for CHP. So things at Parallon are moving very well and on track with our expectations.
William B. Rutherford: Yes. We're still bullish on Parallon. We're seeing our opportunities in our pipeline continue to be out there and the team is really performing well.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Do you want to talk about the metal position on the exchange?
R. Milton Johnson: I think, again, we've -- we've added, I think, again, the number of hospitals we have in each level at the lowest or second lowest tier. But Juan, any other comments you have about or knowledge you have about...
Juan Vallarino: Sure. AJ, it's still evolving. It's a relatively small part of the business. [indiscernible] There are some markets, very few, where we're not positioned correctly. There are lot more markets, the major markets where we are very well positioned. And until we get enrollment data, I think, it's too early to tell how poorly positioned or how well positioned we really are.
Victor L. Campbell: And Milton?
R. Milton Johnson: Yes. Let me just add with respect to reform. Obviously, over the coming year, we're going to continue to monitor the actual exchange volume, understand utilization, the bad debt, the capture of the other network share. And also with respect to Parallon, monitoring our revenue cycle capabilities to make sure that we can be effective in collecting the patient portions of any out-of-pocket that is due from this newly insured group. And again, we'll continue to look at opportunities to be in more networks in the exchange as we go through 2014. And then, as we see how our strategy is playing out, we'll be evaluating our strategy market-by-market and could make changes if we feel like that we would be better positioned in the network. So there's a number of moving parts with respect to our reform strategy as we enter in 2014. And I'm sure those strategies will be considered and be constantly reviewed, as well, throughout the year.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Thank you, team. Thanks all of you for being on the call and Mark is here all day and I may be. So have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. We appreciate your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Janine, thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call, including those of you who are listening to our webcast. With me this morning as usual: our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operations. And then we have several other members of our management team here today to assist in the Q&A, should we need them. Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. And as you heard, this morning's call is being recorded, replay will be available later today. With that, Richard Bracken.
Richard M. Bracken: All right. Thank you, Vic. Good morning, and thank you to everyone for joining our call today. Earlier this morning, the company reported its third quarter 2013 earnings results, which were consistent with the release we provided on October 17. Before our team provides additional details and analysis of the quarter, I'd like to start with a few general observations. We were pleased with the results of the third quarter. Patient volumes for the third quarter, as expressed in same-facility admissions, increased 0.7% while same-facility adjusted admissions increased 1.1%. This volume growth was generally consistent with the trends we have experienced during the first 6 months of the year. Similar to the second quarter, in addition to volume growth, we were able to achieve favorable earnings performance through an improved service mix and continued efficiencies in our expense structure. Revenues increased 4.9% and adjusted EBITDA increased 4.6% to $1.603 billion compared to the same period of the prior year. EBITDA operating margin for the quarter was 19%. Importantly, we believe that our growth strategies continue to position the company well. The underlying size and strength of our markets, our asset configurations, the expansion of service capacity and access points, a focus on quality care and patient service all supported by an appropriately sized capital spending plan have helped us achieve these favorable results. Two important components of our growth agenda are to ensure patients have easy and convenient access to our networks and to assure that we have sufficient capacity to take care of patients in both an efficient and a safe environment. In part to accomplish this, we have increased capital spending and selectively acquired certain facilities, both hospitals and outpatient centers. Capital spending in 2012 and 2013 combined will approximate $3.8 billion with the majority of these expenditures going to improve access and increased capacity. HCA has added over these past 2 years approximately 900 new inpatient beds, which includes 2 new hospitals. We have added over 200 new emergency room beds, both in our existing hospitals and in new sites off our main hospital campuses. We've added to our networks with strategic acquisitions. Again over the same period of time, 4 hospitals, 10 ambulatory surgical centers and 17 urgent care centers have been acquired to expand our networks. We believe our strategies will continue to position us well to accommodate market demand. Last week, we announced that the company completed a $500 million share repurchase from our equity sponsors in conjunction with their secondary offering of 30 million shares. Our repurchase represents approximately 10.6 million shares and was funded through capacity under our revolving credit facilities. We expect this repurchase to be accretive to earnings. Also last week, the Joint Commission released their list of top performing organizations. And I'd like to recognize those HCA hospitals that were recognized based on core measure performance data for 2012. HCA had 110, or 80%, of its licensed hospitals in the United States among those included as top performers on key quality measures. We believe this to be continuing confirmation of our operating team's dedication to clinical excellence. And finally, regarding the ACA, we know you have a lot of questions about our contracting results and ACA enrollment outreach. And Milton will comment on these important issues in just a moment. But from a broader view, we, like most Americans, have been closely watching the rollout. The much-publicized issues with the federal website have not deterred our internal positioning. Fundamentally, we believe the most successful and sustainable strategies to participate efficiently over the long run in the ACA will be those that emphasize comprehensive patient access points, state-of-the-art and well-capitalized facilities and clinical technologies, a proven and transparent track record of providing high-quality care and service and the ability to leverage the cost structure to provide better value for the consumer. These, of course, are the strategies that we've been working on for years. We feel confident that whatever turns might come regarding the ACA, we are well positioned to participate and provide quality health care services. And with that, I'll ask Milton to take the call.
R. Milton Johnson: Thank you, Richard, and good morning to all. First, let me introduce you to Bill Rutherford, our recently announced, newly appointed Chief Financial Officer, effective January 1, 2014. Bill is here today and available to participate in the Q&A. I trust most of you had a chance to review our third quarter earnings release issued this morning, which was in line with our preview of the quarter. Sam and I will provide some additional information regarding our third quarter results, and then we will take your questions. We were very pleased with our third quarter performance, which was the result of solid top line revenue growth and excellent expense management by our operating management teams. Revenues in the third quarter increased to $8.456 billion, up 4.9% compared to the prior year's third quarter, driven by both volume increases and revenue per unit growth. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.603 billion compared to $1.533 billion in the third quarter of 2012. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 19%, consistent with the prior year's third quarter. However, adjusting for the reduction in our EHR incentive income, adjusted EBITDA margin would have exceeded the prior year's third quarter by 70 basis points. Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. totaled $365 million or $0.79 per diluted share compared to $360 million or $0.78 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012. Overall, third quarter volume trends were generally consistent with our first 2 quarters of 2013 with same-facility admissions increasing 0.7% and same-facility equivalent admissions increasing 1.1% as compared to last year's third quarter. Our same-facility medical admissions increased 0.1%, while same-facility surgical admissions increased 1.8% compared to the prior year. During the third quarter, same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 0.4% and 1.4%, respectively. Same-facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 9.6% on a same-facility basis and now represents 29.7% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions declined 0.3% in the quarter compared to the prior year, while same-facility Medicaid equivalent admissions increased 0.8% compared to the prior year's third quarter. In the third quarter, same-facility managed care and other admissions declined 1.1%, while same-facility managed care and others equivalent admissions declined 1.5% compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, uninsured admissions increased 10.1% on a same-facility basis compared to the prior year. Same-facility uninsured admissions represent 8.8% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 8% in last year's third quarter. Fairly consistent with the second quarter results, same-facility emergency room visits increased 0.9% in the quarter. Same-facility surgeries increased 1.3% in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 2.9% in our same-facility inpatient surgeries, while our same-facility outpatient surgeries increased 0.4% compared to the prior year. We were very pleased with our inpatient surgical growth rate of 2.9%. It is the highest growth rate for same-facility inpatient surgical growth since the third quarter of 2002. During the third quarter, revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.4% on a same-facility basis. This is primarily due to a 2% increase in our same-facility case mix, which is the measure of inpatient acuity. Same-facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission declined 2.5% in the quarter, while Medicare case mix index increased 1.2% and helped to mitigate some of the impact of the sequester. Same-facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission, excluding the Medicaid waiver programs, increased 1.4% and same-facility Medicaid case mix increased 3.5% over the prior year. Same-facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission reflected solid growth at 6.4% over the prior year period. Managed care and other case mix increased 3.4% over last year. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $252 million in the third quarter compared to the prior year. And during the third quarter, same-facility charity care discounts totaled $876 million, an increase of $68 million from the prior-year period, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.084 billion, an increase of $184 million from the prior period. Now moving to expenses. Our expense management trends remains favorable and consistent with the second quarter of this year. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.9% compared to the prior year. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.3% on a same-facility basis. Same-facility productivity performance as measured by man hours per equivalent admission declined 0.3% over the prior year period. And same-facility wage rate growth was 2% in the third quarter. Personnel costs associated with physician employment increased by $7 million or 2.5% from the previous year's third quarter. Noncash share-based compensation expense associated with the company's management equity plan increased $14 million in the quarter compared to last year's third quarter. Same-facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 4.6% from the prior year period, primarily reflecting the reclassification of nonequity member administrative fees from a reduction of supply expense to revenues. The amount reclassified was approximately $40 million and contributed 300 basis points to the growth of supply expense per equivalent admission in the third quarter. And the reclassification had no impact on adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and we will anniversary this change in the fourth quarter of this year. Same-facility other operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1% from the prior year period. We recognized $75 million in electronic health record incentive income in the third quarter compared to $131 million in last year's third quarter. This is consistent with our expectations. The company also incurred approximately $26 million and $24 million in EHR-related expense in the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities totaled $900 million in the quarter, compared to $655 million last year. The $245 million increase was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital of $136 million and $51 million in lower income taxes. During the quarter, capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, totaled $451 million. Year-to-date capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, totaled $1.347 billion. And we invested $440 million in various acquisitions during the quarter. At September 30, 2013, the company's debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.39x compared to 4.41x at June 30, 2013. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.334 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities. Before turning the call over to Sam, let me give you a brief update on exchange contracting for the Affordable Care Act. Approximately 152 of our 156 U.S. hospitals or 97% of our U.S. hospitals have an exchange contract with access to a bronze plan. Of the approximately 152 hospitals that have access to a bronze plan, approximately 93 hospitals are in the lowest or second-lowest bronze plan. Approximately 77 of our 156 U.S. hospitals have access to the lowest or second-lowest silver plans. It is our belief that network participation will evolve over time as we and others adjust to various market dynamics. But now let me turn the call over to Sam.
Samuel N. Hazen: Good morning. I'll begin my comments this morning with more detail on the company's volume trends for the quarter. 6 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth in year-over-year same-facility inpatient admissions. The following divisions had strong growth in the quarter: East Florida, which includes Miami and surrounding markets; Far West, which includes California and Las Vegas; and TriStar, which includes Nashville. 10 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth in same-facility adjusted admissions. Our London division had growth in both same-facility inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions. Overall, the growth inside our portfolio with domestic hospitals was comparable to the past 2 quarters. 54% of our domestic hospitals had growth in inpatient admissions and 55% had growth in adjusted admissions. Emergency room volumes were not as strong in the quarter as compared to recent years. Although 8 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth in same-facility emergency room visits, we had inconsistent patterns across the company with stronger growth in Florida, California and Nevada and softness in Texas, Utah and Virginia. We have seen a general weakness in the lower-acuity emergency room business. And there has been some increased competition in a number of markets. We feel these 2 factors are part of the reason for the slower growth rates. The company continues to invest significantly in its service lines to increase access and capacity, to improve operational efficiency and to enhance quality and service. Total surgeries for the company on a same-facility basis were up 1.3% in the quarter with inpatient surgery volumes up 2.9%, hospital-based outpatient surgeries up 1.1% and our ambulatory surgery division down 0.5%. As you heard, this was a very strong quarter for surgical volumes. We believe that our efforts inside our surgical departments to improve our operations, clinical outcomes and surgeon satisfaction contributed to this growth in surgery volumes. Inside our ambulatory surgery division, overall cases, which include certain endoscopic and pain management procedures that are not counted in our surgery volumes grew by 4.4% as a result of some recent acquisitions and new facility development. As indicated, acuity this past quarter was up. This increase was primarily driven by the strong inpatient surgical volumes. Same-facility surgical admissions accounted for 29% of total admissions, an increase of 40 basis points as compared to prior year. This is the first quarter in many quarters where growth in surgical admissions outpaced growth in medical admissions. Additionally, within the overall surgical business, we had strong growth in higher-acuity areas such as orthopedics, neurosurgery and cardiovascular surgery. Same-facility behavioral service admissions were up 3.4% and acute rehabilitation admissions were up 8.5% in the quarter. These metrics are generally consistent with the first half of the year. And finally, same-facility deliveries were up 0.4%, which was similar to the first half of the year. Neonatal intensive care admissions were essentially flat for the quarter. However, overall neonatal patient days were down because of a drop in Medicaid patient days. Commercial patient days in our neonatal intensive care units increased slightly. Now let me transition to some market share highlights for the 12 months ended March 2013. Once again, this is the most current data available for the company and it represents almost 90% of the company's markets. The company's inpatient market share during this period increased 54 basis points to 23.7%. Overall, inpatient demand in our markets during this period was essentially flat. This is a slight weakening from prior periods and reflects a weak first quarter in 2013. Inpatient demand across HCA markets in the first quarter declined by close to 0.9%. Again, we believe the calendar issues we discussed on our first quarter call explain the significant portion of this decline. Sequentially, market share increased in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the fourth quarter. This is the seventh consecutive quarter the company has gained market share. We gained market share in 15 out of 17 service lines, which is a slight improvement as compared to our last report. HCA had market share gains in 28 out of 37 markets with growth in 8 out of our top 10 earnings markets. Market share in both the commercial and in-migration segments of our business grew, reflecting continued success with our outreach efforts in these 2 distinct markets. Across all of these metrics, the company's market share trends are generally consistent with past reports. This performance reflects solid execution of our growth agenda, which continues to evolve and continues to be resourced appropriately. And finally, I would like to comment briefly on 3 exciting initiatives inside of HCA. The first one is the recent development of our clinical data warehouse. For many years, we have had access to clinical outcomes measures within our information systems, but we have not had good visibility into the information or transactions, if you will, that generated these outcomes. Now with our clinical data warehouse, we will be able to use this information in innovative ways to improve our quality outcomes, to eliminate inefficiencies in the process of delivering patient care and to find new ways to drive growth. The second initiative is the rollout of our oneHR plan. Similar to other HCA shared services initiatives, this plan is designed to consolidate certain human resource functions that currently reside in our hospitals. By consolidating these functions into specialized centers, we should gain some cost synergies. But more importantly, we expect to improve our performance in recruitment, compensation management and education. These areas are critical to ensuring we have a competent workforce that can deliver patient care in an efficient and effective manner. And finally, we are reorganizing our corporate performance improvement department by distributing these resources to our operating divisions. We believe this new structure, which combines corporate and field resources, will have many benefits. It will allow us to sustain our process improvement efforts more consistently. It will allow us to deploy best practices faster across the company. And it will increase our capacity for implementing company initiatives, such as our Clinical Excellence program, ER wait time reduction program, surgery room turnover and others. All of these initiatives leverage the unique scale of HCA. And we expect them to improve our services and improve our overall efficiency, which in turn should enhance our overall competitive positioning in our markets. With that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Sam, thank you very much. Janine, if you'd like to come on and take a queue for calls?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: I'm wondering if you can walk us through your thought process with -- getting to the heart of some of the criticisms of HCA, the thought process behind your exchange contracting. I know you mentioned that you expect it to be a process to go on over time. But I think there's some confusion as to how you see your positioning vis-à-vis others and why perhaps HCA's unique market positioning and scale and scope might play a role in those decisions.
Victor L. Campbell: All right, Sheryl, thank you. Milton, Richard? Who wants to lead off of it?
R. Milton Johnson: Yes. Let me lead off, and maybe others may want to add some thoughts. I think we've been very consistent describing all year our approach to exchange contracting. We have, in my view, taken a very consistent, disciplined approach, one where we have looked at the market dynamics, the particular sort of market makeup with the size of employers, the competition in the market and a structure exchange contracting accordingly to how we think the behavior of the uninsured may react in certain markets. Of course, currently with all the uncertainty around the exchanges early on, adds some additional confusion to it. But hopefully over time that, of course, will get worked out. But as I said, the result of our work has been that we have access to bronze plans in most of our hospitals, 97%. Almost 100 of our hospitals in the lowest or second-lowest bronze plan, so we feel good about that. We do think that in certain markets over time, where we may not be in the lowest-priced offering in a particular market, it'd be interesting to see how that evolves. In many of these markets, we have a large footprint. We have significant capacity with our emergency rooms. And it will be interesting to see how that plays out over time with respect to certain out-of-network activity in certain markets. So we feel good about where we are with our contracting strategy. I think it reflects the approach that we've been describing from the beginning that it would be disciplined. And again, we like where we are. But as I said in my comments, also believe that over the coming years, it will evolve, that network participations will change. We will probably make changes. And I'm sure the competitors will make changes. So this is not going to be a static situation in my view. And I think as it evolves, we'll be well positioned to compete for all the reasons that Richard described in his comments about our positioning with our core operational strategies.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I was curious if you could comment about the DOJ's ruling to HHS about purchasing premiums. I know that CMS just came out with a frequently asked question discouraging this. But any thoughts about that particular initiative and any other of the outreach initiatives associated with the Affordable Care Act?
Victor L. Campbell: Richard?
Richard M. Bracken: Let me just comment. Obviously, there are any number of outreach efforts that are out there that have been discussed. And really similar to some of the comments that Milton was making, we're evaluating and looking at them all to determine our course of actions. We believe that over time, best practices will surface. At this point, we have made no decisions to follow any particular course. You know that we were clear last time on our call about the kind of things we're doing in our hospitals in terms with our counselors. And we've provided some dollars to not-for-profit organizations. But really that's a pretty modest effort compared to what you read about. I think our course is going to be one of being careful, seeing what best practices are, what is clearly in the zone of compliance and charting our course appropriately. So I think that evolves over time -- this time just like our contracting strategies.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: My question is on Parallon. And you guys have made a number of acquisitions this year. I guess, I'd be curious just to get an update on what capabilities you think you've acquired and how you're approaching the market with your suite of services there. And maybe just some numbers at this point on what the revenue run rate looks like.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Darren, thank you. Milton, you want to take that one as well?
R. Milton Johnson: Sure. A couple of transactions this year, Martin, Fletcher, a locum tenens organization. A larger transaction was The Outsource Group. We closed that July 1. So we've got 1 quarter under our belt with that transaction. Again, The Outsource Group is an organization that's based in St. Louis, about 4,000 employees. They provide revenue cycle management, extended business office outsourcing, Medicaid eligibility, which will be a new capability that we will have now in Parallon. Various other things, like on-site financial counseling and early-out self-pay collections, primary and secondary bad debt collections and the like. So it complements Parallon's core operations very well and brings a couple of new capabilities to us as well. Roughly, The Outsource Group should be probably around $125 million of revenue on an annual basis to size it for you. And we would expect margins in that business to ultimately be somewhere in the kind of the high-teens to possibly 20% range to size how we're thinking about that opportunity. Overall, Parallon, things are going well. Our operations with respect to our revenue cycle continues to go well. We are on track with our LifePoint implementation. I think they referenced that in their call. We have -- at their request, we've worked together with LifePoint to accelerate the implementation. It should be complete by the middle of next year with all of their hospitals. I think we'll have roughly about 35 hospitals implemented on a consolidated revenue cycle by the end of this year. So that's going well. Our CHP, Catholic Healthcare Partners transaction, we're starting up with them, early developments are going well. We will build a new center for them in Cincinnati. And so we are currently working through that process to get that site determined and up and running and start the migration. We have moved their revenue cycle employees over to Parallon. So that has occurred. So things are going on track. HealthTrust continues to do well. We're seeing solid growth in earnings from HealthTrust this year, year-to-date about 11%, roughly 10% to 11% in HealthTrust, so again going well. So overall, Parallon is performing well. I continue to think that over the coming years, we'll have many opportunities to grow through Parallon.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: You guys did a great job controlling costs so far this year. But when we think about 2014, obviously there's going be a revenue opportunity from covering uninsured. I just am wondering whether there's something that you would point to as saying, "Hey, we tightened our belt because things were tough this year. Next year, when maybe we get a little bit of a tailwind from collections, we might look to invest in XYZ." I wasn't sure if there's any thoughts about cost growth next year or things that maybe you dialed back on this year that need to be invested in next year.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Kevin, thank you. Sam, you want to take that one?
Samuel N. Hazen: Our operating teams have done a really good job reacting to the changes in volume trends that we saw starting back in the first quarter, as we mentioned on the past calls, and then what we've done in the third quarter here. I think when you think about what HCA is trying to do, it's more of a systemic effort at trying to gain efficiencies than it is an episodic effort at responding to certain dynamics here or there. And I mentioned a couple of the things that we're doing that will have efficiency opportunities embedded in them. And I think those will help us drive toward more efficiencies in our operations. And that's through eliminating redundancies in overhead, eliminating process inefficiencies and identifying new ways to leverage our supply chain. On our biggest cost trend, our labor, at this particular point, we're not seeing any unusual wage pressures in the marketplace as we think about our positioning today and look forward. And so our belief on our wage trends are that we can manage those consistent with where they've been and create the right kind of balance between that particular cost category and our revenue trends. So the company's efforts broadly on the cost front continue very aggressively and will, I think, create the kind of trends that we need to maintain in order to be effective. Like I said in my comments, our performance improvement reorganization is a huge opportunity for the company to create a better structure for sustaining and identifying new ways to generate efficiencies in our operations. The clinical data warehouse is a very unique asset that we think only resides inside of HCA at the level that it doesn't [ph] within our company. And that is going to be a very rich bit of data that allows us to improve our quality, find new ways to create process improvement and clinical efficiency, as well as cost efficiency. And so those things are big-ticket items for the company, and we feel good about how they present themselves over the next few years. And if we execute on those, as we've executed on other initiatives, I think we're going to be well positioned to keep our costs where we need them to be.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I think I may have asked you about capital deployment. You just did a $500 million repurchase this last week, opportunistic. But it was a little smaller than some of the other repurchases you've done. Is that just a function of where you're at with your banks? And then also maybe comment on the hospital acquisition environment. So those 2 aspects of capital deployment.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Milton, you want to lead that?
R. Milton Johnson: Sure. Well, with respect to our share repurchase, $500 million share repurchase we just closed, the size was limited by our restricted payments basket, which at the time of the transaction was $878 million. And we expect at the end of this year, we should be somewhere around $550 million to $600 million of restricted payments basket capacity. And that, of course, would be net of the $500 million share repurchase. So that was somewhat of a limiting factor for us here in the -- at the end of the -- or the beginning, I should say, of the fourth quarter. With respect to acquisition opportunities, there's not a significant acquisition in terms of financial impact on our balance sheet that we see here in the short term. We have several transactions that we are looking at, more of what I would call the tuck-in acquisitions that we've completed, like we did down in Tampa with the IASIS facilities. As you know, we're looking at a transaction, it's public information down in Florida. We have a transaction that we're looking at in New Orleans. And of course, we're still -- the transactions of a couple of hospitals in Kansas City, still underway, going through the FTC process. So we continue to have those that are out there moving, and we'll continue to look for good opportunities through acquisition. We said, I think, for a few years here that we think the marketplace will present opportunities for us for acquisitions. We've got the capacity with our balance sheet to be out and to complete those transactions. So again, nothing that's material to our balance sheet that we're working on now but several smaller transactions that we'll be very pleased to complete somewhere in the coming several months.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Joshua Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My question is around reform and the impact. You guys have spoken in the past about potentially sizing what you think that impact could be. So I'm curious as to sort of the timing of when you think you'll have your thoughts together on that. And maybe what are some of the key variables that you're still waiting to nail down?
Victor L. Campbell: Milton?
R. Milton Johnson: Yes. Well, I think we'll be looking at 2014 reform guidance when we give our annual 2014 guidance. And that will happen probably in February of '14. The variables are, I think, the biggest one is, especially here in the early part of reform, what will be the overall uptake in our markets through the exchanges. Will states ultimately expand Medicaid or not? And as you know, only 4 states that we operate in expanded Medicaid. So the big states to us, like Texas and Florida, did not expand. So how will that evolve over the coming couple of years would be very interesting for us and material, I think, to our model. So I think again those are the ones that we've talked about, just the overall uptake, our ability to gain market share in these markets where we do have contracts. And those would be, I think, the key variables for us. We have a good sense right now of what our pricing would be, of course, now that we've negotiated our rates. But still the overall volume uptake is going to be the big question.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Whit Mayo with Robert H. Baird (sic) [Robert W. Baird].
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I was just curious on the bronze plans that you've contracted with. What did the deductibles look like for those plans on average? And how are you thinking about collecting that? And is there any experience you have on any existing individual plans that you can refer to as kind of a collection rate?
R. Milton Johnson: Well, I think -- I'm looking at Juan. The maximum out-of-pocket on an individual bronze plan, Juan, do you remember that number?
Juan Vallarino: $6,240.
R. Milton Johnson: $6,240. And then if you're at the -- at 100% up to 250% of the Federal Poverty Guideline, now you can't do it with a bronze plan. But if you are in the silver, the second-lowest silver level plan, if you participate at that level, there's a cash assistance program from the federal government that will assist you with your out-of-pocket cost. So for example, at a 100% of the Federal Poverty Guideline, I think the actuarial value of that silver plan plus the cash assistance is about 94%. So it's a very high coverage. And again it moves up to -- it reduces up to 250% with a cash assistance plan. But the maximum out-of-pocket for an individual is just over $6,000.
Juan Vallarino: And it varies by income. So the less income you have, the higher -- the lower the out-of-pocket.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just following up on an earlier comment. Could you discuss your thoughts on retaining ER volumes, especially for those where you might not be in network? And how do you think about reimbursement for those volumes [ph]?
Victor L. Campbell: Sam or Milt, you want to address that?
R. Milton Johnson: Well, I think you're referring to -- in the markets on the exchange, where if a patient presents to our emergency room, they're in an emergent [ph] situation, of course, we will take care of that patient. And then we will bill the payor out-of-network charges. So typically, that would be full charges. Practically, it could be settled for something less. But there's a lot of variation in those various rates. But obviously, it would be something most likely at or higher than the commercial rate for those patients.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Crédit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was wondering if you can give us a sense of what your current success rate is in terms of getting Medicaid eligibles signed up today and maybe how similar or not you think that would be in terms of getting exchange eligibles signed up next year.
Victor L. Campbell: Sam, you want that one?
Samuel N. Hazen: We have a very comprehensive effort across all of our hospitals to ensure that we have adequate resources in our facilities to assist with Medicaid eligibility applications and so forth. As Milton mentioned a minute ago, The Outsource Group will provide additional resources for the company to buttress those where it needs to, especially in those states where we've seen Medicaid expansion. I don't have the exact percentages here around how many applicants today get approved. But the vast majority of them tend to get approved for Medicaid. So it's north of 50%, probably around 60% or so of eligible Medicaid beneficiaries get approved. We work with those other patients to get other government funding or they follow through on the application process insufficiently and they wind up not getting approved. But we have a pretty high success rate. We monitor that by facility, we monitor that by state to understand where do we have opportunities to improve it. We think the presumptive eligibility procedures that are out there will assist us in that process somewhat. How much, we don't know yet, but it will have some impact on those metrics. But we have a pretty good program and the numbers are somewhere in that probably 2/3 range approved. And 1/3 that don't get approved for a host of reasons, some of which their income is too high, some of which their applications don't get turned in or we can't locate the patient, whatever the case may be. But again, we're evaluating those resources and looking very closely at those metrics on a routine basis to enhance the procedures where we can.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna International Group.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on Whit's question. It brought up something interesting to me. Even if the actuarial value is 94%, how do you guys ultimately collect the deductible? Do you bill the Feds directly? Do you bill the plans? Are you responsible of getting it through the subsidized member?
Victor L. Campbell: Juan Vallarino is going to answer that one.
Juan Vallarino: You bill the plan.
R. Milton Johnson: Yes, the subsidized [indiscernible] mentioned would come through the plan.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Maybe to go back to the use of the Certified Application Counselors and given the difficulty with the exchanges so far, how have they behaved or how have they acted differently than you would expect them to work once the exchanges are up and running? And have you seen actually any improvement in being able to get people signed up on the exchanges?
Victor L. Campbell: All right, Milton, again.
R. Milton Johnson: Well, sure, we've been tracking the early activity with our application -- our Certified Application Counselors. We have approximately 400 of them. Quite frankly, they've encountered the difficulties that the public has encountered as trying to access the exchange via the Internet. So it's been off to a slow start. And that relative thought [ph] to the issues, then that's not unexpected. I think over time, we're going to see that improve as the system stabilizes. And as we gain greater access on a more consistent basis to the system, then we'll see that. We've trained our coordinators and we feel we're well positioned to perform. It's just a matter right now more of the technical difficulties that we're dealing with as far as getting people actually signed up.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Zimmerman with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was hoping you could provide some comments on what you're seeing in the company's initiatives regarding the rehab and behavioral health services business. And are you continuing to see market share gains in these segments?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Sam, you want to address rehab and behavioral?
Samuel N. Hazen: We have about 55 behavioral units inside of HCA today and we have a similar number of in-patient rehabilitation facilities inside the company. As I mentioned, we're up about 3.5% on behavioral admissions in the quarter. We're up about 8.5% on rehab admissions. Rehab is up 10% for the year and behavioral is up about 2.5% for the year. And that is slightly down. We still have opportunities to invest in these service lines within a number of our markets. And we are doing that. We're adding capacity in certain situations. We're adding physician capability in other situations that will allow us to grow our volumes. We still think there are opportunities for managing our continuum of care more effectively in certain situations that will enhance our ability to deliver more care in these 2 service lines. But when you look at the market share data in both of these service lines, we do have gains in share across the company. The behavioral service line, in particular, shows very strong demand curve. Rehab is not as strong but also stronger than other medical areas. And we think managing the continuum in total is a very important part of what we're trying to get done in the marketplace. It's really not just with those 2 service lines. We're doing it more broadly with pediatric service lines, with trauma service lines, with deeper capabilities in other service lines. We're using our infrastructure within our markets to manage the continuum more effectively. We have what we call transfer centers in each of our markets that allow us to assist the patient and the physician in navigating our continuum more effectively. That's allowed us to keep more patients in our system. And so we think those structural things will continue to evolve and allow us to gain share hopefully down the road.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just wanted to follow up on an earlier question. Broadly looking ahead, right, I know reform is a black box for '14. But x that, I think you've talked about yourselves being a 5% grower on the EBITDA line, give or take. I just wanted to confirm as we look ahead to '14, is this a reasonable starting point to think about x reform? And I know you have about -- I think you have $100 million headwind from lower health care IT revenues. Any other headwinds or tailwinds you could point us to outside of that 5% growth would be helpful as well.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Milton?
R. Milton Johnson: Yes, sure. And I think, Justin, what we've been saying is a 3% to 5% EBITDA growth, to clarify. But seriously, and excluded -- I think, as you look at next year, I think what we've indicated is that, excluding the EHR incentive income, which is going to decline as we all know. We captured most of that upside in the early years of the opportunity. And also excluding the impact of the noncash share-based expense that we're incurring, again we're unique because of the LBO when we've had to restart our management equity plan, unique in our sector in that we have an increasing cost there. And after I think next year, that should then be up to its run rate. But excluding the impact of noncash share-based costs and excluding the headwind from the EHR incentive income, I think our base business can grow EBITDA in that 3% to 5% zone is something that we feel that is reasonable. And I think that's consistent with what we've been saying over the last several months.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: In your prepared remarks, you talked about seeing some pressure in the ER, specifically on lower-acuity stuff, while also mentioning expansion in the urgent care business. So if you don't mind just sharing your strategy and your views in that area. I mean, should we think about CareSpot as a market share capture strategy? Or is that a proactive push to get -- to move some of the lower-acuity or lowest-acuity volumes now to the ER going forward?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Brian, thank you and Sam, you want close it?
Samuel N. Hazen: Yes. I think one of fundamental aspects of our growth agenda is to ensure that we have adequate access to our system. And that includes a host of different capabilities, everything from emergency room capacity, as Richard mentioned, to physician clinics to other outpatient settings in locations that make it convenient and easy for patients to access an HCA system. We are exploring the concept of urgent care in a very substantial way to understand how it can fit into our overall network of offerings. CareSpot is in 2 markets, largely at this particular point in Nashville and Kansas City. We are studying the effects of that. It is intended to be more around creating access than it is to move patients necessarily from one setting or the other, although it does play a part in that approach. But we believe it's a convenient and efficient way for patients to get low-end care and then provide access to an HCA network if they need more substantial care or sophisticated care down the road. And so that will continue to evolve. We've studied that. We actually have another market, pediatric urgent care centers that are connected to our children's hospitals that serve a similar role. Additionally, we have many affiliations with urgent care centers in these major metropolitan markets that allow us to virtually expand our network. And HCA is the downstream health care system for some of the freestanding urgent care centers that exist in the market. So it's all again part of the core strategy of trying to create physician access to the system. And we will continue to study the effect of owning urgent care as opposed to affiliating and what that means to us as we move forward.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. With that, thank you. Brian, thank you for your question. I thank everyone for participating. And Mark and I will be around all day and look forward to seeing you soon. Have a great day.
Operator: And again, this does conclude today's HCA Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell: Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome everyone on today's call, as well as those of you listening on our webcast. With me here this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operations. And then we have a number of other members of our senior management team here as well to assist during the Q&A. Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. This morning's call is being recorded and a replay will be available later today. With that, let me turn the call over to Richard.
Richard M. Bracken: Okay. Thank you, Vic, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. Earlier this morning, the company reported its second quarter earnings results, which are in line with our purview of earnings release of July 16. Summary information concerning our second quarter performance was provided in today's release and will offer more detailed review of the second quarter performance in just a moment. But first, I want to comment on the announcement we issued Monday afternoon. In it, we indicated that at the end of this year, I'll retire from the role of CEO. But more importantly, that Milton Johnson, whom you all know is our President and Chief Financial Officer, will become CEO effective at that same time. Let me just say that we are most fortunate to have Milton not only ready, willing and able to accept this responsibility, but he will also bring to the position a comprehensive understanding of the industry and investor community, a long-term appreciation of HCA and our culture and a competitive drive and ethical character to lead our organization in the futures. My congratulations in advance to Milton, and I look forward to supporting him and the entire management team to the Chairman's role. Now a few general observations about the quarter. In short, we were pleased with the results of the second quarter. A modest increase in volumes, an increase in patient acuity and resultant revenues per visit, combined with an efficient cost structure, produced favorable results. Revenues increased 4.2% and adjusted EBITDA increased 7.6% compared to the same period of the prior year. Patient volumes for the second quarter, as expressed in same facility admissions, increased 1.3%, while same facility adjusted admissions increased 1.1%. Generally, if we adjusted the first quarter volumes for the leap year effect, second quarter volume growth rates are similar to the first quarter. More on volumes in just a moment. As I mentioned, we were able to achieve favorable earnings performance through a combination of improved service mix and, importantly, a significant improvement in our expense structure. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.8% over the prior year second quarter. As we discussed on our first quarter call, volumes began to slow in the second half of the first quarter, and when this trend was established, necessary steps were taken. The benefit of these management actions continued through the second quarter and assisted in producing our favorable results. Through the first half of 2013, our overall results are consistent with our internal plan. As Sam will discuss in a moment, our most recent data indicates that our market share trends remain favorable. We remain comfortable with our operating strategies and our significant focus on development of service line capacities and improvement of patient quality and service metrics. Relative to our asset profile, we have had some developments worth noting. Shortly after the end of the second quarter, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement for the purchase of 3 hospitals in the Tampa, St. Pete markets. This acquisition will add approximately 700 beds and approximately $225 million in annualized revenues to our Tampa market. Furthermore, and within the last week, we have opened 2 newly constructed hospitals in the growing suburbs of existing markets, 1 in Orlando and 1 in Salt Lake City. These new facilities that we are opening are smaller in comparison to our average hospital size and investment and will operate with an emphasis on outpatient services. We have 2 additional hospitals using the same design concept now under construction in the Houston and Fort Worth markets. Both are scheduled for completion in 2014. We believe this approach will be a capital efficient way to stay aligned with population growth centers and provide access to our more comprehensive networks. Also in the second quarter, we announced the acquisition of The Outsource Group. This is our first major acquisition for our Parallon enterprise. We believe this acquisition will be complementary to and augment the existing revenue cycle services provided by Parallon. Parallon now will be able to offer a full spectrum of services ranging from targeted point solutions to end-to-end full service revenue outsourcing for hospitals and physician organizations. A broader array of solutions now will be available to both Parallon and The Outsource Group's significant client base. We welcome the 1,400 new employees from The Outsource Group to our Parallon organization. And finally, regarding health care reform, there are no major developments to report since our last quarter, although we did find a few additional exchange contracts since our last call. Now, 90% of our hospitals are contracted with at least 1 exchange product, up from 85% as reported in the first quarter. We don't expect any material impact on HCA from the delay in implementation of the important mandate and as most provider organizations, we are developing our strategies to participate in the exchange enrollment process for the uninsured. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson: Thank you, and good morning to all. Let me begin my comments this morning by thanking Richard for his leadership and countless contributions to HCA success. I'm looking forward to our continued relationship as you transition to Chairman next year. I'm also grateful to our outstanding management teams across our markets and our corporate leadership team for their support. I understand the unique role HCA plays in the U.S. health care delivery system. I'm excited, as well as humbled, by the opportunity that lies ahead. As CEO, I will reinforce the mission and values of HCA, including our focus on improving patient experience and outcomes, while maintaining a culture of operational excellence and accountability for results. Now let's move to a discussion of the second quarter. I hope most of you have had a chance to review our second quarter earnings release issued this morning. Sam and I will provide some additional information regarding the second quarter results, and then we'll take your questions. We were extremely pleased with the second quarter results, which were the product of solid volumes, better than expected revenue unit growth attributable to increase in acuity and excellent expense management by operating management teams. As Richard mentioned, after the first 6 months of 2013, we are right on plan for the year. Of course, it hasn't been achieved exactly as expected, but after a difficult first quarter, we are now back on plan. Revenues in the second quarter increased to $8.45 billion, up 4.2% compared to the prior year second quarter driven by both volume increases and revenue per unit growth. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.689 billion compared to $1.569 billion in the second quarter of 2012. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 20% compared to 19.3% in the second quarter of 2012. Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. totaled $423 million, or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $391 million, or $0.85 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter volume trends were consistent with the first quarter after adjusting for the effect of leap year in the first quarter of 2012, with same facility admissions increasing 1.3% and same facility equivalent admissions increasing 1.1% as compared to last year second quarter. Our same facility medical admissions increased 1.8%, while same facility surgical admissions declined 0.6% compared to the prior year. During the second quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.9% and 2.3%, respectively. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 10% on a same facility basis and now represent 29.1% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 1.8% from the prior year, while same facility Medicaid equivalent admissions increased 2% compared to the prior year period. Same facility managed care and other admissions declined 1.4% in the second quarter, while same facility managed care and other equivalent admissions declined 2% compared to the prior year second quarter. In the second quarter, uninsured admissions increased 6.3% on a same facility basis compared to the prior year. Same facility uninsured admissions represent 8.1% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 7.7% in last year second quarter. Same facility emergency room visits increased 0.8% in the quarter. However, excluding the decline in pulmonary or flu-related volumes in the quarter, ER visits would have increased 2.6% over the prior year. Same facility surgeries increased 0.1% in the quarter, reflecting a 0.2% increase in our same facility inpatient surgeries, while our same facility outpatient surgeries were flat with the prior year. During the quarter, revenue per equivalent admission increased 2.9% on a same facility basis. This is partially due to an increase in our average length of stay in our case mix, a measure of inpatient acuity. Average length of stay increased 0.7% and the case mix index increased 1.6% compared to the prior year period. For the second quarter, higher Medicare case mix index helped to mitigate the approximately $30 million impact of the BCA sequester, resulting in a decline of 0.2% in same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission. Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission, excluding the Medicaid waiver programs, increased 6.3%. Medicaid case mix index increased 2.8% over the prior period. Managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission reflected solid growth at 6.1% over the prior year period. Managed care and other case mix index increased 2% over last year. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $461 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year. During the quarter, same facility charity care discounts totaled $796 million, an increase of $65 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $2.014 billion, an increase of $396 million from the prior year period. Now moving to expenses. Expense management was excellent in the second quarter. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased just 1.8% compared to the prior year. Excluding HITECH and the Medicaid waiver program expenses, same facility operating expense increased 2.6% in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the prior year period. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 1.8% on a same facility basis, and same facility productivity performance, as measured by man hours per equivalent admission, deteriorated 0.5% over the prior year period, and same facility wage rate growth was 1.5% in the second quarter. Personnel costs associated with physician employment increased $13 million, or 4.9% from the previous year second quarter. Noncash share-based compensation expense associated with the company's management equity plan increased $14 million in the quarter over last year second quarter. Same facility supply expense for equivalent admission increased 2% from the prior year period, primarily reflecting the reclassification of nonequity member administrative fees from our reduction in supply expense to revenues. The amount reclassified was approximately $37 million and contributed 260 basis points to the growth of supply expense per equivalent admission in the second quarter. The reclassification had no impact on the adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Same facility other operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.6% from the prior year period. We recognized $52 million in electronic health record and incentive income in the second quarter compared to $70 million in the second quarter of last year, and this is consistent with our expectations. The company also incurred approximately $33 million and $20 million in EHR-related expenses in the second quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities totaled $814 million in the quarter compared to $1.46 billion last year. The $646 million decline was primarily due to a favorable benefit in 2012 from a decline in accounts receivable of approximately $390 million, which included the receipt of $271 million related to the 2012 first quarter rural floor Medicare settlement. Also we paid $245 million in additional income tax payments in the current quarter compared to the prior year period. Days and accounts receivable for second quarter increased by 1 day to 53 days compared to 52 days at the end of the first quarter. At June 30, 2013, the company's debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.41x compared to 4.56x at March 31, 2013. Our exposure to floating rate debt is approximately 10% of our total debt. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.985 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities. Before turning the call to Sam, I want to mention Parallon's implementation that both supply chain and revenue cycle services for LifePoint Hospitals is proceeding well and according to plan. Now let me turn the call over to Sam.
Samuel N. Hazen: Good morning. I'll begin my comments this morning with more detail on the company's volume trends for the quarter and then provide an update on inpatient market share. 8 out 14 domestic divisions had growth in year-over-year same facility inpatient admissions. Our international division also had growth in inpatient admissions. 9 out of 14 domestic divisions and our international division had growth in same facility adjusted admissions. Overall, the growth inside our portfolio of domestic hospitals was similar to the first quarter. In the second quarter, 60% of our domestic hospitals had growth in inpatient admissions and 57% had growth in adjusted admissions. As Milton indicated, emergency room visits were soft in comparison to past trends. Only 6 out 14 domestic divisions had growth in emergency room visits. EMS transports to our hospitals were up almost 1%, with 8 out of 14 divisions growing. We have seen a general softness in the lower acuity emergency room business, and there has been some increased competition in a number of markets. We feel these 2 factors are part of the reasons for the slower growth rates. The company continues to invest significantly in the service line to increase accessing capacity, to improve operational efficiency and to enhance quality and service. All of this, we believe, positions us well from a competitive standpoint in today's market and into the future. Total surgeries for the company were up slightly in the quarter, with hospital-based surgeries up 1.1% on a same facility basis, and our ambulatory surgery division down 2.3%. This is a good improvement over the first quarter. Inside our ambulatory surgery division, overall cases, which include certain endoscopic and pain management procedures that are not counted in our surgery volumes, grew by 4% as a result of some recent acquisitions and new facility development. As indicated, acuity this past quarter was strong. Average length of stay in our adult and neonatal intensive care units was up 2.7%. This continues at similar trend we experienced in the first quarter. Behavioral services admissions were up 2.6%, and acute rehabilitation admissions were up 11.3% in the quarter. These metrics are generally consistent with the first quarter. And finally, deliveries were up 1 point -- up 1%, and the first quarter deliveries were down 1%. Now let me transition to some market share highlights for the 12 months ending December 2012. Once again, this is the most current data available for the company, and it represents almost 90% of the company's markets. First, the company's inpatient market share during 2012 increased 56 basis points to 23.7%. Overall, inpatient demand in our markets increased in 2012 by 0.4%. This is a slight weakening from 2011, which had market demand growth of 0.8%. Inpatient demand, however, in the fourth quarter of 2012, was up 1.1%, reflecting a busy flu season. Sequentially, market share increased in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. This follows sequential market share gains in each of the previous 5 quarters. We gained market share in 14 out of 17 service lines. HCA had market share gains in 29 out of 37 markets, with growth in 9 of our top 10 earnings markets. Market share in both the commercial and in migration segments of our business grew, reflecting continued success with our outreach efforts in these 2 distinct markets. Across all of these market share metrics, the company's trends are generally consistent with past reports. This pattern reflects solid execution of our growth agenda. As you already heard, expense management in the second quarter was very strong. Our management teams executed very effectively. We will remain focused in the last half of the year on the same areas that we shared with you during our first quarter earnings call and we believe these efforts should put us in a good position to maintain our cost structure in the last 2 quarters of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell: All right, thanks, Sam. All right, now I'd like to for you to come back on, encourage everyone, as we always do, to try to hold your questions to just one at a time so that everyone has an opportunity. With that, Noah?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Can you give us an update, there's been a ton of news on public M&A recently, 2 deals announced. But even outside that, just wanted to get your thoughts on what the M&A pipeline looks like and if you had a chance to evaluate any of these deals and your thoughts on them?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Milt, do you want to address that?
R. Milton Johnson: Sure. I don't think we should address comments on the M&A activity in the public traded market right now as those transactions are still ongoing and incomplete. But overall, as Richard mentioned, we have signed some agreements to pursue acquisitions in our existing markets, we like that approach, they help round out in existing markets, improve our position in markets. We have transactions that are pending, subject to regulatory approval in both Kansas City and, as Richard mentioned this morning, in Tampa. We're looking at some other opportunities that would be similar. Too early to tell whether those will work out and lead to an agreement. But we are actively pursuing acquisitions in the markets where it makes sense to us. We think that's a strategy that we will continue and excited about the opportunities. But as you all know, those opportunities for acquisitions tend to come and go in the marketplace at a certain pace. And we certainly are tuned to the market and looking forward to participating where it makes sense to us.
Richard M. Bracken: I just add -- this is Richard. I would just add that we still think that given health care reform and over the longer view that there will be consolidation in the industry, we think our platform allows us to participate very efficiently in that process. As we've said many times in the past, we are disciplined about where we acquire, how we acquire. And so, that will be our thinking as we assess possibilities. The pipeline, specifically to your question, is unpredictable. It happens when it happens. We generally are aware of most things that are going on in the marketplace and consider them. But short of that, we are pleased with our efforts to date. We add that to a strong position where there's organic growth in markets, and we think we have a pretty good growth story going forward.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk to the improved earnings from a geographic perspective, if any markets jumped out. And maybe, specifically, comment on Las Vegas. There's been some discussion that that’s starting to sees an improvement? And I guess the last part of my first question is that in Vegas, if there's any thoughts around renewed discussions with the largest commercial payor there?
Victor L. Campbell: Sam, do you want Vegas?
Samuel N. Hazen: Yes, there was more than one question there. Let me start with the geographic performance of the company. We had a very balanced performance across the organization. We had many markets that performed better than planned. So for the most part, the performance across the portfolio in general was very balanced, with most markets accomplishing what we had hoped they would accomplish in the second quarter. We had a few markets where there were some struggles. But they weren't material, and we were able to overcome those with the ones that did perform well. It's important to understand, for HCA, Las Vegas represents maybe 5% of the company's earnings. And so from that standpoint, it's an important market, yes, but it's not a market that dictates the overall performance of the company. Having said that, Las Vegas performance this year and last year has been very strong for HCA. We have seen reasonable market share gains over the time period. I think in 2012, we picked up decent market share in Las Vegas and our financial performance has been solid because of a very disciplined approach given the economic pressures that exist in that market and some of the underfunding that exist within the Medicaid program. As it relates to the largest payor, as a routine, we do have discussions with them. We haven't at this particular point in time, reached any agreement that would reestablish relationships between HCA and Sierra inside of that market, but we do have ongoing discussions given our long tenured relationship with them.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: In terms of reform, just curious if you have any updated thoughts, I know you said nothing major changed in terms of exchange contracts and whatnot, but just updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the benefits as we look out, I guess, either specifically or directionally in sort of the ramp that you're thinking at this stage of the game? And when you might think that you're going to give us any more specifics on that topic?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Thanks, Tom. I think Milton is going to address that.
R. Milton Johnson: Sure. Well, as Richard said, it's really not a lot of change in our outlook since last quarter. I'll maybe describe it this way, the uncertainty of health care reform, there's 2 main drivers where we still have a great deal of uncertainty. One, and to your question, what's going to be the ramp-up or the uptake on health care reform? In other words, how many -- at what rate and how many of the uninsured will sign up for coverage in the exchanges. That's a significant uncertainty for us. And then second, of those that do come into the marketplace and go into the exchange, how many will recapture? What would be our market share in the exchange? Are the payors which we have contracts with, how successful will those contracts be in capturing share? Those are 2 main drivers, of course, of health care reform impact on HCA, and we need some more time to try to get some clarification around that impact. And once we have that, I think we will factor that in. And as far as timing, right now, we want to keep flexibility with respect to the timing. Only we plan to give guidance on the health care reform impact. But right now, I would say, it would be no later, we think, than when we give guidance for 2014, which is expected most likely to be in February of 2014.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Zimmerman with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: To be able to hit your same-store equivalent admission guidance number of 1% to 2%, you need to see a bit of a pickup in the back half of the year to offset the weaker volumes we saw in Q1. How confident are you that you're going to be able to see that pickup in the back half of the year?
Victor L. Campbell: Milton, do you want to address that as well?
R. Milton Johnson: Sure. Good observation there. Although we're still -- we are reaffirming our guidance and, as I said, we are on plan with respect to our EBITDA guidance. With respect to the details of how we may arrive there, now that we're halfway through the year, I think that it's more likely that our adjusted admission growth for the year will be somewhere around 1% versus previously, I think, we'd guided or given details somewhere around 2%. Here it's halfway through the year, we're up 0.3%. And as I think about the overall revenue growth, I still think we'll be in that 3% to 5%, 3% to 4.5%, 3% to 5% zone as we stated before, because I expect that our net revenue per adjusted admission growth rate will also be higher than we first thought. We -- in May, we said it would be 2% to 3% on our call. Now I'm thinking more likely in the 2.5% to 3.5% sort of growth rate, making up the shortfall from the change in outlook on our volume growth. Year-to-date, we are about -- we're at 3.6% growth. That excludes, of course, the 2012 rural floor settlement out of the first quarter of last year in that growth rate. And then we still think our expenses for the year will come in, in that 3% to 3.5% sort of zone. In the first quarter, our expense growth, excluding HITECH expenses, grew 4.8%, and we're up 2.6% here in the second quarter. And that averages out to about 3.7%. So we still think our expense targets of 3% to 3.5% for the year is still reasonable targets. So our revenue, total top line revenue outlook is still the same in that 3% to 5% zone. But getting there, a little bit different mix between volume and revenue growth than we talked about in May.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just want to get a little more color on the exchange contract, I appreciate the color to 90% from 95% with 1 contract. But in the past you talked about the number of markets that have more than 1 contract, and going back to your point before about one of the unknowns being how much of that incremental coverage you will capture within your facilities, what is a good number of contracts to have in a given market as you think about it? Is one going to be sufficient? Is there a goal to get a certain number more than one in most markets?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Kevin, I'm going to ask Juan Vallarino, I don't -- we really don't have the stats down because the numbers didn't change a whole lot from the previous quarter when we sort of walked through how many markets and contracts, whatever. And we sort of looked at that and, I'd say, no material change there other than 85% of our hospitals with the contract. We are at 90%. But Juan Vallarino is not here at Nashville, but I think he's on an outside line. Juan, you just want to share anything that you can because there's not a lot of specifics.
Juan Vallarino: Sure. Kevin, good question. Honestly, more contract is better in any market. I think the first year of the exchange, you are not going to know a whole lot so premiums get published from the health plans. The plans that you do have business with where they lie in terms with premiums as opposed to their competitors. And to date, only 2 of the states where we do visits in their published premiums. And they're still both under review. So we know very little today as anybody else both on the planning side or the hospital side about the potential grab of market share in the exchange. So right now, it's really a wait and see and try to get more contracts but knowing that their premiums are set already.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Just wanted to change gears a bit and find out what's the latest thinking on capital deployment. Obviously, some M&A and development going on, but just bigger picture, what you're thinking about doing with your cash over the balance of the year?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Richard and Milt, you want to handle that one?
Richard M. Bracken: I wouldn't think that our position has changed from what we have shared with you in the past. We take a look at our cash flow and obviously after our CapEx, I will say this, we do see opportunities for perhaps increasing our CapEx sum. There are a lot of opportunities for growth within our markets. And we are evaluating those as we speak. So I do think there's some opportunity for some CapEx increases as we go forward. We continue to obviously, as you mentioned, to rate strategic acquisitions as a very high priority use. And as we just mentioned, we've been doing that. And then of course the other uses of cash are to be considered after those 2. And I really don't see that lineup changing anytime soon.
Operator: We'll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Richard, I want to wish you the best in the future. Obviously, we have one more quarter with you, but do that, and also congratulations to Milton. Just to pick up on Milton's sort of walk-through to the back half of the year. Obviously, the 2 variables that have changed since your original guidance seemed like to me to be favorable are the cost-cutting efforts you put in place in -- at the end of Q1. I guess I'm curious whether that's fully reflected at this point in Q2 or would there be some residual benefits that will kick into Q3 that may make that walk forward seem a little conservative? And then I guess you had the DSH proposal as well come out more favorable, and I don't know what you think that will look like in the final rule, if you that any insight, I guess, will get that any day here, but that would -- those 2 would seem to suggest that analysis might have some upside to it. Is there any comment on that?
Victor L. Campbell: Let me do the DSH and then I'll let these guys talk about the cost-cutting and how it rolls, Sam, you probably want to do that. I think DSH, we know what you know. We've seen the proposed rule, and we would expect the final rule very soon within the next few days. But we know nothing more than that, and we'll wait until we see a final.
Samuel N. Hazen: AJ, it's Sam. I think the company moved really timely in the first quarter of making adjustments once we sense that volumes weren't where they were going to be. And most of those efforts around our adjustments to costs were accomplished in the first quarter and benefited the second quarter. There's -- were some residual efforts that occurred throughout the second -- part of the second quarter, if you will, that will have some incremental benefit as we move forward. Again, our cost performance depends heavily on our volume, and as we achieve where we think our volumes are going to be, as Milton indicated, we believe the cost structure is in a pretty good position. Having said that, we have a host of cost initiatives across the company that can produce some incremental value month in and month out and they're centered around supply chain initiatives, ongoing sharing of best practices through our process improvement teams, clinical excellence initiatives that yield improvements in performance across the company. So those things continue to yield value and will bleed in as those initiatives get executed. But for the most part, the substantial adjustments that we needed to make were accomplished in the first quarter. And we won't see the same kind of adjustments today that we had at that point in time.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So you guys mentioned in your plan to participate in enrolling patients in exchange of the Medicaid. Can you provide us maybe some more details on your strategy around that, are you going to formalize it by being an affixer or a navigator, maybe just remind us of how successful you guys are, generally, today in enrolling people in Medicaid and maybe even high risk goals?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Andrew, thank you. Eric Ward who is with Parallon. Eric, do you want to talk a little bit about that?
Eric Ward: Sure. Today, our process for enrolling patients in Medicaid is a combination of in-company resources and vendor resources. As we move forward into the future with the exchanges, we continue to think we're going to use both resources from an outsource perspective and insource perspective to enroll people in the exchanges. We're working with our vendors today and are monitoring to see where we need to go in the future.
Victor L. Campbell: If I could add. We have a pretty successful component of conversion today. I mean, we monitor our conversions on Medicaid very closely. We benchmark against our vendors. And we think those lessons will apply as we move through exchange enrollment as well. And Eric and his team have a very robust set of metrics and systems underneath all of those efforts that give us confidence that we can use those same approaches, and hopefully, get the same kind of results as we move through the exchange. The difference though is you get retroactive approvals on Medicaid. We don't think we'll be able to get retroactive approvals on the exchange.
Richard M. Bracken: And let me just add. This is Richard. As we think about enrolling folks in the exchanges, there certainly is crossover with the skill set of the employees that are enrolling people in Medicaid as we speak. And so, as we look forward, there's opportunities to be, what's that, a training organization. We're certainly interested in that, so that we can use existing employee resources when we in-source to not only do Medicaid, but to do the exchange products or to the HCA and then also outsource where we need to supplement. So we think we have a pretty good plan. This is all developed -- this is in process as we speak right now and really will unfold over the next 30 to 60 days.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Crédit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Want to go back to the volume side of things. Can you share any opinion you have on just the overall environment? We've seen more pronounced volatility between, certainly, at least the publicly traded group over the last several quarters. I guess do you have any sense or take on kind of the urban versus rural characteristics, volatility between markets and just general landscape? And along those lines, it will be helpful to get your take on a long-term basis, just remind us what you -- what kind of same facility revenue growth you think you can achieve and the underlying EBITDA growth that would translate to, maybe extra form.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Ralph, that was pretty good, 1 question, became at least 3. I'm not sure we get to that last one anytime on this call, but you want to start out, we'll just talk about volume, Sam.
Samuel N. Hazen: Yes. I think one thing, and we've said this for years and we still believe that it's relevant to the discussion is that HCA has a unique portfolio of markets where it does business. And when you look at population trends and you look at the economic performance of this market, it's unique, I think, across the industry. And that's part of why we believe we have maybe different volume metrics in some respects than others. Having said that, we think our organic growth strategies are effective in yielding market share gains as we've talked about with a pretty strong market share gain performance over the past few years, and so there's execution also that we believe is yielding some inherent growth. As it relates to the urban, rural, the only point of reference I can give you is we monitor what we call the in-migration of business from the rural markets into these major metropolitan markets. And that segment of our business is the fastest-growing segment of admission activity on the inpatient side. The composite growth in 2012 was actually 2.8%. And as I indicated, for 2012, overall inpatient demand was only 0.4%. So you can see that at least in rural markets surrounding HCA's urban markets, there is a growing in-migration volume that's taking place, and that's why we're so focused on rural outreach in efforts to affiliate with rural providers to drive growth for HCA. I don't remember the other questions, Vic.
Victor L. Campbell: I think that was the primary one. And Milton, I don't know if you want to talk x reform, how we're looking at it.
R. Milton Johnson: Well, just -- let me just maybe look where we are year to date, there's some moving parts in the numbers. Let me just kind of real quickly walk-through and kind of get down to what we think is a normalized EBITDA growth, at least where we are through the first 6 months. So on a reported basis, all in, our EBITDA is down 4%. Where this year, you were at $3.257 billion for the first 6 months versus last year at $3.392 billion. But of course last year, we had the favorable rural floor settlement that was a net $170 million in EBITDA. If you back that out, then we're actually up 1.1% for the first 6 months. And then, if you consider HITECH, the impact of our HITECH income and expenses impact from EBITDA, so we've got less revenue from HITECH as you know in the first 6 months of this year and we had spent a little bit more on HITECH expenses rolling out the program this year. The net effect on EBITDA is that this time last year, we had a drag of -- I'm sorry, an impact of $88 million positive this time last year because of the HITECH revenue. And this year, we have a positive impact of $32 million into EBITDA. So if you normalize that, we're 3.3% up. And so, we're in that kind of low to mid single-digit range, which is kind of where we expected when you normalize for these moving parts, HITECH and the Medicare adjustment.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I'd like to go back to the commentary around ER volumes, a little bit of softness there. Could you go back and explain a little bit about what you saw there? I think you may have said increased competition for lower acuity services, just wanted to clarify on that. And then any commentary on the geography of that trend in ER volumes and does it mirroring the rural hospital volumes?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Sam, would you like to take that from Frank?
Samuel N. Hazen: We look at our ER business inside of the different levels of acuity. And we've talked about some of the acuity levels in past calls. And when we look at our business -- and really the first half of this year, but in particular, the second quarter of 2013, we actually had a decline in the lower level, the lowest levels of acuity, and that was fairly broad-based across the company. But we did have slower rates of growth in the other levels of ER volume, except for our most acute component of the ER business where we actually had faster rates of growth there than we had in the first 6 months of the last year as a comparison. When we look at the geography for our performance, we performed better in Florida, in the East Florida and West Florida in particular, on emergency room business. We think the tourist business in Florida has been stronger this year than in the past, and that's part of the explanation, but we do have a very robust emergency room growth plan across most of our markets. And that's yielding reasonable growth in other parts of the country. For example, in California, last year we struggled with emergency room activity. This year, we're actually having a very strong level of performance in the emergency rooms in California. There are increased competitors in both the urgent care space, as well as the emergency room space in a lot of our markets, whether that's coming from hospitals or freestanding entities, and we think that is yielding some pressure on the overall demand in this particular area. Having said that, we're still very bullish on our emergency room strategy. We believe there are opportunities to continue to differentiate in the market and gain market share and be a key part of access to the HCA system. And we're investing in capacity. In certain markets, we are investing in different sites. In certain markets, we are adding program capabilities across the company with trauma and stroke capabilities, which are important to other aspects of our business. We reach out very effectively with our EMS partners and work to resolve their problems. So we've got a lot going on in this area, and we still believe it's going to be a very needed service across a lot of our markets. And we don't know if this is a trend yet. It could be. But we think the aspects of this business will continue to yield solid growth, and we don't want to take our eye off the ball off this area.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Maybe go back on some of the questions around volumes. Is there any way to quantify the impact, if any, that new services or changes in service lines had on same-store admissions?
Victor L. Campbell: Sam, do you want to?
Samuel N. Hazen: I'm not sure exactly, Gary, what specific certifications you're talking about. I think that's such an ongoing effort with our facilities to gain accreditation where we meet certain quality standards and community standards. And that does have an impact, and that's a very good process for us because it forces discipline around performance and outcomes and so forth. But given that, that's happening on such a routine, I don't think it's incrementally changing the volume trends within the company. There are certain service lines where we add capacity and we do it and add capability because we don't have that service in a particular market, I'll use Nashville as an example. Our network in Nashville is very solid with geographical positioning and general capabilities. But a few years ago, we felt we did not have the full array of services to really accomplish what we wanted to accomplish as a network. And we've added more substantial children services, as an example. We're just opening up a level 2 trauma program, and that helps to round out the overall array of services in our market here in Nashville and makes us more competitive with respect to payors. It also attracts higher capability from a specialty standpoint. It really enhances our position in the communities. So those things are going on in multiple markets across the company and are incrementally there. But I wouldn't say they substantially change the overall performance of the company's volume metrics.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I wanted to ask just about the hospitals that you're opening. You made the comment of just about the design with a little bit more focus on outpatient and a smaller inpatient footprint, I guess, is the implied comment there. And maybe just stepping back if you could give us a sense for what that might mean for your capital plan going forward and your existing hospital base. Obviously, you've done a lot over time to configure your hospitals. But might we see a little bit of a different shift in how you're spending and how does that play into CapEx over the next couple of years?
Samuel N. Hazen: Let me speak to the size of the hospitals and then someone else could jump in here on the capital as we need to fill. This is Sam again. These hospitals are in demographics in major metropolitan markets where there are opportunities to introduce an HCA facility and round out our network. As Richard mentioned, we usually start out with 40 to 60 beds, inpatient beds, as an example. And typically, you will see a younger population in these markets. So they're not demanding as much inpatient health care as you might in a market where there's a different kind of demographic. And so we'll start out with basic services on the outpatient areas, clearly emergency room capability, outpatient surgery, a lot of imaging, and then we'll have a lot of women services in those facilities because they're connected to a younger population and in our obstetric service line and so forth. But what's important is that they now are connected to a larger network and when there's a need for more sophisticated or tertiary service, we can work with our physicians and our other hospitals to transfer patients to more tertiary level hospitals and deliver the services that those folks need. Then over time, it grows. We add beds, we add services, we bring in new physicians, and we start to get the certifications that we just spoke about, and we put ourselves in a position where it becomes a much more substantial hospital, and they move to different levels of capability over time. And that life cycle can vary, it can be 10 years in some cases, it can be 5 in very unique cases. But it's typically a 10 to 20 years kind of cycle where these hospitals will move into a much more sophisticated level. But as it relates to these networks, they're very complementary and very helpful to rounding out those capabilities. And in addition to the 2 that Richard mentioned that are under construction, we're evaluating 2 to 3 other ones that we think make sense for us, and we will weave those into our capital plan as appropriate once we get through the due diligence on those analysis.
Richard M. Bracken: And I would just add that I wouldn't expect this to change the overall sort of distribution of how we spend our capital. We have had large projects come through the system in the past. They take different forms as they work their way through. But for the most part, I wouldn't see this as dramatically shifting the distribution of how we spend money within the company. We generally think of it sort of a facility percentage, a technology percentage. And with the one exception, I would think that perhaps, and as we mentioned on the Parallon acquisition, no, not particularly a CapEx comment, but we do see more opportunities around that space and cap investment in that space where we haven't, historically. So I just think maybe that's where it might shift some but not overall distribution.
R. Milton Johnson: I'll make this one last comment to wrap up. We have a very good process and discipline around our capital allocation process. Sam and Jon Foster and Chuck Hall operating teams are, of course, heavily involved in that. And one thing I think that we have done very well over recent years is being able to match our capital spending with capacity and growth opportunities. And I think our process is very good around that. It's flexible maybe to your point, depending on market dynamics. And going forward, I expect we'll continue to be very flexible and take advantage of the market opportunities.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Everyone, I thank everyone on the call. I know Mark is here all day, and I'll be around. So give us a call if you need anything. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA First Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and instructions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning to everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today's call, including those listening to our webcast. With us here this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operation. Several other members of the senior management team are here as well to assist during the Q&A session. Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statement, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. This morning's call is being recorded. Replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Richard.
Richard M. Bracken: Thanks, Vic, and good morning to all, and thank you for joining our call. Today, the company reported first quarter earnings, which are in line with our pre-released expectations provided in our April 15 preview. Summary information concerning our first quarter performance was provided in our release this morning. And in just a moment, we'll provide a more detailed review of our first quarter performance. However, before we proceed to these analyses, let me provide a few general observations about the quarter. As we identified in our releases, one of the most significant observations for the quarter was the slowing of patient volume growth from our recent trends. Growth in same facility inpatient admissions for the quarter was up only slightly at 0.1%, well below our historical trends. And, of course, from a more meaningful comparison, this rate needs to be adjusted for the leap year effect -- that is 1 less day as compared to last year's first quarter. Doing so, same facility inpatient admissions for the quarter grew by 1.3%. Even though this rate has improved from the as-reported number, clearly, it was less than our recent trends. It should be noted that this is a slowdown in rate of growth also occurred in our outpatient volumes as reflected in our adjusted admissions performance. Our analysis of first quarter volume related metrics has led us to the following general conclusions: The slowdown in inpatient volumes began mid-quarter with January's as-reported same facility admissions up 4.7%, February's down 3.6% and March's down 0.9%. Regardless of day alignment issues, performance clearly was challenged most in the month of February, and we did see some modest improvement sequentially in March. The slower volume growth was felt across our portfolio of hospitals. However, it is interesting to note that roughly the same number of facilities did experience admissions growth in the quarter as compared to recent trends, but the growth that they did experience was generally less. And finally the slowdown in volumes was experienced across all payer classes and service lines. And Sam will provide more analysis of our Q1 volume metrics in just a moment. Please note that we feel we're not in a position at this time to state definitively if the slowdown of volumes we saw in the second half of the first quarter is an anomaly or if it's just a start of a new trend. Additional time must pass to make this determination. Also, while typically we don't comment on current quarter metrics, given the volume issues in the first quarter, we thought it important to point out today that April's inpatient volumes, with the benefit of an additional business day, increased approximately 4% over prior year. This is more consistent with our expectations. While our operating teams managed expense levels with the reduced volumes during the quarter, we maintain our investments in our service line strategies, technology and clinical improvement agendas. And we feel these investments are necessary for sustained growth over time. And finally, as expected, this was a quarter with a significant amount of contracting activity for health exchange products. During the quarter, we have been in conversation with most every major payer in most every market. Our approach to exchange contracting has factored in assumptions, such as anticipated participation by individuals and exchange products, Medicaid expansion activities, uninsured market share and hospital occupancy rates, to mention just a few. Our results today are as follows: Generally, we negotiate with health plans across roughly 37 markets. To date, in 27 of those markets, we have 36 contracts with our major payers and expect to be in active negotiations for additional contracts over the next several months. Currently, 85% of our hospitals are contracted with at least 1 exchange product. We have 17 -- we have contracts in 17 of our 20 largest uninsured markets. And in 9 markets, we will participate in multiple exchange products. Of the 36 contracts, 16 include some form of network configuration. And although we are not going to comment on the specific rates associated with executed contracts, they generally can be characterized as closer to commercial pricing than Medicare. And in some cases, exchange contracts had been coupled with term extensions of other managed care agreements that we might have with any given payer. As I stated on our last quarter's call, we believe this will be a process that evolves over time. Although we are still in the early stages of America's reform agenda, the exchange contracting results to date have been within our expectations. We are encouraged by the dialogue we have had with the payer community and believe that exchange products, over time, will create value for our organization. And finally, yesterday, HCA signed an asset purchase agreement with Carondelet Health to purchase their 2 hospitals, St. Joseph and St. Mary's Medical Centers in Kansas City. We are pleased with the execution of this agreement and are looking forward to adding these organizations to our company. And with that, let me turn the call over to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson: Thank you, and good morning. I hope most of you have had a chance to review our first quarter earnings release issued this morning. Sam and I will provide some additional information regarding the first quarter results and then we'll take your questions. As Richard mentioned, our first quarter results fell short of our internal expectations, primarily due to lower patient volumes, especially outpatient volumes. Cash expenses also came in well below plan due to less volume and management actions taken in the quarter. However, we were not able to fully offset the revenue impact of the volume softness with expense management. Following my comments, Sam will provide additional observations on patient volume and management's actions. Revenues in the first quarter increased to $8.44 billion, up 0.4% compared to the prior year's first quarter. Excluding the net favorable Medicare settlements in the first quarter of 2012 of $188 million, revenues increased 2.7% over the prior year's first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.568 billion compared to $1.823 billion in the first quarter of 2012, which included a net favorable impact from the Medicare settlements of $170 million. Net income attributable to HCA Holdings Inc. totaled $344 million or $0.74 per diluted share compared to $540 million or $1.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. First quarter of 2013 results include pretax losses from the sales of facilities of $16 million or $0.02 per diluted share. The first quarter also includes a pretax loss of $17 million or $0.03 per diluted share on the retirement of the $201 million principal amount of our 9 7/8% senior secured second lien notes due in 2017. Volume trends in the quarter moderated from recent growth rates with same facility admissions increasing 0.1% and same facility equivalent admissions declining 0.7% as compared to last year's first quarter. Our same facility medical admissions increased 1.2%, while same facility surgical admissions declined 3.2% compared to the prior year. Excluding the extra business day due to leap year in 2012, our same facility admissions increased 1.3% and same facility equivalent admissions increased 0.4%. During the first quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 1.5% and 1%, respectively. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased to 12.5% on a same-facility basis and represent 28.9% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions were flat with prior year, while same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.2% compared to the prior year. Same facility managed care and other admissions declined 3.2% in the first quarter, while same facility managed care and other equivalent admissions declined 4.6% compared to the prior year's first quarter. In the first quarter, uninsured admissions increased 5.4% on a same facility basis compared to the prior year. Same facility uninsured admissions represent 7.4% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 7% in last year's first quarter. Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.8% in the quarter. Excluding the leap year effect, same facility emergency visits increased 4.9%. Same facility surgeries declined 3.6% in the quarter, reflecting a decline of 2.6% in our same facility inpatient surgeries and a 4.3% decline in our same facility outpatient surgeries. Adjusting for leap year, same facility inpatient surgeries declined 1.5% and outpatient surgeries declined 3.2% compared to the prior year's first quarter. During the quarter, revenue rate growth per equivalent admission improved compared to recent trends. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 0.8% in the first quarter. However, excluding the impact of the net favorable Medicare settlement in 2012, revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.5%. This is partially due to an increase in our average length of stay and our case mix, a measure of inpatient acuity, which increased 2.4% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to the prior-year period. For the first quarter, same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission declined 3.7%. However, after excluding the Medicare settlement revenue from the prior period 2012, Medicare revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.6%. Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission, excluding the Medicaid waiver programs, increased 0.4%. Managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.5% over the prior year period, the highest quarterly growth rate yield on our managed care revenue in several quarters. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $418 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year. During the first quarter, same facility charity care discounts totaled $905 million, an increase of $108 million from the prior year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $1.947 billion, an increase of $310 million from the prior year period. Now moving to expenses. As I mentioned earlier, cash expenses came in well below plan, but on a volume-adjusted basis, growth rates were greater than recent trends, primarily due to the moderation in volume growth. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 4.3% compared to the prior year. Same facility operating expense, excluding HITECH expenses and Medicaid waiver program expenses, increased 4.8% in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the prior year. As I referenced earlier in my comments regarding our revenue rate growth, higher case mix and average length of stay also contributed to the growth in operating expense per equivalent admission. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 4.1% on a same facility basis. Same facility productivity performance as measured by man hours per equivalent admission deteriorated 1.8% over the prior year period and same facility wage growth was 2% in the first quarter. Personnel costs associated with physician employment increased by $9 million of 3.3% from the previous year's first quarter. Noncash share-based compensation expense associated with the company's management equity plan increased $14 million in the quarter over last year's first quarter. Same facility supply expense per equivalent admission increased 4.6% from the prior period, primarily reflecting the reclassification of nonequity member administrative fees from a reduction and supply expense to revenues. The amount reclassified was approximately $41 million and contributed 290 basis points to the growth of supply expense per equivalent admission in the first quarter. The reclassification had no impact on adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Same facility other operating expense per equivalent admission increased 4.6% from the prior period -- prior year period. We recognized $39 million in electronic health record incentive income in the first quarter compared to $55 million in the first quarter of last year. This is consistent with our expectations. The company also incurred approximately $26 million and $17 million in EHR-related expense in the first quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities totaled $740 million in the quarter compared to $797 million last year. The decline was primarily due to the net impact of the $201 million less in net income, being partially offset by $50 million benefit from changes in working capital items and $50 million benefit from income taxes in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. Days in accounts receivable at the end of the first quarter were 52 days compared to 53 days for the same period last year. At March 31, 2013, the company's debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.56x compared to 4.43x at December 31, 2012. And at the end of the quarter, we had $2.575 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities. We are in the process of repricing certain of our bank term loans. We recently closed on the repricing of our $2.373 billion Term Loan B3, which has a maturity of May 1, 2018, and reduced the credit spread on that loan from 325 basis points to 275 basis points. This will reduce our interest expense by $11.9 million annually over the life of the loan. Additionally, we are currently in the process of repricing our $2 billion Term Loan B2, which has a maturity of March 31, 2017, and expect to reduce the credit spread on that loan from 325 basis points to 275 points as well. This repricing, if successfully completed, will reduce our interest expense by $10 million annually over the life of the loan. I do want to spend just a moment addressing the Medicare IPPS proposed rule, which was issued by CMS last Friday afternoon. As you recall, on our fourth quarter call, we had sized a potential reduction in our Medicare disproportionate share payments under the Affordable Care Act starting in October 2013 of approximately $50 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 or $200 million annually. The proposed rule issued last week utilized what we believe is a more appropriate DSH reallocation formula, which will result in Medicare DSH payments at approximately the same level as this year. Also, the proposed rule reduces inpatient payments for the government's fiscal year beginning October 1, 2013, by 0.8% related to a documentation and coding recruitment adjustment in accordance with the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which was passed on New Year's Eve. During our prior call, we estimated this payment reduction at approximately $25 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 or $100 million on an annual basis. Under the proposed rule, our documentation and coding recruitment cut would be approximately $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 or approximately $52 million on an annual basis. I do want to remind everyone that this is still a proposed rule, not a final rule, which we anticipate would be published sometime in August. Before turning the call over to Sam, I want to mention that Parallon exceeded first quarter expectations, and the implementation of LifePoint Hospitals for both supply chain and revenue cycle services is proceeding according to plan. Now let me turn the call over to Sam.
Samuel N. Hazen: Good morning. I want to focus my comments this morning on the analysis we conducted on our first quarter volumes and the observations we are able to make at this point in time. Before I get into this, I want to give you a short summary of the 2012 third quarter market share performance for ATA. This summary is for the 12 months ended September 30, 2012, which is the most recent market share data available. For this period, inpatient market share for ATA increased to 23.5%, an improvement of 58 basis points over the previous year. Overall, inpatient demand in our markets was flat on a year-over-year basis. We had share gains in 14 out of 17 service lines. The company gained share in 29 out of 37 markets, with gains in 8 of its top 10 markets. In the commercial segment, market share grew by 38 basis points. And finally, within the in-migration segment of our business, market share improved by 53 basis points. During this 12-month period, the gains in the third quarter of 2012 accelerated, as compared to the other quarters in the study. Now let me move to the first quarter volumes. We conducted a thorough analysis of the 5 major factors that drive our volumes to see if we could identify any significant issues that would indicate an adverse change in market share performance. In short, we could not. As is typical, there were situations in a few markets where we believe our market share declined in the quarter, but there were also situations in other markets where we are confident that we gained share. The factors that we evaluated were as follows: First, we evaluated our managed care network contracts. There were no changes in our managed care contracts that reduced our access to commercial or governmental business, nor do we believe managed care companies are steering their business away from HCA facilities. To date, HCA has contracted for approximately 60% of 2014 managed care revenue and 40% of 2015 managed care revenue at rates consistent with the past few years. The second factor that we analyzed was the number of physicians on our active medical staff. In the first quarter, the number grew by almost 1% as compared to the end of the last year. This is consistent with past periods. The company continues to invest significantly in its physician integration initiatives and in its clinical improvement initiatives. The third factor we assessed was our core operations and organizational efforts that support our growth agenda. For example, we studied the average wait times in HCA emergency rooms. They were essentially identical to those in the fourth quarter. Our outreach resources and efforts were as planned, so there were no indications of problems in these areas of our evaluation. The fourth factor we reviewed was a portfolio performance analysis for our domestic operations, which we adjusted to reflect the effects of leap year. In 2012, 69% of our hospitals had growth in inpatient admissions. In the first quarter of 2013, 62% of our hospitals had growth. There was a slight weakening overall, but it was not material, nor was it concentrated in a particular market. To give you some perspective on the trends across the company's markets, the only state among our top 15 volume states that had a positive relationship between first quarter growth rates and 2012 growth rates in inpatient admissions was California. The growth rates in both Florida and Texas decelerated at a comparable level. When we conducted the same portfolio analysis for adjusted admissions, it is clear that the trends in outpatient volumes changed the most. In 2012, 77% of our hospitals had growth in adjusted admissions. In the first quarter of 2013, only 56% of our hospitals had growth in adjusted admissions. The final factor we analyzed was our competitors' actions. In general, there were no changes identified that would have caused an overall trend change for the company. There were a few specific markets where certain investments by our competition related to new hospitals had an adverse impact on our volumes, but these situations were limited and not broad based. As a result of this analysis, we believe the first quarter calendar changes related to leap year, Easter and New Year, had a pronounced effect on our volumes and explain much of the deceleration in growth. In particular, outpatient surgery volumes, outpatient diagnostic volumes and to a lesser degree, commercial admissions were most affected by this calendar change. Most of these volumes are generated on weekdays. Also, our behavioral and rehab businesses tend to be more weekdays oriented. The growth rate in these service lines slowed in the first quarter also. With respect to expense management, the company started responding to soft volume trends in late February. These efforts were accelerated in early March when it became apparent that the trends were not improving. Our actions included appropriate flexing of variable staffing and reductions in the use of premium labor. In certain situations, we reduced our workforce with more permanent measures. And finally, the company has redoubled its efforts to limit overhead additions, postpone certain initiatives and restrict discretionary spending. Our management teams have been very effective in the past with implementing these type of measures and we are confident in our ability to execute. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell: All right, Sam, thank you. And if we can move to Q&A, Jessica, you want to come back on?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Justin Lake with JPMorgan.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So question on exchange contracting. Can you talk specifically about Blue Cross Blue Shield contracting given the expectation they're likely to have significant market share on exchanges? And then you also said your rates look more like commercial than Medicare. As a level set, can you tell us how your current commercial rates compare to Medicare on average?
Victor L. Campbell: Milton, you want to lead and then, Juan?
R. Milton Johnson: Sure. Generally, probably half of our contracts would be with Blue Cross entities. And with respect to the pricing, our revenue per equivalent admission averages, with commercial, probably around $18,500 to $19,000, and Medicare is usually around $10,000 to $10,500 per equivalent admission.
Victor L. Campbell: And Juan anything to add?
Juan Vallarino: No, I'm good.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess just on the exchange topic. Can you maybe help us talk about what happens in the event that you aren't included in a narrow network product on exchange. Would you just bill at the out-of-network rate for anyone that comes to you, I guess? And then secondly, are there provisions in your existing contracts that would allow you to exit an existing managed care relationship if you weren't included in exchange product or would you have to wait for that contract to end?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Juan, you want to take that?
Juan Vallarino: Ralph, good questions on both. On the out-of-network, we would get out-of-network payments and we would bill it -- bill charges, we were not in the network. And to answer the second question, we'd have to wait. We'll have to issue a notice of, what is it, 180-day -- whatever the contract allows for.
Operator: We'll go next to A.J. Rice with UBS.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I guess I'll ask a more mundane, immediate question and leave the 2014 questions to others. The cost initiative that you put in place, can you expand on that a little bit more in terms of what it might mean? I know you guys had a big cost reduction program back in the second quarter of 2011 after a tough quarter. Is what we're talking about, that you implemented something similar to that, maybe use that as a way to gauge it?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, I think there are similar elements to what we've done this year versus what we did in the past, A.J. I think the thing that we dealt with in the quarter is typically you have seasonal labor related to certain traveler contracts and so forth to deal with expected volume levels, you have to make commitments to those contracts in advance and you tend to have a runoff on those contracts. So we had to work our way out of those contracts first and foremost as quickly as we possibly can to get rid of the premium labor that was there to take care of the volume that did in fact show up as expected. From there, we approach it as we typically do. We make sure our headcount is consistent with where our expectations are related to volumes as we see them over the remaining portion of the year. Again that required some adjustments, both in our variable staffing, as well as some fixed staffing in certain situations where we made some judgments that the volumes had trended down more than we anticipated, and we're going to take a conservative view on that. And we have been able to significantly impact our headcount per patient over the last 45 to 60 days as compared to where we were in January. And it's important to understand we had record census in January at many of our hospitals. And as the flu burned off, we had dramatic drops in census 10%, 12% in inpatient census for some of our facilities. And it's not easy to adjust downward that quickly when we see that kind of migration out of our hospitals because of one particular condition. With respect to our other cost initiatives, they continue to be productive for the company, and we think they will continue to produce some incremental benefit as we move through the year. Those involve supply chain initiatives as you know, there are certain clinical initiatives that we think will enhance our cost structure. And so we anticipate similar transitions between quarter-over-quarter performance as we've seen in the past to line up with the volume expectations for the remaining portion of the year.
Richard M. Bracken: The only thing -- this is Richard. The only thing I would add to that, A.J., is that in addition to the sort of the real-time actions that Sam described, we have made some significant structural changes in our approach to expense management that tries to move our best practices across the enterprise. You might recall we refer to this as our performance improvement program. We started this almost 5 years ago. We have now 60 dedicated employees that are on the road to targeted hospitals throughout the year. We typically get to, not quite 20, around 15 to 20 hospitals. These teams stay at the facility sometimes 3 months. They monitor on a detailed basis any number of variables, labor staffing, best practices, supplies, and even our clinical agenda and improvements in our clinical variation are also included in these reviews. So in addition to the daily work that our management teams do that adjusts variable expenses, we have a system in place that deals -- tries to deal with pulling out more structural costs and has been very successful for us.
Operator: And we'll go next to Andrew Schenker with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So the acquisitions in Kansas City have been in the works for a while here, but can you just kind of remind us of your views on uses of capital going forward? And maybe how the acquisition pipeline is looking?
Richard M. Bracken: Let me just comment on acquisitions -- this is Richard again -- for just a second. Milton might want to add some more on our other uses of capital. But relative to acquisitions, we, of course, remain very interested in pursuing strategic acquisitions. And as we have mentioned many times in the past, following reinvestment in our existing assets, strategic acquisitions are considered a priority use of our capital. We continue to consider these opportunities as they present themselves. And as you know, this is an unpredictable process. They mature in the marketplace at different rates and in different markets and we have to consider them all independently. We prefer acquisitions or even partnership opportunities that are complementary to our existing strategy. Large urban markets, for example. We like acquisitions that can maximize benefit from our existing infrastructure. For example, domestic versus international. And we really are looking towards acquisitions and markets where over time, we believe that we could achieve a meaningful share presence. So having said all of that, and those are sort of our desires, we are aware of most all material opportunities that might present themselves in the marketplace. And as such, we're able really to take a look at most everything. Just to close on sort of growth through development. Our primary strategy, as you know, has been sort of based on the organic capacity within our markets, and in investing in those markets, we are pleased that we're in markets that tend to grow faster and have a lot of population concentration. We now have 4 hospitals under construction in Salt Lake City area, Orlando, Houston and Fort Worth. And typically, and including these kinds of developments, we add somewhere between 400 and 500 beds a year of capacity. So this, in combination with a robust operating strategy that Sam mentioned, has really resulted in positive share gains. But we think about acquisitions, we have tuned up our acquisition development department. We're looking at everything that's out there and we're -- we proceed as we think we can make sense out of them.
Victor L. Campbell: Milton, do you want to talk more on...
R. Milton Johnson: I think that's a good description.
Operator: We'll go next to Josh Raskin with Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: The volumes -- I just wanted to clarify, when you gave the monthlies, those were not adjusted for leap year, right? So that February comp of down 3.6%, would that be closer to flat with leap year?
Victor L. Campbell: None of those were adjusted. Those were as reported. So you sort of have to go through and apply your leap year. Everybody sort of does it a little bit differently, so we'll let you have the actuals that we've given you for those months. But clearly, there were moving parts in all of them.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got you. And then the 5 factors that Sam went through, you mentioned the managed care contracting and no changes, et cetera. But are you seeing any changes in benefit design or deductibles or things like that, that you think may be impacting the consumer as opposed to the actual managed care contract itself?
Victor L. Campbell: Sam, you want to lead?
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, I think there are some indications that there are more co-pay and deductible responsibilities out there with our patients than in the previous year. Is it materially different on a year-to-year basis? We're not seeing that in a material way in our accounts receivable activity. Milton, I think we had some increase in the amount of co-pay and deductible per account. But it wasn't yet so significant that it would suggest that it's the primary reason around deceleration in the market. There are reasons to believe that the outpatient volumes are more under pressure with respect to deductible and co-pay changes than inpatient volume. But it's not so material in our look inside of our receivables that would suggest that, that's a primary reason for any deceleration.
R. Milton Johnson: Yes. And maybe I can just give you a few numbers on what Sam's referencing. So I can just give you some of the collection numbers as well. So in the first quarter of this year versus last year, we actually collected 2.9% more in patient cash collections than we did in the first quarter of 2012. As far as upfront collections, we were up 1.1% over last year. When you look at the upfront collection rate, in other words, the average payment per account, it did go up, but Sam's referencing 7.9%, so the average is about $257 versus $238 a year ago. And -- but generally, our collection efforts are going well. Again, patient cash collection's up almost 3%, upfront collection is still up. So it's really the volume of upfront collections did decline a little bit, about 6%, in accordance with some of the volume changes.
Operator: We'll go next to Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess just 2 quick ones. One, can you remind us of some of the nuances to consider and difference in the characteristics as you shift from traditional Medicare and you see those patients more and more in Managed Medicare? And then just on the exchanges, to the degree you're in networks, are you exclusive with that payer or you can -- can you sign up other payers and be in their networks as well?
Victor L. Campbell: Okay, Juan, do you want to take those?
Juan Vallarino: We're not exclusive to any payer, let's put that one aside. And the shift from Medicare to Medicare Advantage, the payment schemes are usually the same. So it's really -- well medical management the plan may or may not play from that patient. But from our perspective there's very little difference.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: From a volume standpoint, very little difference or do you see some sort of an impact typically?
Samuel N. Hazen: It's hard to judge that with 28% of the total population and in some markets it's even significantly less than that. In other markets a little bit higher especially in South Florida. That -- the overall demand for Medicare business changes. Hard to see it on that small piece of the overall equation. I think it's reasonable to believe that there are some impact on demand when it moves from a traditional book of business to a managed book of business. But it's hard for us to quantify that and see that given the influx of new patients into the Medicare population. So it's very hard to discern that.
R. Milton Johnson: And I think typically the Managed Medicare population is the younger Medicare population, which may just have less demand by nature of their age.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Just a follow-up on Josh's question earlier. And one of your peers commented on this earlier this week with regards to the high deductible plans. I mean, can you talk bigger picture maybe if you've seen any change in sort of the seasonal pattern of earnings over the last couple of years, not just as it relates to this year because of the sort of the adoption rate in the high deductible side?
Victor L. Campbell: Okay. Sam, do you want to address that first?
Samuel N. Hazen: I do think we have seen over the past 3 or 4 years a slight movement into the latter half of the year, especially on outpatient volumes. We have seen our outpatient activity in the fourth quarter, in particular, third quarter, a little bit less, but some. A lot of activity in those areas, more on the commercial side. We tend to see a lot of commercial activity in our outpatient business to begin with. Our outpatient surgery as a whole runs about 50% commercial business. Our emergency rooms run around 30% and our outpatient imaging tends to have a pretty good payer mix as well. So as you look at the trends over the past few years, you do see more of a shift towards the latter half of the year on the commercial book of business in the outpatient segment. So can you attribute all that to deductibles and co-pay? Possibly. It's hard to really know, but we have seen some movement. I don't know that I can sit here and quantify it for you exactly, but I think it's fair to say that there has been a shift.
Operator: We'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: On the heels of a difficult quarter, you all have put together a really terrific set of prepared remarks across everyone who spoke. You answered a lot of questions and addressed a lot of issues and I thank you for that. It makes it a lot easier. So my question is this. We've not talked about your guidance, which you've reiterated. Can you walk through with us how you get from the weakness in the first quarter to guidance being maintained? And specifically, if you wouldn't mind commenting on whether or not you're still including or guiding us to include the same level of DSH cut affecting fourth quarter given your commentary about the proposed rule? And, yes, I get that it's proposed and not final.
Victor L. Campbell: All right, Sheryl. And Milton, I think, is prepared for that comment.
R. Milton Johnson: Sure, I'll be happy to bridge our February 2013 guidance that we gave on the fourth quarter call to how we see it today. Of course, we're not revising our range of EBITDA guidance for the year. But we may get there on a slightly different pathway. For example, we gave guidance that our adjusted admission growth in 2013 would be 2% to 3%. I would say now we're -- our belief is that we will most likely come in at the low end of that range. With respect to our revenue rate, we gave guidance that we thought that we would have growth in 2013 between 1% to 2%. I would say now we think that, that number would be more in the 2% to 3% zone. So our -- when you look at our revenue growth overall, I think we're still looking at the same level of revenue growth, just a little less volume, but a little more rate. And then with respect to expenses, we had, I think, given guidance that we thought we would come in, all in, around 2.5% growth. And I would say now based on the first quarter performance, adjusting for HITECH, we reported 4.8%. I think now we're looking more at -- even after the cuts and action plans that we put in place, somewhere probably around 3% to 3.5% would be an expectation. We gave guidance at our overall Medicare rate for 2013, including sequestration, including what we thought the DSH cuts would be, including what we thought the productivity and coding adjustments would be. We said we thought it would be down in 2013, 1.2%. We now believe that would be closer to being down 0.6%, all in. And so with all of those -- there's some movements with the details, that still puts us within our EBITDA range for the year.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And so I guess when we think about the cost initiatives and just trying to think about how -- it was helpful, that last comment about bridging the gap, but is there a thought that you kind of think Q2 here on that run rate or should we expect an acceleration of the cost saves as the year goes on?
Victor L. Campbell: Sam or Milton?
Samuel N. Hazen: Most of our actions were accomplished by the end of March. We had some residual actions that would affect us in the second quarter because of certain timing of events and so forth. So the majority of our efforts to adjust our costs to line up with what we felt our volumes were going to do for the rest of the year were accomplished by the end of March. And so you should see a full benefit of that as we move through the second quarter, assuming we get the volume we're anticipating. Obviously our per-unit metrics are very dependent upon volume because of the fixed cost nature of our business. Therefore, if it were little better we should see better cost per unit obviously and obviously a little worse if we don't get the volume. So the actions that we've taken were 80% implemented by the end of the quarter, and there's maybe 20% or 25% that wasn't implemented that most likely will be implemented sometime in April and we'll get the benefit of that going forward.
Operator: We'll go next to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just was hoping you might be able to update us on your process to evaluate the ACA impact. I know you've said that, that'll come later in the year. I guess just given all the uncertainties that still remain uncertainties, I'm curious about how that process is coming along. And if you've got any updates for us in terms of timing and format of that?
Victor L. Campbell: Milton, you?
R. Milton Johnson: Sure. Ralph -- Darren -- I'm sorry, Darren. We're not going to set a date for that information just yet. You referenced still a lot of uncertainties. Quite frankly, earlier in this year, late last year we thought there might be more certainty. Take, for example, expansion of Medicaid. Still, I think, a lot of uncertainty around that. And so -- and as we're making progress on our exchange contracting that's been helpful. But we're going to remain, I guess, uncommitted with respect to a date. But as we continue to get more clarity, we do expect either later this year, certainly no later than probably the time that we would issue 2014 guidance that we would be giving a multi-year view. But I'm not going to set an expectation for a certain date today.
Richard M. Bracken: And I'll just add, as we go, we're trying to -- each quarter we're trying to update with the relevant information as we did this morning, so as it unfolds for us over each quarter, we'll try to update you on key points.
Operator: We'll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Market.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I'll follow up on the question related to Medicaid expansion in Texas. Let's just say for now Texas doesn't opt in. I'm wondering if you've had a chance to really look at the opportunity in Texas in the subsidy -- subsidized part of the market. My understanding is that 139% up to about 250% of the federal poverty level would actually qualify for essentially full subsidized coverage. So, I wonder what -- have you looked at that for you in Texas, like if we don't get Medicaid expansion, does that -- is that a big opportunity -- what segment of the market would that be for you and then how would you go about the process of outreach to sign that market up?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. I think, Milton, you win that one again.
R. Milton Johnson: Yes, if we don't see Medicaid expansion, and this is true for Texas, but also other states. We do expect you'll see more uptake from that population, especially at the lower wage rates and poverty level and they would come into the exchange a certain amount. So that, I think, would be a positive for us to help offset having fewer lives covered in a market. So I do agree with that and that's how we're thinking about it from a modeling standpoint, if, in fact, you don't see expansion.
Richard M. Bracken: And I would -- on that last piece of your question, where you said you know what, about enrollment in the marketplace. Let me just give you more general comment about how we're thinking about that. Of course, enrolling in these plans is important. And we've thought a lot about how we should proceed in this. We -- to that end, we engaged an outside group that's been working with us. Doing a lot of focus groups in key markets, understanding what activities might be in the given markets. We don't want to duplicate anything, make sure that any efforts that we would take would be complementary in nature. We're infusing that logic with all the quantitative research that we've done about the uninsured. And so we have a pretty robust set of analysis going on to figure out how we should participate in this effort. But we haven't obviously put anything out yet and we're continuing to fine-tune that effort. So more on that as we work through our processes.
Operator: We'll go next to Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just not to beat the volume topic to death, but let me just try one more. Have you looked at the pattern of prior serious flu seasons and, I guess, looking back -- I guess you had to go back 10 years ago, maybe, to that 2003, '04 season. Did volumes drop off as the flu abated there? Just wondering if there's some precedent on that front?
Victor L. Campbell: Sam, we're going to test your memory here.
Samuel N. Hazen: I can't give you any specifics on the flu from 10 years ago. I'll tell you this. For the quarter, our inpatient activity was positive by 0.5 point related to the flu. Our emergency room activity was down 0.5 point because of flu activity on a year-over-year basis. It's important to understand for HCA -- I was telling the team this before the call, our admission activity, our average daily census and our ER volumes in the first quarter of 2013 was the highest volume the company has had in 17 consecutive quarters. And probably if I had data in front of me beyond that, it would be even more -- it's probably the highest we've had since the Columbia/HCA days when there was over 300 hospitals in the portfolio. So our overall volume was at a peak. Now it wasn't on outpatient activity that are dependent on calendar days and/or surgical activities, which depend on calendar days, but our overall volume was very strong in aggregate. And so how the flu reacts, I mean, December in the fourth quarter for HCA of 2012 was a record year-over-year kind of growth on both inpatient activities and adjusted admission activity. A lot of which was driven by the flu we were seeing early in December in a lot of our states. So there was that kind of dynamic going on, too, where it straddled both 2012 and 2013. So it's really hard for me to give you any sense of it, but the flu does affect our business and it comes and goes, and it can be very short, it can be protracted. It's hard to say exactly how it's going to change from one period to the other.
Victor L. Campbell: Thank you. I'm debating with myself right here. We've had 12 questions. Do we do number 13 or not? I'm going to take a chance. We're going to take one last question. Just don't throw me a curveball.
Operator: We'll go last to Gary Lieberman, with Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess 13 is my lucky number today. I hope this isn't too much of a curveball. Maybe going back to the Medicaid expansion. Would be interested in your observations and maybe your thoughts on how you see the politics or the process playing out in Florida and Texas and how they decide on what they're going to do.
Victor L. Campbell: So you did throw the curveball, it came to me. We're all reading the same press. We obviously have folks in both places. I think, clearly, if you look at Florida and Texas, it's probably greater odds for something to happen in Florida, but it's getting down to the wire and they've got, I guess, until the end of the week for this session to end. And so again, it's a moving part and I don't want to place any bets one way or the other there. Clearly, we're supportive, we would like to see it go in that direction. But we'll just see that play out. There's always the opportunity for a special session. Whether or not that would happen or not, again, is anyone's best guess. Texas is probably a little -- maybe a little more political at this point. There are folks down there that would like to see it move forward. You also have a situation where that session, they meet every other year, so if they don't get something done here pretty quick, we're not going to likely see a special session until the year after next. So I'd say, coin tosses, maybe a 2-headed coin in 1 state. And with that, I want to thank everybody for your participation. I know Mark is excited to take all your calls this afternoon, and I will be here as well. Thank you for participating.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: [Audio Gap] Earning Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell: Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I, would like to welcome you on today's call, including those of you listening to our webcast. With me here this morning as usual is our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operations. Several other members of the HCA senior management team are here with us as well to assist during the Q&A. Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they're based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statement, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, let me turn the call over to Richard Bracken.
Richard M. Bracken: Thanks, Vic. Good morning to all and thanks for joining us on our call this morning. I'd like to start today by providing a few general thoughts on our fourth quarter performance as well as some observations for the entire year. And then following this, I have a few comments that I'd like to make about our ongoing work to analyze the potential effects of the health care reform legislation. So for the fourth quarter. Generally, we were pleased with our overall performance for the quarter. For the most part and from an operations perspective, the trends we have been reporting in prior quarters in the year continued to play out in the fourth quarter. Favorable growth in patient volumes driven by market growth, as well as continued improvement in market share performance and favorable expense management helped to offset continued pressures in growth of per unit revenues. Our favorable volume performance has allowed us to operate more efficiently by spreading our fixed costs over a larger base and accordingly, helped overcome some of the revenue pressures. As is our standard practice, in just a moment, Milton and Sam will provide detail in all of this, but my general takeaway for the quarter and really for the year is that our positions in our key markets remain strong. Our markets are growing, our operating agendas are structured appropriately, they are focused and they are effective. And the public and the communities we serve increasingly choose our delivery networks for their health care needs. We are working hard to earn their choice by providing convenient access to our facilities, a comprehensive scope of services and technologies, a high level of service and quality clinical care. Regardless of how the health care delivery in America evolves, we believe these are key ingredients for success. Same facility equivalent admissions grew 5% in the fourth quarter, making 21 straight quarters or over 5 years straight of volume gains. This year's early and difficult flu season did impact our fourth quarter inpatient and emergency room volumes. However, growth in both these indicators were strong even when normalized for flu-associated volumes. Same facility emergency room visits in the fourth quarter were robust, increasing 12.7% over the prior year and increased 8.6% for the entire year. Throughout all of 2012, revenues increased to $33 billion, an 11.2% growth over the prior year; and adjusted EBITDA rose to $6.531 billion, a 7.8% increase over prior year. EBITDA, as previously reported, reflects the consolidation of our HealthONE venture for the full year, HITECH income and net Medicare settlements in the first quarter of 2012. Cash flow from operations in 2012 remains strong, totaling $4.175 billion compared to $3.933 billion last year. And as we have previously stated, our rank priority for use of cash is, first, to invest in our existing markets in 2012. We invested $1.862 billion in CapEx, comprising approximately $1.62 billion on facilities and equipment, which accommodated the development of 400 new beds and $238 million on information technology. Secondly, focus on strategic acquisitions that can provide long-term growth for the company. And following these first 2 priorities, we consider a wide range of strategic options that can improve value to our shareholders, including debt repayment, share repurchase or the distribution of special dividends, which as you know, we did on 3 occasions during 2012. As you will recall, in October of 2011, we purchased our partner's remaining ownership position in our HealthONE venture. Given the size of this transaction, we thought it might be helpful to share some perspective on the performance following this transaction. Our Denver market continued to perform favorably even exceeding our internal expectations. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.2%, revenues increased 7.5% and equivalent admissions grew 5.7% over 2011 results. Now before concluding my prepared comments this morning, I want to provide some general observations we have formulated concerning our analysis of the impacts of health care reform. Our most fundamental observation is while certain areas within the health care reform agenda are settled, many, and I stress, many uncertainties remain. These uncertainties make accurate modeling at this time very challenging. Nevertheless, we, like many of you, are in the process of trying to more fully understand the impact of this legislation and size the longer-term effects that it might have. Over the past months, Milton has been leading an effort within our organization, along with multiple outside resources, to develop working assumptions that begin to quantify the range of potential impacts of the Affordable Care Act on our company. Let me emphasize that this is preliminary work and is expected to change as details that shape these assumptions continue to mature. Having said all of this, we continue to develop and access our data and intelligence that is helping us to improve our analysis. Our goal is to reach a point, perhaps in the mid to latter part of this year, when we feel comfortable sharing some of our assessments of key assumptions and begin to size the potential impacts of reform. One belief that we do have is that reform is not all about 2014. We see it as being incremental, varied by market and evolving over a period of years. Consider the following. It's possible that the ramp-up of newly insured enrollees and the exchanges may take 3 to 4 years to reach a steady-state level. These states in our portfolio have not determined yet whether they will expand Medicaid coverage or when they might do so. The degree of employer opt out into the exchanges, which we believe in part will be influenced by employer size, still is to be determined. And reimbursement rates to providers for exchange products, the utilization patterns of the newly insured and the effects of local market dynamics, to name just a few open issues, still need time to prove out. As time progresses, we should continue to get more clarity around many of these areas, allowing us to refine our model and expectations. I should probably add that while we all know the amount of the annual market basket reductions that were included in the Affordable Care Act to fund coverage expansion, the computation of the Medicare disproportionate share, or DSH, reallocation which is scheduled to begin this October 1, is more difficult to quantify at this time. Milton will discuss our current thinking on DSH allocation in just a minute. So as we reflect upon all of this, we believe we are well positioned to perform in the reform environment. And let me close by sharing with you that HCA's performance on the CMS core measures of clinical quality is now at 99.1% as compared with the national average of 97.4% based on their most recent release. We extend our appreciation to our management and clinical teams at these facilities for this performance. And with that, I'll turn the call to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson: Thank you, Richard, and good morning. I hope most of you had a chance now to review our fourth quarter earnings release issued this morning. Sam and I will provide some thoughts around the fourth quarter results, and then I'll close by addressing our 2013 guidance. Revenues in the fourth quarter increased 8.5% to $8.434 billion, primarily reflecting consolidation of our HealthONE venture and increased patient volumes. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.606 billion, a decline of 2% from the prior year's $1.639 billion. HITECH incentive income declined in the fourth quarter of this year by $40 million to $80 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Volume trends in the quarter were strong, with same facility admissions increasing 4.3% and same facility equivalent admissions increasing 5%, compared to strong volume comps from last year's fourth quarter of 2.5% and 3.2%, respectively. Our same facility medical admissions increased 6.1%, while same facility surgical admissions increased 0.7% compared to the prior year. Total admissions increased 6%, while equivalent admissions increased 7.1% compared to the prior year. Same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 5.1% and 5.7%, respectively, in the fourth quarter. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and Managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 17.5% on a same-facility basis and represent 27% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 6.1%, while same facility equivalent admissions increased 8.3% in the quarter. Same facility managed care and other admissions increased 1% in the fourth quarter, our highest quarterly growth rate in 2012. Same facility managed care and other equivalent admissions increased 2% over the prior year's fourth quarter. Uninsured admissions increased 11% on a same-facility basis in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. The growth in uninsured admits accounted for approximately 80 basis points of the 4.3% same facility admission growth during the fourth quarter. Same facility uninsured admissions represents 7.6% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 7.2% in last year's fourth quarter. Same facility emergency room visits were strong, increasing 12.7% in the quarter. On a consolidated basis, ER visits increased 14.1% during the quarter compared to the prior year. Total same facility surgeries increased 1.4% in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 0.9% in our same facility inpatient surgeries and 1.8% in our same facility outpatient surgeries. During the quarter, we view our revenue growth rate at stable to slightly improving compared to recent trends. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 0.5% in the fourth quarter, consistent with what we've recorded in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of the Texas Medicaid waiver program, revenue per equivalent admission increased 1.8%. During the fourth quarter, same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission increased 0.7%. Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission, excluding the Texas Medicaid waiver program, increased 0.9%. Managed Medicare and other increased 4.8% over the prior-year period, the highest quarterly growth rate yield on our managed care revenue in 2012. Same facility security care and uninsured discounts increased $184 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. During the fourth quarter, same facility charity care discounts totaled $716 million, an increase of $31 million in the prior-year period, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $1.691 billion, an increase of $153 million from the prior-year period. We were pleased with our overall expense management in the quarter. Same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 1.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility operating expense, excluding HITECH and Texas Medicaid waiver program expenses, increased 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012, which is fairly consistent with third quarter expense trends. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 2.2% on a same-facility basis. Same facility productivity performance is measured by man hours per equivalent admission, improved 1.5% over the prior-year period, and same facility wage rate growth was 2.3% in the fourth quarter. Personnel costs associated with physician employment increased by $5 million or 2.2% from the previous year's fourth quarter. Same facility supply costs per equivalent admission increased 3.6% from the prior-year period, reflecting increased surgical volumes and a reclassification at HealthTrust Purchasing Group that was implemented effective October 1, 2012, a reclassification related to nonequity member administrative fees previously accounted for as a reduction in supply expense being reclassified as HealthTrust Purchasing Group revenues. The amount reclassified was approximately $41 million and contributes 310 basis points to the growth of supply expense per equivalent admission in the fourth quarter. The reclassification had no impact on adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Same facility other operating expense -- other operating cost per equivalent admission declined 3.7% from the prior-year period, primarily due to a $69 million decline in Texas Medicaid waiver program-related expenses. We recognized $80 million in electronic health record incentive income in the fourth quarter compared to $120 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This is consistent with our expectations. The company also incurred approximately $19 million in EHR-related expense in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011. Substantially all of our hospitals have achieved the second year Stage 1 Meaningful Use and have certified as such during the fourth quarter. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $1.263 billion in the quarter compared to $1.387 billion last year. The decline was primarily due to increased tax payments. Cash tax payments totaled $190 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to a net cash tax refund of $161 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Days and accounts receivable at the end of the fourth quarter were 51 days compared to 52 days for the same period last year. And at December 31, 2012, the company's debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 4.4x compared to 4.5x at December 31, 2011. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.964 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities. With that, now let me turn the call over to Sam.
Samuel N. Hazen: Good morning. I'll begin my comments this morning with more detail on the company's volume trends for the quarter and then provide an update on inpatient market share for the second quarter of 2012. Volume growth across the company's 14 domestic divisions was very consistent again this quarter. On a year-over-year basis, 13 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth in same facility inpatient admissions, 9 divisions had growth in same facility managed care inpatient admissions. Same facility inpatient admissions, excluding pulmonary or flu-related admissions, were up 3.3%, which represents a strong rate of normalized growth for the quarter. All 14 domestic divisions had growth in same facility adjusted admissions. 12 divisions had growth in same facility managed care adjusted admissions. The company has implemented specific plans to grow the commercial segment of our business, and we believe our plans are progressing well across most markets. All divisions had growth in same facility emergency room visits again this quarter, reflecting continued success with our many initiatives to gain share in this service line. Additionally, all divisions had growth in managed care emergency room visits, which were up 9.6%. And finally, EMS visits to our emergency rooms grew by 5.9%. All divisions had growth in this area also. Same facility ER visits, excluding pulmonary or flu-related visits, were up 8.9% for the quarter. This adjusted rate is above our 2012 growth rate for prior quarters and like inpatient admissions, represents a strong rate of normalized growth. Milton mentioned the improvement in our surgical volumes this quarter. On an inpatient basis, orthopedics, neurosurgery and oncology services showed the strongest growth. On an outpatient basis, orthopedics, women's and GI services were strong. Managed care outpatient surgery volumes this quarter were essentially flat, which is an improvement over recent trends. Same facility admissions into our adult intensive care and neonatal intensive care units this quarter were up 3.5% and 1.8%, respectively. The growth in our neonatal volume is driven mostly by growth in obstetrics admissions, which grew 4.0% this quarter. Growth in managed care obstetrics admissions was comparable. And finally, on a same-facility basis, behavioral admissions grew 6.7% in the quarter, and rehab admissions grew 15.9%. Now let me transition to some market share highlights for the 12 months ending second quarter 2012. Again, this is the most current data available, and it represents almost 90% of the company's market. First, the company's overall market share during this period increased by 54 basis points to 23.3%. Second, we gained market share on a sequential basis when comparing the second quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2012. This follows sequential market share gains in each of the past 3 quarters as compared to the respective preceding quarter. Market share for the second quarter was the highest it has been over the past 14 quarters. We gained market share in 13 out of 17 service lines that we monitor. HCA had market share gains in 28 of 37 markets, with strong growth in all major Texas markets, Denver, Miami, Jacksonville, Nashville, Richmond and Las Vegas. We had market share growth in both the commercial and in-migration segments of our business. And finally, overall market demand at HCA's markets for inpatient admissions in this period grew by 0.5%, which is a slight acceleration from the same period 12 months ago. If we use this growth rate as a proxy for inpatient demand in the third and fourth quarters of 2012, we believe HCA will show, when the data becomes available, further gains in market share during these periods also. As we move into 2013, we believe the components of our organic growth plans, coupled with the continual leveraging of best practices across the company, position us well to drive comparable gains in market share. With that, I'll turn the call back to Milton.
R. Milton Johnson: Thanks, Sam. Before discussing our guidance for 2013, I'd like to comment on our results for 2012 relative to the guidance we gave you last year. Recall that we last revised our 2012 guidance on May 3, 2012. We hit the high end of our revenue estimate of $33 billion and finished slightly above the midpoint of our range for adjusted EBITDA guidance. Although we were able to meet our guidance for adjusted EBITDA for the year, the underlying metrics were challenging. Our same facility revenue rate growth fell short of the 1.5% to 2% target with 0.3% growth. We were able to offset the revenue rate shortfall with volumes well above our expectations and better expense management than planned. Now turning to our 2013 guidance. As noted in our earnings release this morning, we estimate for 2013 consolidated revenues should range from $33.5 billion to $34.5 billion. This does not include the impact from acquisitions that may be completed in 2013. Adjusted EBITDA, we estimate a range of $6.25 -- $6.25 billion to $6.5 billion for the year, while earnings per diluted share are estimated to range from $3 to $3.30 for 2013. We estimate equivalent admission growth to range from 2% to 3% for the year. With respect to net revenues per equivalent admissions, excluding the impact of the Texas Medicaid waiver program, we expect growth of 1% to 2% in 2013. We expect to continue to face reimbursement pressure from governmental payers during 2013. Medicare revenues in our 2013 estimate reflect a composite declining rate of approximately 1.2%, and our estimate assumes the following: 2% payment reduction attributable to sequestration beginning in April; coding recruitment reductions, which were included in the year-end [indiscernible] legislation of approximately $25 million, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013. Although the rules related to DSH redistribution will not be issued until April, our estimate assumes Medicare DSH reductions of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 resulting from the Affordable Care Act planned for DSH redistribution. We remain hopeful that the final redistribution rule will result in a redistribution that more reasonably reflects the number of uninsured patients we treat at our facility. Medicaid revenues reflect an estimated reduction of approximately $40 million related to the Texas Medicaid waiver program. Additionally, we expect rate reductions in Managed Medicaid in 2013. Relative to operating expenses, we anticipate that we continue to benefit from a low inflationary environment in 2013 while continuing to invest in our clinical and EHR development initiatives. Our expense per equivalent admission, excluding the Texas Medicaid waiver program expense, is estimated to increase by approximately 2.5% over the prior year. Following our IPO in 2011, we adopted a new management equity program with annual grants generally vesting in an expense over a 4-year period. As a result, it will take a full 4 years for this noncash, share-based compensation expense to fully normalize in our adjusted EBITDA run rate. In 2012, the company recognized $56 million related to the program. Our 2013 guidance includes the second year of the program, with noncash, share-based compensation expense increasing to $128 million or a $72 million increase over 2012. The 2013 guidance includes estimated HITECH incentive income of $200 million to $225 million and HITECH-related expenses in the range of $110 million to $130 million. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, our adjusted EBITDA growth for 2013 will be negatively impacted as compared to 2012 by the net favorable Medicare adjustment, both the rural floor and SSI ratio recorded in the first quarter of 2012 of $170 million, and approximately $115 million less HITECH incentive income in 2013. These 2 items have a 460-basis-point negative impact on 2013 adjusted EBITDA growth. When also considering the noncash, share-based compensation expense growth, the negative impact on 2013 adjusted EBITDA totals 580 basis points. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Vic.
Victor L. Campbell: All right. Milton, Richard, Sam, thank you. Candice, if you want to come back on and poll for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to A.J. Rice from UBS.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Maybe I'll go back to Richard's comment on the health reform. I think you highlighted 4 major variables: ramp-up in coverage, Medicaid expansion, rates on exchanges and employer dumping. Can you -- I know you guys aren't going to be ready to give specifics for a while, but I wondered if you could tell us, as you think about the variability around each of those, which one has the most -- which ones have the most swing factor to you? And if there's any sense on your part, when you might get visibility on those 4 items?
Richard M. Bracken: Okay. A.J., thank you. And as I look at those variables, they all look important to me. I would say that, though, if I had to pick something that I think is most important, it would clearly be reimbursement rates that we would negotiate exchange products at and really the sort of the utilization rates of the uninsured. And both of these things are going to -- that's why we are struggling to be definitive at this point in time. And what -- the way we look at the work we're doing now is there's a lot of variables out there. And some we're able to begin to size through work that's being done by focus groups and surveys and relative to the employer intentions or potential actions that publics might take in certain markets, and we begin to size pieces of it. But others that are going to be rate-based or utilization-based will take more time to actually come online. We certainly know what our commercial books are at. We've been pretty public about how we think about that. We're looking at each of these markets being independent. We don't have a strategy or a policy that's going to roll out over every market. So this is truly a model that's in development and that we're continuing to get pieces and facts around. And we'll let you know what we have, as we've said, in the middle to latter part of the year. And it'll be what it is at that point in time. There'll still be holes at that point in time. But as much as we've been able to figure out or put some detail around or to the degree in which what we are assuming things, we'll put that out as well.
Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, just maybe a follow-up on that, a comment around managed care. Can you just sort of update us again where you're at in contracting for 2013 and 2014? And does any of that have exchange-related contracting in it at this point?
R. Milton Johnson: A.J., this is Milton. Right now -- the answer to the second part of the question is no. We -- right now our contracts are structured basically consistent with where they've been over recent years. We've got virtually all of 2013 managed care revenue under contract and that's a contracted rate of 5% to 6%. We've got about half of the managed care revenues for 2014 under contract and similar rate increases and probably 35-or-so percent of '15. So again, as usual, a lot of visibility into our managed care contracting. But really at this point in time, no material exchange products have been negotiated.
Operator: And we'll go next to Chris Rigg from Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I guess I just wanted to follow up on the DSH money. So you're basically saying it's $200 million annually, is that correct?
R. Milton Johnson: That's our estimate as of today. And hopefully, when the regs are issued in April, we can have a more favorable outcome. But based on what we know today, what we expect today, it would be an annual negative impact of about $200 million.
Victor L. Campbell: And Chris, this is Vic. We'll see proposed regs come out in April, and the industry will have a period of time to comment and then the final rule usually comes out in August.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And is the money -- what were the Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments in 2012?
R. Milton Johnson: Probably, I'd say, Medicaid and Medicare probably around $650 million or so, $650 million.
Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess a follow-up on the sort of managed care pricing. And when you think about the way HCA has set up cluster market strategies, local market strength, and you hear the managed care guys talking about they think narrow networks is sort of what you're going to see in 2014, do you view your sort of cluster strategy as being advantageous? Meaning, you're going to be a part of the narrow network, or that allows you to sort of hold the line on pricing and stay kind of status quo is what it is?
R. Milton Johnson: Well, first of all, in health care reform and what Richard was obviously commenting about, it's going to be a very market-by-market driven strategy. There's not going to be a overall HCA cookie-cutter approach. It will be market-by-market. And certainly, there are markets where we may find a restricted network or narrow network attractive. But again, it's going to be based upon market circumstances and taking into account the number of uninsured lives and the market share and the like.
Operator: And we'll go next to Matt Borsch from Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: If I could ask a follow-up question on the managed care contracting for the exchanges. If you don't have those rates locked down, do you default to the commercial rates? I just wanted to confirm that. And can you characterize the early pace of the negotiations in terms of what you think the expectations of the health plans are in those negotiations?
Victor L. Campbell: Matt, thank you. We have Juan Vallarino, who heads up our Managed Care Group. You want to address that one?
Juan Vallarino: Sure. Matt, the answer to the first question is our current contracts do not include exchange pricing, so it's a separate bucket. So commercial rates do not apply nor Medicaid rates do not apply. The second, discussions are really too early to go into any substantive rate discussion. Everything we're hearing right now is posturing on both sides. And I think over the next 45 days, you'll see it come to fruition and a lot of good plays out in network sizing, volume assumptions and the like.
Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: All right. And just if I could as a follow-up on a different topic. How do you interpret the stronger utilization trend that you're seeing? I mean, we've been waiting for utilization demand to firm up somewhat. Historically, there's a -- at least we've looked at and I know some of the actuaries have to pattern a multi-year lag for utilization demand to return after the beginning of an economic recovery. How are you looking at it at this stage?
Victor L. Campbell: All right. I'm going to ask Sam Hazen to address that. And also, I want to encourage folks, hold your questions to one because we got a bunch of people on the line. I'm going to hate to cut people off when we get there. All right. Go ahead, Sam.
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, I think as I've said on my comments, we have seen a slight acceleration in overall demand across HCA's markets. Again, I think that speaks to our portfolio, as we've said before, in that where we're located, which markets we serve, we have in general a better economic circumstance than other markets. So I think that's driving some piece of the demand that we're seeing inside of HCA. The second thing is the strategy of the company is yielding, I think, some results obviously as our market share continues to show improvement. But what we are seeing on the commercial side, it's somewhat encouraging. We've seen sequentially across the quarters a slowdown in overall commercial reductions to the point where the last few quarters have started to get closer to sort of a flat environment inside of HCA's market. And so that's, I think, a function of the lag that you mentioned previously about the economic rebound and how it affects overall demand on the commercial book of business. Obviously, on the Medicare side -- in the Medicaid side, utilization is not controlled to the same degree. It doesn't get the same kind of impact in our estimation as the commercial side does with respect to the economy, but we are seeing that. So as we build our 2013 assumptions, we did factor in those observations and built that into our top line assumptions.
Operator: And we'll go next to Joshua Raskin from Barclays.
Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess my one question just focused on Las Vegas market. I think you guys gave the update that, that was one of the markets that showed the improvement in market share. So I'm just curious, what do you think is driving that? And do you guys have any updated thoughts on potential contract negotiation with the biggest payer there?
Victor L. Campbell: Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, when we severed our relationship with Sierra, now United, many years ago, we had to reinvent ourselves in that market in order to be effective. And part of that strategy, I think, has served us well with our ability to operate our emergency rooms, our ability to focus on our physician relationships and creating opportunities for them to do business at HCA's facilities. And then we've been very effective in our outreach efforts in that market to compensate for the fact that we're dealing with a very small market when you consider our out-of-network position with Sierra. We've added service lines that have helped us there as well. And so from that standpoint, we've been very pleased with the overall trend lines as it relates to our admission activity and market share performance. We're obviously open to discussions. We have ongoing discussions with the folks in Las Vegas in United. We haven't yet reached any kind of relationship, but we're open to that as the opportunity presents itself, but it has to be at a rate that obviously makes sense for us. We continue to invest in this market. We are adding capacity at a couple of our facilities to accommodate the growth as well as some program development. And we're seeing a little bit of a turn in the economy, which is having a slight impact on our payer mix, not material, but better than it's been over the past few years. So we continue to plug along with the same basic elements of our strategy, and we're reasonably optimistic. It's important to understand Las Vegas only represents about 3% to 4% of the company's volume. It's a very small piece of our overall portfolio. But it is an important market to us, and we continue to focus our efforts appropriately.
Operator: And we'll go next to Justin Lake from JPMorgan.
Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: My question is a follow-up on reform. I wanted to make sure I'm hearing you correctly. So you're expecting reform to be a multi-year impact, which makes sense. You don't get the full benefit in 2014 of coverage expansion and obviously, there's a lot of moving parts. But given the moving parts for 2014, do you still believe the net impact of reform is likely to be positive overall in the company? Or could the variables you laid out actually lead to a net headwind from reform in 2014?
R. Milton Johnson: Justin, yes, we're not going to give guidance on 2014 health care reform today. As Richard mentioned, we're still working through our views in the model and hopefully later this year, we will be able to give you that information, probably not only for one year but for a multiyear outlook for health care reform.
Operator: And we'll go next to Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets.
Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: I guess my question is sort of on the acquisition environment. You mentioned strategic acquisition as sort of a second priority for cash. Can you tell us a little bit more about your thoughts there? Is it sort of supplementing within markets? Would you buy big systems in brand new markets? And behavioral and rehab have been really strong contributors on volumes. So are you thinking about ancillary areas like that as well in your acquisition strategy?
Victor L. Campbell: Richard, do you want that one?
Richard M. Bracken: I'll start off on the general acquisition sort of strategy. Of course, we do believe that the environment is certainly more -- there are more opportunities presenting themselves now than there were a couple of years ago, and we're certainly processing more potential opportunities for acquisition. Having said that, acquisitions come up when they come up. They can be choppy. It's a reaction from the marketplace. And we think the marketplace, as it gets more difficult over the future years, there will continue to be more acquisitions, and we will remain very interested in analyzing those. Our filters that we put through acquisitions through are many. I think you know historically, we have been very disciplined buyers. We think that's important going forward. We obviously like acquisitions of not only hospitals but all associated parts of our network strategies that support our markets. So we're open to different kinds of things in our key markets. Clearly, our strategy is to focus on where we have a base of operations rather than de novo market. And relative to de novo markets, we do consider them if we can establish what we feel would be a meaningful network strategy over a period of time and be a meaningful market share player. So I would say the de novo markets are probably lower down on our priority list, but the existing markets and all parts of the network strategy would be in our cross hairs.
Victor L. Campbell: Sam, you want to...
Samuel N. Hazen: Yes, let me just add to Richard's comments. Last year 2012, the company acquired 6 outpatient surgery centers inside of existing markets and obviously, the intent there is to complement our network of access and to develop our new physician relationships. In addition to that, we acquired a surgical hospital in another one of our markets, which expanded our capacity and expanded our reach in that community. And then finally, on the, I'll call it, the sub-accute, we have a letter of intent to acquire a rehab hospital in the market. So we're very focused on adding appropriately to our network through those add-on acquisitions. And that will continue to be our strategy in 2013 as those opportunities surface. In those markets where we think we have substantial market share and the inability to acquire or there's just not anything available in our opinion, we have a move towards adding capacity and adding new facilities. As I mentioned on the last call, we have 4 new hospitals that are under construction in major HCA markets that will -- 2 of them will come online this year in 2013 and 2 of them will come online in early 2014. We think these are long-term plays for the company but at the same time, they're very complementary to existing networks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ralph Giacobbe from Crédit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just in terms of the reform assumptions, going back, just to clarify, later this year, should we expect kind of guidance in terms of EBITDA and EPS or just a kind of framework, I guess, first? And then just along those lines, can you talk about what you're doing now or plan to do in 2013 to prepare for 2014 in terms of kind of both operational as well as an outreach perspective? Like how much of a role can you all play in getting people signed up for exchanges and/or processes in place to get them signed up for Medicaid?
Victor L. Campbell: Milton, you want that?
R. Milton Johnson: Yes, so Ralph, what we're anticipating and again, I'm going to keep some flexibility here as we continue to work through this project. But what we anticipate is getting the impact on the company from health care reform, both we see the upside and then how we see the cuts that we -- from on the Medicare program. So it would be kind of a with and without approach is what we're anticipating. It would not -- our outlook would not include anything about the base business in those out years. It would include the impact of health care reform on the base business with whatever market forces we're dealing with in those out years. And it would be presented most likely in a range of EBITDA impact is how we're thinking about it. Relative to what we're doing, I think what -- how we operate the business every day and how we've been operating our business for years will actually position us well in a health care reform environment. So I don't see major changes in how we run the company in a health care reform environment. Obviously, as I said earlier, market-by-market there will be new opportunities, and we will certainly implement strategies to maximize opportunities in those markets.
Operator: And we'll go next to Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to confirm, the numbers you gave on rehab and behavioral, were those same-store or were those total?
Victor L. Campbell: Those were same-store numbers.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Got it. 2 questions, just hoping to get a quick update on the observation stay versus 1-day stay. Has that stabilized? Is it incrementally getting better or worse? And then finally, do we expect any ER volumes spill over into the first quarter that kind of strengthens going to fourth?
R. Milton Johnson: Yes, the observation 1-day stay, that has stabilized, and that has not been an issue for us this year. So it remains stable, and the outlook for that is to remain stable.
Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then ER volumes?
R. Milton Johnson: Sam, I didn't hear what the question.
Samuel N. Hazen: He was thinking about ER volume into '13, early part of '13.
Victor L. Campbell: Yes, and I guess, Frank, I think we really don't comment on current quarter periods of time. So obviously, and by reading the press, there's lots of flu out there. But I think in terms of trying to discuss January or February, we don't want to do that on this call.
Operator: And we'll go next to Sheryl Skolnick from CRT Capital Group.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Since I think I've heard you say we're not going to talk about anything more on reform, I think I'm not going to ask you about reform. So let me ask you a different -- a completely different question then. One of the concerns that I have heard from investors in your stock today is the disconnect between the EBITDA and where consensus is generally in line with your guidance. And so we get the joke that you got 500 basis points plus of pressure but you're still producing EBITDA that's almost in line with what you reported this year. But the EPS seems to be out of whack. So can you help us to understand where we are wrong as a consensus estimate on the Street between the EBITDA and the net income per share line?
R. Milton Johnson: Sheryl, this is Milton. Let me try to walk you through that. So if you think about the range of EBITDA guidance, the $6.25 billion to $6.5 billion for 2013, if you walk down in our assumptions around depreciation, approximately $1.7 billion in depreciation expense, we would expect interest expense to be in the range of about $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion for the year. Tax rate, call it like 38.5%, 39% tax rate and about 467 million roughly shares. So I think if you walk down the EBITDA guidance range with those metrics, you will come up with the EPS range.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. Just a clarification here, when you talk about the tax rate, you're talking about the actual tax rate you apply to pretax less noncontrolling interest?
R. Milton Johnson: Yes, you got -- yes, that's correct.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Okay. So that -- it ends up looking lower than 38% when you do it that way?
R. Milton Johnson: Yes, so you have to take net income before taxes, subtract the minor...
Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: Minority interest.
R. Milton Johnson: Yes, minority interest, and then you'll see that tax rate be more in line with what you would expect.
Sheryl R. Skolnick - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division: And did you comment at all on cash flows, did I miss that?
R. Milton Johnson: I have not. We will be -- cash flow from operations for next year will probably be in the range of, call it, $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion -- or $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion sort of zone for next year. We will have, in our estimates, higher cash taxes. You will see, based upon the interest number I gave you, slightly higher interest paid in next year. And the CapEx target is going to be approximately $2 billion, which is up from the $1.862 billion this year. So we will see our cash flow from operations expectation is -- would be declined from this year's, I think, record number of $4.175 billion.
Operator: And we'll go next to Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I just wanted to clarify one thing on CapEx. Is there any way for you to break out for us what your IT expenditures are going to be, if that's the swing factor in terms of it growing? So that's a clarification. And then maybe just more of a philosophical question I have for you. We've seen a lot of different organizations respond to some of the CMMI initiatives and some of the payment models that CMMI has been putting out. I guess the question here is, what's HCA's approach to some of this? And do you plan on participating in any of these models? And I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about those opportunities.
Richard M. Bracken: I'll mention one thing on the CapEx, and then maybe, Juan, you can talk a little bit about the CMMI initiatives, or Sam, whoever wants to take that one on. Our CapEx for next year is, from a composition basis, is pretty much similar to what it was this year. We stepped it up a little bit in terms of what we term our routine spend. That's just the spend that goes to fundamental facilities, clinical equipment and the like. So we don't really see a major breakout in technology spending or any major changes in sort of the components of our CapEx allocation.
Samuel N. Hazen: Yes, let me start on the CMI projects that you were mentioning, Darren. The company clearly evaluates any opportunity and any new program that comes out, and we do it with our folks in the field. We evaluate our programs, our position in the marketplace, our position capability and so forth. And we went through the process on the most recent program that was discussed around bundled payments and so forth. And we chose, at this particular point in time, not to pursue participating in those initiatives. We felt there were other initiatives that made more sense for our organization at that particular point in time. We do have a number of tests and pilot programs with various payers across the marketplace, both with our physicians as well as our facilities to understand what impact they have and how we would think about them in other situations across the company. And so we're very connected to that process. It's just that when we don't have enough details or we don't have the necessary situation in place where it makes sense at the time, we make the decision as we do our evaluation. And that's pretty much how we handle this bundled project program that the government was pushing through the industry. And across HCA's markets, there's very few systems that actually participated, and I think it just reflects the other opportunities that exist within those markets.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. I just wanted to understand if there was anything that we should think about as far as investments that you guys are making to prepare for 2014? We hear a lot about it from the managed care side of things, but haven't really heard about it from the hospital side. Is there anything that you need to do as far as staffing up in front of that potential volume increase in 2014 or investments around contracting or narrow networks or thinking about risk, or anything along those lines that we should be thinking about as the year goes on?
Samuel N. Hazen: This is Sam again. I think Richard mentioned in his comments and Milton alluded to it as well, and I just mentioned that we do have a few pilot concepts that we're exploring that aren't necessarily applicable to reform per se. They're just the dynamics that exist within our markets, and we're responding to that. One thing we have done as we studied our capacity, I think, very carefully is to understand where do we have capacity constraints that we need to address, whether that's with access within a market, whether that's with beds or other capabilities within our facilities. But again, that's sort of normal business for HCA. I wouldn't say it's anything new because of reform. If we do see a spike in demand within our markets like some people assume as reform develops, then we'll have to continually adjust our capacity if our share continues to maintain itself. But that's still sort of normal course of operations for the company. We have a very disciplined approach to understanding our utilization of our facilities, our occupancy rates, our clinical technology needs and so forth, our physician needs. And as we work our way through the market dynamics, study the behaviors of the market, we will adjust as we've been adjusting to the dynamics up to this point. So I don't think you'll see anything dramatically different for the company as we move through the next 18 to 24 months.
Richard M. Bracken: You clearly wouldn't see any additions in variable staffing or anything. That will all be handled on a as-needed basis very close to the time of demand. So we wouldn't see any kind of sort of labor associated with that. The only sort of incidental labor that I would mention that -- and is not really related to reform, is, to Sam's point as to overall sort of market conditions, is our continued investment in our quality agenda, our quality performance teams, our ability to deploy the EHR and Meaningful Use and the like. And those areas we continue to invest labor to prepare ourselves for the future.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Whit Mayo from Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Wonder [ph] if you would answer this directly but, Milton, was just curious what the actual assumption is you're making for the uninsured declines in that $200 million cut from DSH. And do you have an idea actually when the CBO is going to publish their assumption for uninsured decline?
R. Milton Johnson: Yes, Whit, so what we know, there was a call and a document that was issued by CMS is the basis for our estimates. And basically today, as you're probably aware, DSH is distributed or allocated based upon Medicaid and SSI recipient days. And the new formula would be going to what's uncompensated care. And right now the way that uncompensated care is being designed is, with my understanding, would be charity care and bad debts and then that's multiplied by the cost of charge ratio. Well, what that formula does, it penalizes efficient providers. And also, what it doesn't pick up would be uninsured discounts. And as you know from following the company over a number of years, we give significant uninsured discounts to our uninsured patients. And that's not picked up in the uncompensated care formula, at least not as we understand it today. So as a result, it's not based upon a volume metric, this 75% redistribution, but based upon uncompensated care and the way that's being defined, and then the fact that efficient providers with a lower cost of charge ratio, again, would be hurt in this redistribution and that's the -- the $200 million is the effect upon HCA.
Victor L. Campbell: Yes, and I guess I'd direct you to that call that Milton mentioned was a public call. It was on January 8, and I think there's some slides and information on the CMS website. So again, it's preliminary. We're still waiting for the actual proposed rule to come, but we had to put something in our numbers as we develop guidance for the year.
Richard M. Bracken: And Whit, your comment about the reduction in the uninsured, so as you just heard, this redistribution formula, the $200 million is not attributable to reduced uninsured patients in our facilities. It's attributable to a new formula. And going forward, as health care reform is implemented, the number of uninsured do decrease that pool that would decrease further over time.
Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Yes, I know -- I mean, it was my assumption that the CBO was just going to make an estimate, and that's what the entire industry had to base their calculation on. So I just wasn't sure if you had an idea when the CBO may actually disclose or publish that.
Victor L. Campbell: No, we really don't. I tell you, with that, we want to thank everyone. We got done within the hour. So thank you very much. You all have a great day. Mark and I are here all day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the HCA Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I’d like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor L. Campbell: All right, thank you very much and good morning everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome all of you on today’s call, including those who are listening on the webcast. With me here this morning is our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operations. And we have several other members of the senior management team here with us as well to assist during the Q&A. Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today’s call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management’s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today’s press release and in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the company’s future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. And as you heard, the call is being recorded and replay will be available later today. With that, I’d turn the call over to Richard Bracken.
Richard M. Bracken: Thank you, Vic and good morning to all. With Hurricane Sandy and the storms creating so much destruction and chaos in the Northeast, we do very much appreciate those of you who are able to join us on our call this morning. Our thoughts are with all of you as you are dealing with the aftermath of this horrible storm. Before Milton and Sam provide details on our third quarter performance, let me take a moment to provide a couple of thoughts. On balance, we were pleased with the results of the third quarter. Our volume trends continue to show stable growth, market share trends remain favorable, patient acuity or case mix continue to increase consistent with recent quarterly trends, expense management was aligned with expectations, and we were recognized for some success in our quality performance agenda. However, revenues per unit continue to be under pressure and to some extent, offset certain of these more favorable metrics. All-in-all, the quarter close within our general expectations and of course, we will talk about all of this in just a minute. Through the first nine months of 2012, the company has achieved adjusted EBITDA of $4.925 billion or growth of 11.4%, compared to the prior year. On a same facility basis, year-to-date admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.6% and 3.8% respectively, slightly ahead of our expectations. We have now experienced 20 consecutive quarters of positive equivalent admissions growth. Year-to-date, same facility growth rate of emergency visits was robust at 7.2%. Importantly, we believe adjusted EBITDA performance is on track for our full-year and our reconfirming our previously stated guidance for 2012. On October 23, the company’s Board of Directors approved a special cash dividend of $2.50 per share. The record dates for this dividend is November 2, with a payment date of November 16 and we are pleased to be able to provide this special dividend to our shareholders. We are confident that this dividend will not impede our ability to invest in our markets or negatively affect our ability to make acquisition. The impact of this dividend on the company’s leverage is modest taking us from a 4.1 times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at September 30 to a pro forma ratio of 4.3 times and you may recall this leverage ratio was 4.5 times at December 31 last year. During October, we were able to complete two important financing transactions. First, we issued $2.5 billion of public notes with 10.5 year maturities that historically low interest rate, which was comprised of $1.25 billion of secured notes with a 4.75% coupon and a $1.25 billion of unsecured notes with a 5.875% coupon. In addition, we replaced our cash flow, revolving credit facility extending the maturity to November 2016 and lowering by 100 basis points, the borrowing spread schedule take effects later this month. We are appreciative of the strong support. We continue to receive in the debt capital market. We were also pleased that certain of our quality improvement efforts were recognized in the quarter. In September, the Joint Commission published its list of top performers, a national ranking based on accreditation agency’s analysis of objective, public accountability measures of clinical performance, 96 of HCA’s 135 license affiliated hospitals slightly over 70% were included in the listing of top performing hospitals. Also we recently announced results of a national wide study concerning optimal methods to reduce hospital-acquired infections. This collaborative effort, conducted with investigators from several academic institutions and research program at two U.S. Department of Health and Human Service Agencies, The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention focused on the reduction of blood stream infections. The study was conducted exclusively at 43 HCA affiliated hospitals, and defines current best practices to prevent MRSA and center line infections, improve clinical outcomes and reduce avoidable resource utilizations. We are proud of our role in this important study and believe the results will be helpful to the industry. We are now in the process of rolling out all of these recommended procedures at all remaining HCA facilities. And finally, in closing these opening remarks, last week we announced the retirement of two senior officers of the company, Paul Rutledge and Russ Harms each has been with the company for a decade and has contributed greatly to our success. We wish to publicly thank them for all their contributions and leadership. And with that, let me turn the call to Milton and start on the quarter.
R. Milton Johnson: Well, thank you Richard and good morning to all. I hope most of you have had a chance to review our third quarter earnings release, which was released this morning and is consistent with our previous earnings from October 16. As a remainder, we’ve again consolidating our Denver HealthONE venture in November of 2011. Therefore their results are included in our consolidated numbers, but not in our same facility results. To summarize our third quarter, we saw a solid volume growth, although somewhat less than recent trends. Our same facility case mix increased to all financial classes, compared to the prior year. And expenses management continued to be in line with recent trends, albeit against tough comps from last year’s third quarter. Same facility total case mix increased 0.4% in the third quarter, consistent with our second quarter result. Revenues in the third quarter increased 11.1% to $8.062 billion, primarily reflecting the consolidation of our HealthONE venture and increase patient volume. Same facility revenues increased 3.3% in the quarter, adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.533 billion, an increase of 8.6% in the prior year $1.412 billion. Same facility adjusted EBITDA increased 3% in the third quarter, compared to the prior year with our same facility adjusted EBITDA margin declining 10 basis points to 19.9%, as compared to the third quarter of 2011. Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. totaled $360 million or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to $61 million or $0.11 per diluted share in last year’s third quarter. The third quarter results for 2011 included pre-tax losses on retirement of debt of $406 million or $0.49 per diluted share. For the third quarter, volume trends were strong with same facility admissions increasing 2.1% and same facility equivalent machines increasing 2.6% against difficult volume comps last year’s third quarter when we experienced growth of 3.2% and 3.8% respectively. Our volume trends, especially admissions and surgical cases were adversely affected by one less business day in the quarter, compared to last year. Patient volume growth was primarily a function of growth in our same facility medical admissions of 4.1%, while same facility of surgical admissions declined 1.3%, compared to the prior year. Total admissions increased 7%, while equivalent admissions increased 8.3%, compared to the prior year. Same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.6% and 4% respectively in the third quarter. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 14.4% on a same facility basis and represent 26.5% of our total Medicare admission. Same-facility Medicaid admissions increased 2.7% with same-facility equivalent admissions increasing 3.8% in the quarter. Same-facility managed care and other admissions declined 1.2% in the third quarter and same-facility managed care and other equivalent admissions were basically flat year-over-year. Uninsured admissions increased 7.3% on the same-facility basis in the third quarter compared to the prior year. The growth in uninsured admits accounts for approximately 55 basis points of the 2.1% same-facility admissions growth during the third quarter. Same-facility uninsured admissions represent 8.1% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 7.8% in the last year’s third quarter. Same-facility emergency room business remained strong increasing 7.4% in the quarter. On a consolidated basis, ER visits increased 12% for the third quarter compared to the prior year. Total same-facility surgeries declined 1.3% in the quarter, reflecting a decline of 2.1% in our inpatient surgeries, and 0.8% decline in our outpatient surgeries on the same-facility basis. Year-to-date through September, same-facility surgical volumes remain relatively flat with inpatient surgeries down 0.4% and outpatient surgeries up 0.6%. Same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 0.7% in the third quarter. Although a low growth rate, this is highest rate of revenue per equivalent admission growth in the past year. Several factors are influencing our rate, including Medicaid rate reductions in Florida and Texas and changes in service and payer mix. During the third quarter, the same-facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission declined 0.3%. Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission declined 6.9%, and as expected, we did see less Medicaid rate pressure in Florida. But we continue to incur rate reductions in Texas through the third quarter. Same-facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.5% consistent with recent trends. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased $434 million in the third quarter compared to the prior year and during the third quarter, same-facility charity care discounts totaled $766 million, an increase of $90 million from the prior year, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $1.784 billion, an increase of $344 million in the prior year. We were pleased with our overall expense management in the quarter. As we anticipated, the year-over-year comparisons became more difficult in the third quarter. Same-facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2% in the quarter compared to prior year. However, sequentially our operating expense per equivalent admission in the third quarter was basically flat for the second quarter of 2012. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 4.1% on the same-facility basis, same facility productivity performance is measured by man hours per equivalent admission increased slightly over the prior year and same-facility wage rate growth was 1.6% in the third quarter. Personnel costs associated with physician employment increased by $11 million, or 4.3% in the previous year’s third quarter. Same-facility supply costs per equivalent admission declined 1.6% in the prior year, reflecting less surgical volume, low supply cost inflation, and the company’s ongoing supply cost reduction initiatives. Same-facility other operating costs per equivalent admission increased 0.4% from the prior year. We recognized $131 million in electronic health record incentive income in the third quarter, consistent with our expectations. The company also incurred approximately $24 million in EHR-related expense in the quarter, compared to $14 million in the third quarter of 2011. Substantially, all of our hospitals have achieved the second year of Stage 1 meaningful use and expect to certify such during the fourth quarter. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $655 million in the quarter compared to $880 million last year. The decline was primarily due to a reduction of $145 million from changes in working capital items, including approximately $100 million increase in AR related to the Texas UPL program, and a $107 million from higher income tax payment. Days in accounts receivable at September 30, 2012 were 52 days, compared to 50 days at the same period last year. For the nine- months ended September 30, 2012, cash flow from operating activities totaled $2.9 billion and our free cash flow after CapEx and distributions to non-controlling interest totaled $1.34 billion. Finally, now having completed nine months of the year, we believe the company will complete the year 2012 at approximately the midpoint of our previously issued adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.37 billion to $6.6 2 billion. As for next year, we are currently in the process of building our budget for 2013, and we’ll provide 2013 guidance on our 2012 fourth quarter earnings call. However, as a reminder, 2012 results include two significant items that should be considered as you model for 2013. One, the Medicare Rural Floor settlement net of the SSI ratio charge added $170 million to our first quarter 2012 adjusted EBITDA, which will not reoccur in 2013. Secondly, we expect 2012 high tech incentive income of approximately $334 million to decline by approximately 115 million in 2013, that’s consistent with the federal incentive payment schedule. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Sam.
Samuel N. Hazen: Good morning. I’ll begin my comments this morning with more detail on the company’s volume trends for the quarter and then provide an update on inpatient market share for the first quarter of 2012. Volume growth across the company’s 14 domestic divisions was very balanced again this quarter. On a year-over-year basis, 12 out for 14 domestic divisions had growth in same facility inpatient admissions. 13 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth same facility adjusted admissions. All divisions had growth in same facility emergency room against this quarter, reflecting continued success with our many initiatives to gain share in this service line. 11 out of our 14 divisions had growth in managed care emergency room visits, which were up 4.2%. And finally, EMS visits to our hospitals grew by 5.2%, all but one division had growth in this area. Surgical volumes were weak this quarter, but we believe most of this was due to the number of business days in the quarter. This year, we had one less business day in the quarter as compared to last year. Approximately 96% of all surgeries in our hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers are done on business days. When we look at same-facility total surgeries per business day, our volumes for the quarter were slightly up as compared to prior year. Our surgical growth initiative, which I highlighted on our first quarter call is progressing well for the company. Same-facility admissions into adult intensive care and neonatal intensive care units this quarter were up 3.8% and 3.4% respectively. The improvement in our neonatal volume is driven mostly by growth in obstetrics admissions, which grew by 1.7%. This rate of growth is an improvement over the rate in the first half of the year. Now, let me transition to some market share highlights for the 12 months ending first quarter 2012. Again, this is the most current data available and it represents almost 90% of the company’s market. First, the company’s overall market share during this period increased by 44 basis points to 23.2%. Second, we gain market share on a sequential basis when comparing the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011. This followed sequential market share gains in both the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2011, as compared to the respective preceding quarter. We gain market share in 13 out of 17 service lines that we monitor. HCA had market share gains in 28 of 37 markets with strong growth in all major Texas markets, Denver, Miami, Nashville, Richmond, and Las Vegas. We had market share growth in both the commercial and in migration segments of our business. And finally, overall market demand for this period grew by 0.7%, which is a slight acceleration from the same period 12 months ago. If we use this growth rate as a proxy for inpatient demand in the second and third quarters, we believe HCA has increased its market share during these periods also. We are continually enhancing our growth plans while leveraging what we are learning across the company. This effort is allowing us to improve the key elements of our plan which are service line development, real outreach efforts, increasing access to our systems and physician engagement. Additionally, we continue investing in capital to increase capacity in growth markets and to improve the technology offerings in our facilities making them more attractive to our physicians and patients. For example, HCA has announced the development of three new hospitals that will expand our footprint in three markets, Salt Lake City, Houston and Orlando. We are currently evaluating three others and expect to announce one of these soon. These hospitals will be smaller, community-based hospitals that are intended to serve growing communities and support HCA’s larger networks in the respective markets. Two of these will open in 2013, and the others will open by the end of 2014. We believe these efforts to learn are capital investments and solid execution are combining to drive these gains in market share. With that, I’ll turn the call back to Vic for questions.
Victor L. Campbell: All right, thank you, Sam. Thank you everyone for participating. We’ll now move to Q&A and as always encourage you to limit your calls to one, so we can give everyone an opportunity. Operator, do you want to pick up.
Operator: Certainly, sir. Today’s question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically (Operator Instructions) And we’ll first go to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning. Quick question, you referenced Florida and Texas with regard to Medicaid, but I was hoping you could go back and talk a little bit in detail about Texas, you mentioned the build-up in the Texas UPL AR. So, any color around that and how you see these programs playing out over the next 6 to 12 months? Thanks.
David G. Anderson: Thank you, Frank. Milt, you want that?
R. Milton Johnson: Sure. The Texas UPL program referenced the impact it had on our cash flow of about $100 million. We saw, basically in the third quarter, we did not receive our payment that we typically would receive and it’s just going to be a timing difference. So our receivable from the program increased by approximately $100 million during the quarter and I see that coming back to us in the fourth quarter. With respect to Medicaid, we anniversaried the significant cuts in Florida at the end of June. So at the end of the second quarter, if you look at our year-to-date, we’ve been where Medicaid is down almost a 11% on a rate basis for the company year-to-date through the nine months, of course, down just under 7% for this third quarter, and that’s what we expected. So what we are going through now primarily we do have still some small cuts in Florida that we are going through, a second round of cuts, but much less significant than what we went through last year or through June 30 of this year. And then we are going through the Texas cuts, which on an annualized basis, would probably be in the neighborhood of $80 million or so. And that should anniversary the end of, here at the end of the third quarter.
David G. Anderson: All right. Milt, either you or John have sort of any update, anything to say about Texas waiver and the status of that, or Sam?
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, this is Sam. John is not available on the call. But we are still in the regulatory infernal, sort of documentation phase, if you will, for the UPL program or the waiver program. And all of those details still are not known at this particular point in time. It’s our belief through the process that changes that will be made should be more modest than what we’ve experienced this year as it relates to reduction. So there could be some reductions here and there, but it won’t be anything near as material as what it has been.
David G. Anderson: Frank, thank you.
Frank Morgan – RBC Capital Markets: Thank you.
Operator: And next we’ll go to Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Colleen Elizabeth Lang – Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Hi, good morning. This is Colleen Lang on for Tom. Just on the pricing, I think that comp that eases significantly in Q4 particularly on the managed care front. Are you more optimistic that pricing will improve in the fourth quarter, or is mix still a headwind?
David G. Anderson: Milton.
R. Milton Johnson: Sure. Well, on the Medicare front, we would expect it to improve as we receive, I think, it’s a 2.3% increase and so for the year. So that will be positive for pricing starting in the fourth quarter. With respect to managed care, I would remain a little more cautious there with respect to saying, increases year-to-date were up about 4.5% what we’ve been yielding on the managed care book. And that’s primarily due as you referenced to service mix issues. And so, I would not expect that to change drastically in the fourth quarter, but I do see the governmental fees from Medicare being an improvement for us.
David G. Anderson: Thanks, Colleen.
Colleen Elizabeth Lang – Lazard Capital Markets LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to Josh Raskin with Barclays Barclays.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just a question a little bit more about as you’re preparing for 2014, and I’m just curious what of efforts HCA is going to undertake around branding and maybe awareness around some of your quality outcomes, especially relative to the broader industry. And I don’t know if there is any way to quantify, any impact on what you’re seeing in terms of contracting for 2014, or just still too earlier to even have those conversations with payers, but just be curious on the adverse there?
Victor L. Campbell: All right, Josh. Thank you. Richard, you want to take a shot at the hammer?
Richard M. Bracken: I was hoping somebody would ask a question on quality. We include this in our remarks to this audience, because we think our efforts at systematically reducing negative and unnecessary clinical variation across our provider system is of the highest priority. And it’s not only the highest priority, because it’s the best thing to do for the patients and the care that they get. But it also aligned with more efficient care and given the changes that we focus on in this industry that is certainly paramount among them. In terms of branding, I wouldn’t look for us to really brand these activities at such. We are so proud of the many successes that we’ve achieved. We roll them out across our enterprise on all sorts of measures, whether it’s how we’ve been able to improve patient wait times in our EDs or our perinatal initiatives or our 39 week standard, reduction of MRSA like we commented on today. This is the fundamentals of providing good healthcare and they wouldn’t rise to sort of an external branding effort. We will and do talk to our payer communities and our provider communities about these efforts. We think they’re substantial. We think they add tremendous value and when we can pull this out, over a wide number of assets and physicians, we make a significant difference. So I guess the short answer is that this is an important part of our operating agenda. We think it’s going to create a lot of value going forward. Where we have put economics return in it tends to be more around the supply chain side of the equation whereby we just want to say or minimizing complications we’re able to save on supplies, and we quantify that and increasingly putting that in our projection. But really want this will build into our overall cost of care, and as they become more hardwired in our overall performance it will show up in our projection numbers going forward. That’s kind of how we think about it. We don’t want to get too far out there. We think there is a lot of future there. But we really don’t put it into our projections that we really can see very tangible evident.
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: 2014…
Victor L. Campbell: Mill, you want to add…?
R. Milton Johnson: Yeah, you mentioned where we’re contracting, if you’re referring just commercial contracting under our traditional contracts…
Joshua Raskin – Barclays Capital: Yeah.
R. Milton Johnson: …60% to 65% of our revenues under contract for 2014. But if you’re referring to exchanges for 2014, there is really nothing material going on there. The states I think waiting largely on the elections to make any make or move with respect to exchanges. We are experimenting on a small scale with some ACOs, both Medicare Advantage and commercial ACOs are very, very small. But at least we’re starting there and starting to take look at some of those, and looking at clinical integrated network. Richmond is probably the most advanced for us there on that front, and looking at a few other markets. So we are starting to prepare for healthcare reform. But as of today, I would say these steps are relatively small and pilots at this point.
Victor L. Campbell: Josh, thank you.
Operator: And next we’ll go to A.J. Rice with UBS.
A.J. Rice – UBS: Yes, hello everybody. I guess, I would just ask the ACA. In the last few months has been mentioned with a number of potential transactions out there and obviously we’re seeing the entire backdrop on consolidation activity heat up as we head to 2014. Can you just maybe comment on what you’re seeing in terms of activity level and the company’s capacity? I know you commented on the debt-to-EBITDA, but the company’s financial that manage your capacity to pursue transactions and your appetite for that?
Richard M. Bracken: A.J., this is Richard. Let me just make a start at this. As I said in my comments today, we feel we have plenty capacity in our balance sheet to pursue any strategic acquisition that we choose to. I would also add that we are seeing more activity I mean whole industrial seeing it as various institutions and systems across America. Think about the future and how to achieve and scale it up in an increasingly difficult environment. We certainly see a lot of that. I would also add as I always add that we are disciplined in terms of what we want to do and how we want to, what we want to pay. We have seen a lot. We’re at the table for a lot, and we are pretty firm about what we think we should be spending and the value that we can bring to these assets. So it’s certainly an active part of our management team right now. I will also just remind all of you that we were thinking that this would be the trend in the business and several years ago really revamped our development program, added a lot of talent there, not only on the transactional side, but on the overall sort of development side. So we’re feeling that we’re appropriately positioned to respond to a changing M&A environment.
David G. Anderson: I don’t know Milton, if you want to add about the balance sheet in here.
R. Milton Johnson:  Well, I mean, I think we’ve talked about our leverage ratios. I think that we have an opportunity to pursue acquisitions with our balance sheet and feel very comfortable with that.
David G. Anderson: A.J., thank you.
Operator: And next we’ll go to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital Group: Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you so much for making the non-800 number available and for your kind thoughts and wishes about, both of us out here, still dealing with things. Almost makes me sorry, I’m going to ask you a question that you might don’t want to answer. Could you give us an update on a couple of things that are, we’ll call it compliance and/or reimbursement oversight related, such as New York Times/Miami U.S. Attorney’s Office inquiry and where that’s standing if there has been any local fallout that you can see, or any steps that you’ve taken? You want to talk about the incidents of the rack pilot beginning the Mac prepayments and other audits. And also as I understand that managed care is becoming an increasingly vigilant in oversight on observation cases in a caring is the new Interpol standards. I would be curious if you’ve seen any evidence of that either through managed care oversight activities or Medicare or investigative oversight activities. And thank you.
David G. Anderson: Sheryl, thank you, and we’re thinking about you guys up there. Milt, do you want to take that, Alan Yuspeh is not with us here today, but I know he and Milton have been talking about all of these issues?
R. Milton Johnson: Yeah, I’m not going to address the New York Times. I’ll say that to the lawyers that have got anything to add, but with respect to the rack audits and the observation and short stay sort of issues, let me say that we have been experiencing an increase in the amount of rack activity. And they have been emphasizing the sum that patients as either inpatient or outpatient, has been the area of focus. We have developed elaborate systems and with our shared service centers, Parallon, to respond to these request. We’ve had to add a significant number of people to handle some of the volumes. But we have found that almost all of the rack patient status denials merit an appeal and our shared service teams and our attorneys are appealing these denials. We’ve had substantial success with the cases reviewed by the administrative law judges, and we put in place the extensive measures to try to ensure the correct patient status assignments, and we feel that the rack denials in the space are generally incorrect. And we’ve had no experience, our rack experience at this point does not had any material effect on our financial performance, especially here in the third quarter, but again we’re seeing an increased amount of activity. With respect to the observation in short-stay, our observation rate, so it’s the observation as a percentage of observation plus short-stay, we continue to be around a 11% that’s been our percentage now for consistently for a couple of years. So we’re not seeing any, any increase in our observation. Also when you look at one-day stays, Medicare one-day stays, we’re seeing our Medicare one-day stays grow at approximately the same rates as our overall Medicare volumes. So nothing really to distinguish anything there.
David G. Anderson: All right. And Sheryl, I will be the lawyer here. I’ve already gotten the nod. There really is no update on anything as it relates to the New York Times and related investigation issue, and I might add in talking to Sam, and our Board of folks, we have seen no business impact at all operationally as a result of that story.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital Group:  That’s perfect. Thanks so much.
Victor L. Campbell: Thanks, Sheryl.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) We’ll next go to John Ransom with Raymond James.
John Ransom – Raymond James:  Hi, just a couple of things, you guys over the past two years have obviously given investors a nice dividend. Do you think that’s kind of one of these recurring, non-recurring things or do you think it’s subject to tax law changes in your current ownership structure, which is majority private equity?
Victor L. Campbell: Milt, do you want that?
R. Milton Johnson: When the decisions for a special dividend versus other alternatives for use of capital, really we take into account all of that market factors. And you mentioned a few of them could be tax rate impact for dividends, if that changes drastically maybe that would indicate that a share repurchase might be more attractive. The cost of debt capital is a major factor. The timing of certain cash needed for acquisitions would be a factor. The cash that we would need, if we want to step up investment in our existing markets for example, would be a consideration. So there is a number of factors that we look at as we think about special dividend. Here over recent months of course, we’ve been an environment where we’ve been generating substantial cash flow. We haven’t had a substantial need of cash for a new acquisition outside of HealthONE. And credit markets continue to be very favorable with the cost of debt capital. And at the same time, we believe that our shareholders appreciate the opportunity to have a cash yield on their investment. So all those factors have let us to use our capital for special dividends, but going forward we’re not going to try to predict how we’re going to continue that, it would be continuing to consider all those factors from time-to-time and making up decisions.
John Ransom – Raymond James:  Okay. And then secondly, as we think about 2013, I know you’re not giving guidance. But could you give us your best guess as to first half of the year, second half of the year, net Medicaid pricing? I mean obviously there is a substantial headwind this year, but what is that look like next year? Also factoring in which thing might be happening with Texas UPL? Thanks.
Victor L. Campbell: Yeah, I think at this point. John, we’re not going to address that. The Medicaid will be part of the pricing, discussion it will have, when we give our guidance going forward. But obviously we can’t address lot of these things. We’re sitting here with a sequester on the books that some people say are going way, so we just sort of draw the line here and say let’s just as Mil remained you a couple things that you and many others are aware of that our big non-recurring items in terms of the rural floor settlement and the difference in the high-tech income or things that are known and we can tell you now. But the other issues, we’re going to wait until to do our four quarter call.
Operator:  Okay. Next we’ll go to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Great, thanks. I appreciate the color on the volume number, which seems like it’s probably going to be the best volume number we see from the group again this quarter. But I was wondering, in the past I didn’t hear some of the same color or commentary about some of things that were maybe weak. This quarter as far as volume, I think in the past obviously you talked about the in patient, in sight volume growth, can you just flush out again kind of little more about what about headwinds of volume and other two items.
Victor L. Campbell: All right, Kevin. Sam, do you want to…
Samuel N. Hazen: Yeah, let me just color some service lines volumes here. Our Behavioral Health initiative continues to produce strong volume for the company. We were up 6% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. A rehab initiative, which is following our behavioral initiative, it’s not as far down the road with very strong at 13.5%. As we said, the weakness in our volume was primarily surgery, which we attribute mostly to the business day mix that we had in the quarter. On the cardiology side, we were flattish on our cardiology volume on the procedural side. We were up on the medical side as we have been. When you look at the surgical components, the one service line that continues to really out phase all service lines as orthopedics, orthopedics surgical volumes are growing nicely and then we had some softness in the others. But again, when you normalize it for the business day mix, nothing sticks out as dramatically down. I will tell you that on our market share metrics, the two service lines at a very granular level where we had some deterioration that we’re trying to study and understand a little more is on cardiovascular surgery itself, open heart and valve procedures were actually up, we think on value. But we’re down on open heart. That was one area that was softer than we had anticipated. And so we have to study that a little bit further to understand the reasons for that. But pretty good volume metrics like I mentioned before across the Board on the other things.
Richard M. Bracken: Sam, like we saw deliveries up, and NICU activity up in the quarter.
Samuel N. Hazen: Right, I mentioned that in the call. That’s right. And so that was a little bit of trend change actually on the Neonatal side, we had length of stay improvement this quarter as compared to the first half of the year. We had length of stay compression on Neonatal activity.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right, got it. Thank you.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Gary Taylor with Citi.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: I’m Gary, it sounds like I’m Barry today. I like that. I have one clarification and one question. So I hope I can slip both past Vic’s firewall he’s got up there.
Victor L. Campbell: I’ll listen to him first.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Okay. The clarification is so you expect 2012 EBITDA, the midpoint of your previous range, which I believe midpoint would be about $695 billion. I just want to make sure we should be using that year-to-date EBITDA $4,925 billion in terms of calculating what the stub guidance would essentially be for the fourth quarter? But there’s no other adjustments there?
R. Milton Johnson: Yeah, Gary, this is Milton. And of course you’re doing the math and you should be using our year-to-date EBITDA all-in GAAP numbers. I know you’re backing into the fourth quarter number…
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Yeah.
R. Milton Johnson: And I hate to take it to an absolute point estimate, but if you think about probably from $1.550 billion to $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter in that landing zone.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Yeah.
R. Milton Johnson: And the midpoint of that range would put you pretty much on $6.5 billion.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: And HIT should drop sequentially right, we have around $80 million, is that ballpark?
Samuel N. Hazen: The total for the year, we gave it.
R. Milton Johnson: No, I think it’s more than that. I think what we are looking at for the full-year be $334 billion.
Samuel N. Hazen: Right.
R. Milton Johnson: And we’ve got a $195 billion through three quarters, Gary…
Mark Kimbrough: This is Mark. We’ve talked about healthcare HIT, 40% of our expected revenue recognition would be in the third quarter and I believe we’re expecting about 25% of the annualized number in the fourth quarter.
R. Milton Johnson: We’ve got year-to-date, so now we’re at $252 million
Mark Kimbrough: It’s right. You’re right. I was looking at the impact on EBITDA net of expenses that’s right. Just looking at the income number, it’s about $80 million.
Victor L. Campbell: All right, that would work. What’s your other question?
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Sam or maybe for Richard, on the topic of exchanges, I get this question from investors a lot and I have my own view. But I thought if you guys want to talk about your view. Obviously, substantial unknown isn’t just how many people actually end up in these exchanges or the timing of that. But what payment rates, your hospitals are going to see from subsidized plans in those exchanges. And I guess in the absence of any rate caps or public plans with mandated government rates, the view is I would think that these are plans run by commercial companies are going to have to sit down and negotiate with you just like they do for your existing plans and their ability to just dictate a Medicaid or Medicare type rate doesn’t really existing in that in a negotiation. Is that how you’re thinking about it and expecting that it falls out somewhere closer to commercial rates?
Richard M. Bracken: I think a lot of the dynamics will unfold as depending on the election and who’s in and how it shape. But I think generally they will be competitively negotiated rates and that’s the way that we’re thinking about it. Obviously, we would like them to be a lot closer to the commercial book, but who knows exactly where all that’s going to shake out. But that would be a sort of I guess how we are thinking about it.
Samuel N. Hazen: The process you described accurately.
R. Milton Johnson: Yeah.
Samuel N. Hazen: Don’t know where it’s going to land when we go through the process, but the process would be negotiation with…
R. Milton Johnson: Right.
Samuel N. Hazen: With commercial players.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Great, thank you.
David G. Anderson: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: And next we’ll go to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank Securities: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to just ask about expense growth. And I wanted to just get a little bit more thought from you about how, you are looking at expense growth in light on what could be a tougher year with sequestration for 2013. How are you planning for that? And I wouldn’t like to just get some additional comments about physician employment costs and how you are thinking about the growth of that?
R. Milton Johnson: All right. Well, I don’t want to get in, again, too much into 2013. I think that we want to cover that in our thinking and assumptions next quarter when we do the fourth quarter call. But on a big picture we expect that we are going to continue to be a low inflationary environment and we are going to continue to see that impact on wage rates, on supply costs and other operating expenses. With respect to things like our physician cost and physician employment, I think that that will be an area where again, depending on the market we’ll probably see some growth. But I think the growth much like you are seeing now would be at a more moderate growth rate than what we’ve experienced a year ago, or 18 months ago from just a big picture outlook.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank Securities: And on the physician piece itself just, I know you gave us the actual growth rate and expenditure which I think you said was 4.3%. Can you just may be update us briefly on your employed physician base and, any comments on physician practice losses running through the P&L?
Samuel N. Hazen: This is Sam, Darren. We have approximately 3,200 physicians that we employ across HCA’s markets. That’s up from the previous year, I don’t have the exact growth rate in front of me, but it’s up 150 to 200 physicians thereabouts. What we have done is we have learned a lot from the decisions that we have made over the previous years and have been able to refine our thinking around how to deploy this component of our strategy in a way that accomplishes our strategic objectives accomplishes our clinical objectives and puts us in a position where we accomplish our economic objectives to be perfectly candid. And we’ve done that by being, I think more selective in the processing of these decisions, number one, we’ve also been able to assimilate these practices more effectively as we’ve established systems and capabilities within our physician practice management arm. Do we see more of it going forward, yes, is it going to be at a rapid pace. I don’t think so not across all of HCA’s markets. Some markets faster than others clearly, but across the portfolio, I don’t see any more rapid movement. For HCA, about 10% to 12% of our activity is from employed physicians. We still depend on our affiliated physicians in a very significant way. We have added probably a 1,000 to 1,200 new active staff physicians to our hospitals this year on a base of about 35,000. That’s come through recruitment. It’s come through employment. It’s come through relocating physicians in a market to our campus. So there’s a host of things that go on in our medical staff development initiative, employment just being one piece, but that’s where we stand with the, sort of that component of our business.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank Securities: That’s great. Thanks.
Samuel N. Hazen: Thanks, Darren.
Operator: And next we’ll go to Kevin Campbell with Avondale Partners.
Kevin Campbell – Avondale Partners LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was curious if you guys could just maybe just some color about what you are doing to address the hospital readmission penalties and specifically what you are doing to lower readmission?
David G. Anderson: All right. You want to take a shot at that one? Jon Perlin, our Chief Medical Director.
Dr. Jonathan B. Perlin: Thanks. First, I appreciate the question. We do perform better than the industry a large, but there is obviously room for improvement. We’re working with our case management function to better coordinate the care between our inpatient and outpatient settings. The fact that we have the number of employed physicians that Sam mentioned, as well as very tight relationships with affiliated physicians, eases the hands off and our implementation of electronic health records assures the continuity of information to make sure the patients’ needs are met as effectively as possible.
Samuel N. Hazen: This is Sam. Let me just add what Jon said. We have probably 20 hospitals that we’ve targeted very selectively with more aggressive initiatives to see what impact we can have around some of these tactics that Jon just mentioned. And we’re studying those and really engaged in those very intently. And I think, from there, we will learn, and as we learn, we start to transport those learnings across the company. And so those 20 are getting a significant amount of scrutiny and support from the corporate office to understand what work and what doesn’t work with impacting this particular issue.
Kevin Campbell – Avondale Partners LLC: Can you give any color on what those initiatives might be at those 20 hospitals?
Samuel N. Hazen: It varies. It depends on some of the service lines and so forth. We could probably do that better off-line, because there is a host of things we are working on. We’ve got nurse navigation, we have discharge planning, we have follow-up with certain pharmacy, okay. I mean, there is a litany of things that we’re trying to do that to have an impact.
Kevin Campbell – Avondale Partners LLC: Okay, I will follow up off-line. Thank you.
Samuel N. Hazen: Thank you.
David G. Anderson: All right. Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: And next we’ll go to Jake Hindelong with Imperial Capital.
David G. Anderson: Jake, are you there?
Jake Hindelong – Imperial Capital, LLC: Yes, hey, good morning, everyone.
David G. Anderson: Good morning.
Jake Hindelong – Imperial Capital, LLC: Guys, another fourth quarter reporting question. Will the HealthONE number be in or not included in the same-facility numbers?
David G. Anderson: Not. It would be next year, starting in January.
Samuel N. Hazen: As we quoted that in November, as I recall, so it wasn’t a full quarter Jake, correct.
Jake Hindelong – Imperial Capital, LLC: Right. Got it, great. And then bigger picture just as you think about more activity in consolidation as you move towards the big changes in 2014, is the appropriate leverage target probably in the in the low fours or you comfortable with that 4.5 times level that you ended last year?
R. Milton Johnson: Jake, we view our range, I would say, from 3.5 times to 4.5 times and that would be based upon the development activities and the like. But I would say 3.5 times to 4.5 times is the zone. And as you know, we were at 4.1 before the dividend, so almost at the midpoint of that.
Jake Hindelong – Imperial Capital, LLC: Perfect. Thank you.
David G. Anderson: Jake, thank you.
Operator: And next we’ll go to Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if you could tell us what the percent of the inpatient and the adjusted admission growth came from the growth in Behavioral and Rehab?
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, I’ll have to do some math here, but just let me give you some top line color on that. This is Sam. Behavioral and Rehab only account for about 7% of HCA’s total admissions. And if you look at the percentage of our growth associated with that, it’s less than 20%.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. And so, I guess, the fall would be at some point you run into more difficult comps there, or is that so small, but it’s going to be quite a while?
Samuel N. Hazen: Well, again, I think we are starting to see the Behavioral slowdown, so that comp is getting more difficult. But in the overall composite rate of good for the company, it’s still such a small weighted impact that it doesn’t really move the needle that match. And then as Rehab continues to accelerate which we think it will, that will compensate a little bit for the Behavioral slowdown. And again, the Behavioral slowdown as we call it was 6%. We were up 12% year-to-date through the third quarter, 6% in the second quarter. And so it has slowed and we knew it was going to slow, but it’s not going to have a material impact on our composite rate.
R. Milton Johnson: Sam, I think, our emergency room service line is the key for the growth feed going forward.
Samuel N. Hazen: That’s right, yeah.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
David G. Anderson: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We’ll next go to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Thanks, good morning.
David G. Anderson: Good morning, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Can you give us the percentage of revenue that’s Medicare advantage and maybe separately managed Medicaid, and then along those lines just the minus, are those rates negotiated or do you just paid the Medicare and Medicaid price?
R. Milton Johnson: Well, I would say, the rates were negotiated, but obviously we have an anchor there that’s very public in terms of what Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service pricing would be in a particular market. But we do negotiate with the payers around then. I don’t have, well Medicaid, in total, absent the UPL program is about 9% or so of our total net revenue. Let’s see if I got it broken out here. So, okay, managed Medicare is 9% of our net revenue and
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Managed Medicare, I’m sorry?
R. Milton Johnson: Managed Medicare and Managed Medicaid is about 5%.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Okay, all right. And just in terms of your first comment on the negotiation, so there is an anchor understandably obviously, are you able to get rates above that, or not and then I guess, I asked the question in some ways. related to the coming exchanges and your ability to negotiate pricing manner or do you think that’s totally apples and oranges?
R. Milton Johnson: Well, markets vary and so we are going to have different experiences relative to fee-for-service pricing in different markets. So it’s not a uniformed across the company, sort of, response there.
Samuel N. Hazen: As you would imagine different strengths in different markets.
David G. Anderson: Thanks, Ralph. I would say we’ve got time for one last question if anybody is out there.
Operator: Okay. (Operator Instructions)
David G. Anderson: All right. I think we got everybody covered. I want to thank everybody for being on the call. Mark and I are here all day. So give us a call if you need any follow-ups and have a good day. And again, condolences to some of you, I know, have had direct hits on Sandy and I hope things get better for you and your families.

Operator:  Welcome to the HCA Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Release conference call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Victor Campbell: Jennifer, thank you, and good morning everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I would like to welcome everyone on today’s call, as well as those of you listening to the webcast. With me here this morning as usual is our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operations. Several other members of the senior management team are with us here as well to assist during the Q&A. Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today’s call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management’s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today’s press release and in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the Company’s future results are beyond the ability of the Company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. And as you heard, the call is being recorded with replay available later today. With that, let me turn the call over to Richard.
Richard Bracken: All right, thank you Vic and thanks to all for joining our call this morning. Let me just say at the outset that we were pleased with our overall performance in the second quarter. In general, we saw a continuation of trends that we’ve been reporting on in recent quarters; that is, favorable growth in patient volumes, effective expense management, and continued pressure on revenue rate growth. Regarding our revenue rate growth performance, patient acuity as measured by case mix index increased slightly, but we continued to see pressure from Medicaid revenue rate declines.  For the quarter consolidated and reported adjusted EBITDA increased 10.5% to $1.569 billion from $1.42 billion in the prior year, and same facility adjusted EBITDA increased 5.2%. Our volumes continued to trend favorably to the prior period. On a same facility basis, admissions and equivalent admissions increased 2.5% and 3.9% respectively, and on an as-reported basis admissions increased 7.7%. And please recall that these as-reported numbers reflect the consolidation of the Health One acquisition last year. We believe that our comprehensive service line strategy continues to provide a very firm foundation for this composite growth. As an example, behavioral health and inpatient rehab admissions each increased approximately 14% during the quarter. We have now experienced 19 consecutive quarters of positive equivalent admissions growth. Additionally, we continue to experience favorable growth trends in emergency visit volumes. As reported, emergency visit growth was 13.4% and 8.8% on a same facility basis. This performance is important in driving our overall admission levels since approximately 65% of our admissions come through our emergency department. Also, Sam will update in his remarks market share information. The Company reported favorable cash flows from operations in the second quarter totaling 1.46 billion. For the first six months of 2012, cash flow from operations totaled $2.257 billion. Capital expenditures totaled $449 million in the quarter and our leverage ratio, which was 4.46 times at the end of last year, has improved to 4.2 times at the end of the second quarter. I’d also like to mention Parallon’s recent agreement with LifePoint Hospitals to provide full revenue cycle outsourcing and full service purchasing and accounts payable sourcing services for their hospitals. We also extended our IT service agreement with LifePoint by four years and we are pleased with Parallon’s success over this past year and believe Parallon is well positioned to deliver solutions to improve cost efficiency and cash flow to other healthcare providers. Now before turning the call over to Milton, let me just add that we do expect a story, possibly two, to run in the New York Times as early as this week. Based on the feedback we’ve received and the questions we’ve been asked, we believe the stories will include several topic areas: first, our ownership structure; second, the quality of care including medical necessity for cardiac services at certain of our Florida hospitals and wound care; our use of the ACEP – American College of Emergency Physicians – evaluation and management guidelines in our emergency departments; and our approach to care for the uninsured. Obviously, we do not know the precise contents of the story but to give you some context as you consider the article, we are posting some related information on our website. Thanks again to our management teams for a solid performance for the quarter and to our clinicians and caregivers as they navigate in this period of change in America’s healthcare delivery system. And with that, let me ask Milton to say a few comments about the numbers.
Milton Johnson: Thank you, Richard, and good morning to all. Hopefully most of you have had an opportunity to review our second quarter earnings release issued this morning. I believe most of the numbers are fairly straightforward, but as a reminder the Health One consolidation is included in our reported results for the quarter; however, it is not included in our same facility stats. As Richard mentioned, the second quarter results were once again driven by strong same facility volume growth and excellent expense management. As we anticipated, our case mix stabilized in the second quarter with all payors showing increases in their case mix, with the exception of Medicaid which declined 1.1% compared to the prior year. Same facility total case mix for the Company increased 0.4% in the second quarter and our same facility adjusted EBITDA margin increased 30 basis points to 20.5% as compared to the second quarter of last year.  Revenues in the second quarter increased 11.9% to 8.112 billion, primarily driven by the consolidation of our Health One venture and increased patient volumes. Same facility revenues increased 3.8% in the second quarter compared to the prior year.  Net income attributable to HCA Holdings Inc. totaled 391 million or $0.85 per diluted share in the second quarter compared to 229 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011. Last year’s results include losses on retirement of debt of 75 million or $0.08 per diluted share.  For the second quarter, volume trends remain strong with same facility admissions increasing 2.5% and same facility equivalent admissions increasing 3.9%. Patient volume growth was primarily driven by increased same facility medical admissions of 4.1% while same facility surgical admissions declined 0.8% compared to the prior period. Total admissions, which include our Health One consolidation increased 7.7% and equivalent admissions increased 9.7% during the second quarter.  During the second quarter, same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.1% and 4.3% respectively. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 15.4% on a same facility basis and now represent 26.3% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 4% with same facility equivalent admissions increasing 6.6% in the second quarter compared to the prior year period. Same facility managed care and other admissions declined slightly – 0.7% in the second quarter; however, same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.4% in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarterly increase.  Same facility uninsured admissions increased 8.9% in the second quarter compared to the prior year second quarter. This growth in uninsured admissions accounted for 65 basis points of the 2.5% same facility admission growth during the quarter. Same facility uninsured admissions represent 7.8% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 7.4% in last year’s second quarter. Total surgeries were flat year over year on a same facility basis, reflecting modest growth in our outpatient surgeries while inpatient surgeries declined slightly. We continued to experience strong same facility emergency room visits in the second quarter, increasing 8.8% compared to the prior year. On a reported basis, emergency room visits increased 13.4%. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission declined 0.1% in the second quarter. As I have stated on several occasions, several factors are influencing our revenue per equivalent admission including Medicaid rate cuts in Florida and Texas and changes in both service mix and payor mix. In fact, if you look just at our combined same facility Medicare and managed care revenue per equivalent admission in the quarter, it increased by 2.5% compared to the prior year. Same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission increased 0.7% compared to the prior year and same facility Medicare case mix increased 0.6% in the second quarter. Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission declined 15.5%, and that’s generally consistent with recent quarters. We expect to see less Medicaid rate pressure in the second half of 2012 as we anniversary the Florida rate cut in July of 2011.  Managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.4% on a same facility basis in the quarter, which is slightly better than the 4.1% we reported in the first quarter of this year. Managed care and other same facility case mix increased 0.5% compared to the prior year second quarter. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased by 243 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year, and during the second quarter same facility charity care discounts totaled 706 million, an increase of 52 million from the prior year while same facility uninsured discounts totaled 1.526 billion, an increase of 191 million from the prior year.  Once again, we were extremely pleased with expense management in the quarter as same facility operating expense per equivalent admission – and this again would exclude the equity and earnings of affiliates and electronic health records incentive income – increased only 0.1% compared to the prior year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter where operating expense per equivalent admission is essentially flat with the prior year period. Salaries per equivalent admission increased 0.8% compared to the prior year on a same facility basis. The same facility productivity performance improved 1.6% compared to last year’s second quarter. Same facility wage growth was 1.3% in the second quarter. Also, personnel costs associated with physician employment increased by 14 million or 5.5% from the prior year’s second quarter, a significant reduction from recent run rates. Same facility supply costs per equivalent admission declined 2.2% from the prior year, reflecting minimal supply cost inflation and the Company’s supply cost reduction initiatives. Same facility other operating costs per equivalent admission increased 0.7% from the prior year. The Company recognized 70 million in electronic health record incentive income in the second quarter, consistent with our expectations. The Company also incurred approximately 19 million in EHR-related expense in the second quarter compared to 24 million in the second quarter of 2011. Our monitoring mechanisms continue to report that we are achieving Stage 1 Year 2 meaningful use, and we expect to certify such at most of our hospitals during the fourth quarter of this year. Interest expense declined 72 million from 520 million for the second quarter of 2011 to 448 million for the second quarter of 2012. This reduction in interest expense reflects the benefits of debt refinancing transactions we completed during 2011 and has a positive impact on our cash flows. Cash flows from operating activities in the second quarter increased to 1.46 billion compared to 748 million last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of 165 million and an increase in favorable changes to operating assets and liabilities in the quarter of 525 million, including our receipt of approximately 270 million in payments on the rural floor Medicare receivable that was recorded in the first quarter of 2012. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, our free cash flow after CAPEX and distributions to non-controlling interests totaled 1.282 billion.  Capital spend in the second quarter totaled 449 million compared to 447 million last year. This is consistent with our expectations and guidance for the full year. Days in accounts receivable at June 30, 2012 were 50 days, a decline of three days from March 2012 and unchanged from June 30, 2011. Days in AR declined partially due to the receipt of the aforementioned rural floor Medicare settlement. At June 30, 2012, the Company’s debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.2 times compared to 4.43 times at March 30, 2012 and 4.46 times at December 31, 2011. At the end of July, we had approximately 3.475 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities. And finally, as you saw in the release this morning, we reaffirmed our guidance for 2012. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning. I’ll begin my comments this morning with more detail on our volume trends for the quarter and then wrap up with a review of our market share data for year ending 2011. The performance across the Company’s 15 divisions was very balanced again this quarter, indicating broad-based execution of the Company’s growth strategy. Ten out of 15 divisions had growth in same facility inpatient admits on a year-over-year basis. Our Denver market, which is not included in same facility admits, had year-over-year growth in inpatient admissions also. All but two divisions had growth in same facility adjusted admits. All divisions had growth in emergency room visits again this quarter. Also, same facility managed care emergency room visits increased 6.1% for the quarter, reflecting improved outreach and greater access in this segment of the market. The emergency room continues to drive strong inpatient admits for the Company. Admissions through our emergency room were up 6.1%. EMS drop-offs to our emergency rooms were up 6.5%. We believe this growth in EMS volume is a function of program development such as trauma and stroke, plus more efficient turnaround capabilities for our ambulance partners.  Although surgical volumes were flat for the quarter, we continue to be encouraged by the results of our surgical growth plan. Seven divisions had growth in same facility surgical volumes for the quarter. Four of the divisions that had declines were only down by less than 1%. Orthopedic and neurosciences were the two areas that continued to show solid growth. Cardiovascular services and general surgery were essentially flat while women’s and urological services were down. Critical care admits in both our adult and neonatal units grew 4.7% in total; length of stay, however, was down by 3%. Now let me transition to 2011 year-end market share. As a reminder, market share data is not available for all HCA markets. We are able to get approximately 85% of the Company’s market share in a reasonable time period, usually 120 to 180 days after the fact, so I will be sharing some highlights from the most recent time period, which is the fourth quarter of 2011. First, the Company’s overall market share for 2011 improved by 35 basis points to almost 23%. We gained market share on a sequential basis in each of the four quarters, gaining an additional 11 basis points in the fourth quarter. The Company increased market share in 24 out of 37 markets. We had growth in market share in 12 out of 17 service lines that we studied. Market share in the commercial segment grew, and finally we saw growth in the end migration segment, reflecting progress with our rural outreach efforts.  Overall, demand for inpatient services in HCA markets grew in 2011 by 0.7%, which is a slight improvement over the rate of growth in 2010. Using this rate of growth as a proxy for the market growth in the first half of 2012 suggests that HCA is still gaining share with our year-to-date admission growth of 2.9%. And with that, I’ll turn the call back to Vic.
Victor Campbell: All right. Sam, thank you, Milton, Richard. Let me say this before I turn the call back to Jennifer. In the interest of time, I would like to ask that everyone keep their questions this morning focused on the quarter and our business overall rather than get into any speculation about the potential article that Richard discussed. I think between Richard’s comments and also the website posting which he mentioned, that’s all we really can and have to say about that matter this morning, and I appreciate your understanding. And I might just note that that website is hcahealthcare.com, and it’s on the home page; but we hope you listen to the Q&A here because I think we had an excellent quarter that you probably have some interest in. So with that, Jennifer, you want to poll for questions? Again, try to hold to one because I know we have a lot of people on today’s call.
Operator: Thank you. Today’s question and answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator instructions] And we’ll go first to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Thanks, good morning. 
Victor Campbell : Hi Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Hi. So the 8.8% ER increase was particularly strong, especially in a non-flu quarter. Maybe just remind us your initiatives there, and maybe have there been any closures of competing hospitals or EDs that can help explain some of that increase? And then just along those lines, bad debt was up a fair amount, so is that also a function of the increase in ED, and then just related to that, the use of ACEP that you talked about. I think that’s been in place for a while. Maybe just some context there. Thanks.
Sam Hazen: I’ll start with the—this is Sam. I’ll start with the emergency room growth. I think the emergency room growth that we are seeing is a function of a significant effort that the Company has made over many, many years to improve our emergency room operations, and that effort, I think, if I could categorically answer it would really come down to four or five major efforts. One is clearly improving our operations and how we take care of our patients when they enter the emergency room, and I think we’ve done an incredible job at dropping our time to see a patient from maybe 45 to 50 minutes to somewhere around 22 minutes on average across the company, and that’s clearly enhancing the service level and the satisfaction that we are seeing in the emergency room. The second thing that I would add that I think is having a tremendous impact is the fact that we’re adding a lot of program capability, and by program capability – I mentioned that in my comments earlier – we’ve added a number of trauma programs where it adds a level of sophistication to our emergency rooms, creates a better destination point for EMS services and so forth, and on top of that trauma development. We’ve developed sophisticated stroke capabilities in a number of our emergency rooms as well as cardiac capabilities, and I think, again, the combination of those program developments are adding volume as well. And then the third piece – and there’s one more after this one – that I would point to that I think is having a positive impact is capacity. I mean, we have clearly added capacity in our emergency rooms where we have had compression. We monitor our utilization per bed on a routine basis, and where we start to see capacity constraints we add capital either on our campus or in some cases off our campus in locations that need emergency capabilities. And then finally, marketing – I think we’ve marketed our emergency rooms in a way that showcases the performance and the capabilities, and the combination of those four things, I think are really driving the activity in our markets.  We have not seen any particular closures that have yielded market share gains or anything of that nature in the emergency services, so that’s really not a factor in what we’re seeing in our markets.
Victor Campbell: Milt, you want to do the bad debt question?
Milton Johnson:  Yeah, I’d be happy to. The primary reason for the increase in bad debt expense relates to increase in uninsured revenues, so we basically have reserved for that. The remaining bad debt increase is really related to co-pay and deductibles, and there we’re up about—bad debt is up about 10%, or roughly about $25 million, and that’s related to higher managed care volumes that we’ve reported. Sam mentioned the new trauma programs in the ED. Those trauma programs do result in some higher co-pays and so that’s contributing to a piece of that, and then just the normal plan increases that we’re seeing in co-pay and deductibles to our patients driving the remaining part. So it’s not any one thing, but it primarily is the uninsured revenue growth that’s driving bad debt.
Victor Campbell: All right. Ralph, thank you. I’m sorry – Sam?
Sam Hazen:  Yeah. And I wanted to add, Ralph, one thing to the discussion. I think, again, HCA’s portfolio of markets, when you look at the demographics and you look at the population trends and some of those dynamics that we’ve talked about in the past, it’s having an impact on emergency services demand within our markets as well. So that’s another component that I think is driving growth that maybe is different than what you’re seeing across the industry.
Victor Campbell :  All right, thank you.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank: Good morning everybody. Wanted to ask here a question about just volumes, and specifically as it relates to the growth you’ve seen in psychiatric and inpatient within the units in your hospitals. Thanks for giving us the growth of 14% from those units. Can you maybe just update us a little bit on the strategy there and also if you could help us just put into perspective the growth that you’re seeing in those services on the overall admission trend number? How much have we seen that contribute, say, over the year-to-date and this quarter specifically?
Victor Campbell: All right, thanks Darren. I think, Sam, you’re up again.
Sam Hazen: I couldn’t hear the first part, but I think you were asking, Darren, about behavioral health and rehab with the growth of 14%. Let me just give you some sense of what we saw as an opportunity, again, a few years back. In certain hospitals and within certain markets, we had idle capacity that we felt was not being used effectively, and in a number of those markets we did not have a full complement of services around rehabilitation capability as well as behavioral health capability. And so we saw two opportunities at a macro level with this initiative, one being, again, using idle capacity and then secondly adding network capability to really service our overall complement of hospitals in a particular market. And over the past number of years, we have invested a little heavier in behavioral health, and rehabilitation services is catching up as far as overall investment. I think at this particular point in time, we have north of 50 units in both services across the Company where we have capabilities, and we’ve seen growth in both of those fairly consistent this year around 15% year-to-date on psychiatric and behavioral health admissions, so the quarter is consistent with year-to-date growth. And then on the rehabilitation side, again, we’ve seen growth at 13% year-to-date, very comparable to the second quarter. The behavioral health capability has enhanced our ability, again, in the emergency room and that has freed up capacity for us to take care of emergent patients and then network and transfer behavioral health patients that access our emergency rooms and need behavioral health services. So it’s really played a big part in an overall comprehensive market strategy, and as we look forward we still have opportunities with capacity and we are investing in those in both services lines; and again, rehabilitation is not as far along in its progression as behavioral health is.
Victor Campbell: All right. Thanks, Darren.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank: That’s helpful. Thanks.
Operator: We’ll go next to AJ Rice with UBS.
AJ Rice – UBS: Hello everybody. Maybe I’ll just switch gears and ask you about the cash flow trends and use of cash going forward. You look like you’re now at a point where you’re probably running ahead of where you thought you would be year-to-date, and maybe that means that you’ll beat the cash flow guidance for the year. Maybe comment on that, and then also give us some flavor for use of cash flow going forward, I guess particularly in the context of all the refinancings that have already been done and where the debt levels are now. Does that give you flexibility to look at other uses for free cash flow?
Victor Campbell: All right, Milton, that one’s yours.
Milton Johnson: Sure. Yes, we’re certainly pleased with the cash flow performance for the first half of the year and it is ahead of our expectations. Of course, one reason would be the rural floor settlement of about $270 million that we didn’t have in our guidance at the beginning of the year, and that certainly is a piece of it; but overall, our cash flow has been very strong. Our cash flow guidance that we gave, I think was 3.4 to about 3.6 billion as we started the year, and I would say now that that’s probably closer to 3.8 to 4 billion cash flow from operations as we look at the rest of the year. We will see, I think, higher tax payments in the second half of the year that typically happens, so that, I think, will slow down the rate of free cash flow from operations compared to what we reported year halfway through the year. With respect to use of cash, we continue to look for acquisition opportunities. Our pipeline, as the other companies have mentioned as well, remains very strong. We see some good opportunities there. It’s too early to tell how all those will play out, but we think there will be good opportunities to invest our cash in some acquisitions. Following that, we’ll continue to repay debt as we have so far this year. As you noticed here at the second quarter, our debt levels on an absolute basis were basically flat with where we started the year. We have covered the leverage from the dividend that we paid in February of this year. So again—also for the second half of this year, I think our CAPEX run rate will be higher than the first half of the year. We still expect CAPEX to be somewhere around 1.8 to 1.9 billion, and so we’ll have a little bit of acceleration in the second half of the year to hit that target. Absent acquisitions and debt repayment, again from time to time as we have in the past, we would consider a special dividend opportunity depending on the market; and again, those decisions are made based on market conditions at the time that we’re reviewing those decisions.
AJ Rice – UBS: Okay, thanks a lot.
Victor Campbell: Thanks AJ.
Operator: We’ll go next to Kevin Campbell with Avondale Partners.
Kevin Campbell – Avondale Partners: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I did want to ask just one follow-up about the American College of Emergency Physicians. Was hoping maybe you could just give us some color on—remind us why you switched to that methodology a couple years back?
Victor Campbell: Yeah, we could barely hear you, but you were just asking why we did it. Okay, thinking going back, we changed to ACEP a number of years ago.
Sam Hazen: Yeah, in 2009 we made that change, and primarily we felt like it was a better system, a system that resulted in a higher level or higher quality coding result for our patient assignment under the emergency room evaluation and management guidelines. So it was done to improve, again, our assignment of those patients in the ER.
Richard Bracken: Yeah, and remember as we’ve described the ACEP or how this happens in emergency departments, there are different systems out there and what we had been using before was a point system, and what that meant is that people would look at the services provided in emergency services, apply certain points according to a scale, total those points up and establish the classification for the visits. What the ACEP system does, and to understand how that works, is it looks for proxies to establish levels of care, and so it’s a much more accurate system and efficient system to put in place, so that’s why we went to it.
Victor Campbell: Thanks for your question and welcome to the call.
Kevin Campbell – Avondale Partners: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning. Good quarter. Just a question in light of the changes in the assumptions surrounding HCIT – I’m just curious, are you kind of maintaining some conservatism by not raising your estimates, and maybe you can give us an update on how you see Florida and Texas playing out. Thanks.
Victor Campbell: Milton, you want--?
Milton Johnson: Yeah. Well, no we did not raise our guidance. We are halfway through the year, and if you look at although we—our performance has been very solid relative to our guidance. If you look at the pieces of it, volume’s been better, about 1% better than we had projected in our guidance for the first half of the year, but our revenue rate is below what we had projected for the first half of the year by about 1% as well. We’ve made it up with better expense management of about almost 1.5% better than we thought on our expense management. So net-net, we’re doing well relative to our guidance. But at halfway through the year, again, our expectation is still within that range. We gave a $250 million range for EBITDA for this year and we feel like that is still the range that we would like to keep at this point in time of the year.
Victor Campbell: All right. One of you want to address Texas and Florida Medicaid? I think that was the second half of your question, Frank?
Frank Morgan – RBC Capital Markets: Yes.
Victor Campbell: Okay. 
Sam Hazen: Well, in Texas—let me start there. The anniversary date of the cuts that we’ve experienced this year, I think, is 9/30, so 10/1 we’ll anniversary last year’s budget cuts. The two outstanding items that we are yet to get final rules on are the disproportionate share funding requirements in Texas as well as the Texas waiver. Both of those components are yet to be finalized. We still are working with the State and others on that process, and so there’s uncertainty still around that particular resolution on those items. With respect to Florida, there are some remaining cuts that we will experience in the second half of this year, although they are less than what we experienced in the previous year. We anniversaried last year’s cuts on June 30, and then next year’s cuts are forecasted to be around 5%, and I think the annualized effect on those is about $25 million or something like that, that we’ve estimated at this particular point in time. So that’s sort of the status of those two states.
Victor Campbell: All right. Frank, thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Markets.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital Markets: Hi there. 
Victor Campbell: Good morning, Sheryl.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital Markets: It’s such a simple name! Okay. 
Victor Campbell: We know who you are!
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital Markets: Yeah, I’m hard to miss. Okay, well first of all, thank you for the very good explanation of the pricing. That’s very, very helpful. I’m going to not ask you about the investigation for the article by not asking you about it, but I’m going to ask you about something else that’s somewhat related because your stock is under pressure and it is of concern. So you all have had—our environment is now one that’s very focused on not only controlling revenues but also controlling waste and fraudulent spending in healthcare – that’s a blanket statement. So what are you all doing in your compliance programs to beef up what presumably is already a robust program, especially now that it seems that this focus is more on the physician decision-making capabilities and outcomes as well as related to, in quotes, quality of care issues as much as it is just billing. How are you managing through that, especially given how many physicians you employ as well as contract with or are related to or affiliated with in your markets? So an update on compliance, if you would.
Richard Bracken: Let me take a first shot at that. This is Richard speaking. Well first of all—and as you mentioned, we do have a robust compliance program in place and it’s been out there, as you know, since the late 90’s. And as you mentioned, we have extensive policies and procedures, training protocols, ethic lines, vehicles for people to raise questions in place. We follow it up with ambitious monitoring and reviewing and surveys, so all that’s been in place. We think it’s a very important and effective program. You bring up new issues that the industry is experiencing and how do we think about it. I would say fundamentally the first thing we’re thinking about is putting in physician leadership at various levels in our organization that have the job to sit on top of all the existing activities that are underway. Throughout the course of the last 12 months, we’ve put in addition to physician leadership that might exist in the hospitals, additional physician leadership at every one of our divisions who can sit on top and look at broad trends that might be occurring in a marketplace. We’ve added significant physician leadership in the management of our physician practices. We have moved our physician practices into a wholly-owned organization with significant physician leadership and councils to help sort out these questions. So we—and in addition to other issues, we bring in specialty councils to help us decide issues of care that we can move across the enterprise, and I think fundamentally and foundationally probably one of the most important things in addition to all of this is that we’re investing big time in the EHR. And of course, the EHR is out there to be more accurate but it also creates a database to mine issues, to understand how care is being provided not only efficiently but compliantly, and we have been on a quest to develop a system-wide EHR for years before the stimulus, the high tech program was put in. We think it’s foundational to the Company and we are continuing to execute that as fast and as efficiently as we possibly can. So I think it’s a combination of all these areas, not only the monitoring, not only the policies and procedures, but the leadership, the organization and the infrastructure to make it happen.
Victor Campbell: Sheryl, thank you.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital Markets: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, hello. I appreciate not wanting to talk about the New York Times investigation, but I’d really like to see if there’s any color we can get on the Florida investigation because there we have some disclosures that you could potentially respond to. I mean, the investigation into interventional cardiology services, is that just a continuation of what we saw at the end of last year as far as some of these RAC things? I guess the fact that you’re calling it interventional cardiology is something different than the ICD scrutiny. It implies things like stents and balloon angioplasty, so I was just wondering if there’s any detail that you can flesh out there.
Victor Campbell: Okay, Kevin. I’ll do that, and I guess if you have not—I mean, obviously we had disclosed in our 10-Q this morning that we did receive an inquiry from civil division in Miami U.S. Attorney’s Office, and it came in July so it is new. And it’s requested information on any reviews that were assessing the medical necessity of interventional cardiology services at any of our facilities. I think principally as we’re looking now, we’re trying to review to determine exactly which hospitals have had such reviews. At this point, we’re early in our analysis but we have identified about 10 facilities, a majority of those in Florida but there are, I think, two or three in some other states. So we’re gathering that. Again, we’ve just gotten the request, preliminary stages, and so really responding beyond that or trying to identify beyond what we’ve put in our disclosure would be premature at this point. So we’ve sort of given you everything we’ve got and can tell you at this point in time.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thanks.
Operator: We’ll go next to Gary Taylor with Citi.
Gary Taylor – Citi: Hey, good morning guys. The first is just a clarification, so I’m hoping it won’t count as a question. You had mentioned some new information on the website – were you saying that was already available, because I was just kind of perusing it and not seeing it. So maybe if you could direct us where that would be?
Victor Campbell: Yeah, I’m being told there is a blue bar across the top of the home website, and it’s on the home page. It was put on, I think as we started our call; so yes, it is new and should be there.
Gary Taylor – Citi: Maybe I just need to update then. Okay, we’ll look for that. I guess the question I wanted to ask for Milt—actually I refreshed and it’s there now, so you’re right – blue bar on the top of the home page. 
Victor Campbell: You are a techie! Way to go, Gary.
Gary Taylor – Citi: A question for Milt, just going back to the pressure that the Medicaid rate has had on your consolidated same store revenue per adjusted admission. I guess it looks like that’s contributed about at least 150 basis points of year-over-year pressure on that metric. Is there a range, I guess, you have in mind as we move into the back half of the year? I mean, should we see at least or approximately 100 basis points of that coming back in your favor in the back half? Is that about the magnitude of what you expect?
Milton Johnson: Well Gary, maybe let me help with it a little bit. First of all, the impact on our Medicaid rate has been more than we thought it would be, primarily in Florida. We had estimated that in the first half of this year, it would probably be about a $35 million impact. I’d say it’s probably close to double that impact on our rate in the first half of the year, so the second half of the year—you know, Sam just mentioned that we will see an additional cut in Florida starting July 1 of this year, but that cut will be, we think, substantially less.  So if you think about a negative run rate of, call it 60 to 70 million in the first half of this year on Florida Medicaid, in the second half of the year I’d say it would be more like maybe 15 million is what we’re thinking as far as drag. So we will get some relief on the Florida impact. With respect to Texas, the cuts we’re taking there are about 7 to 8 million a month on reductions in Texas Medicaid, and that anniversaries, I believe, at the end of September. And as of now, we don’t see any additional Texas cuts and don’t expect that. So again, in the fourth quarter, a little bit of help from Texas as well in the Medicaid rate. So that’s kind of how I see the second half of the year relative to those two states.
Gary Taylor – Citi: Okay, thanks Milt.
Victor Campbell: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: We’ll go next to Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo Securities.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo Securities: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like your tax rate was down a little bit sequentially. Milton, can you just maybe give us some guidance in terms of where you would expect it to be in the second half of the year, and maybe for the full year?
Milton Johnson: Yeah, it was down a little bit in this quarter. We did—we settled some disputes with the IRS and as a result, tax exempt interest expense, which is part of the tax rate, we had a reduction of 11 million in the quarter and that reduced the rate. The normalized rate, I would expect would be somewhere around 37 to 38%. I think it was about 35 or so in this quarter. So 37 to 38 sort of zone would be a normalized rate.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Victor Campbell: Thanks Gary.
Operator: We’ll go next to Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo – Robert W. Baird: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess really just a question for maybe Richard or Sam. We’ve recently seen sort of a number of deals in the physician area, medical group management, whatever you really want to call this sector. I’m just kind of curious on your perspective for what this trend may mean to you. You’ve obviously seen a lot of cycles with this in the past and have been pretty aggressive in a lot of your markets organizing docs in the last few years. So just kind of curious on your broader thoughts.
Richard Bracken: Well in terms of the sort of transactions for large physician groups that you mentioned, and the ones that I’m aware of were focused in areas where they have a concentration of physicians really were not in our markets. And so they really don’t apply to sort of our strategy. We look at physician integration on a range of fronts and local market by local market, so again, we think about how to integrate with physicians not only in sort of an employment model that you’re referencing through some of these acquisitions perhaps, but lots of other ways as well in terms of service and connectivity and ITS connectivity and the like. And so we’re careful about that. The price on the one transaction I think you’re referring to in southern California was very, very high, and that’s not really sort of our model. We look at physician integration market by market and we look at a range of options other than just full employment.
Sam Hazen: Yeah and Richard, if I could add, when we look at the active number of physicians at HCA’s medical staff this year compared to where it was at the end of last year, we have grown the number of physicians who have active privileges at HCA facilities by approximately 1,000 on a base of about 34,000, so pretty significant growth. Some of that has come through employment where we have added employment numbers to our base from last year and then clearly recruitment, and at the same time in supporting some of our service line strategies we’ve added physician capability either through recruitment locally or other methods to enhance the number of physicians that practice at our facilities. So from that standpoint, it really had to fit into the overall growth strategy within our markets, as Richard mentioned, and that’s sort of how we’re thinking about it. But I don’t see it as necessarily slowing down. We are getting better at making decisions on the front end, and we are getting much better at managing the practices on the back end, and the combination of that is allowing us to really execute this strategy more effectively than we were in previous years, we believe.
Whit Mayo – Robert W. Baird: Okay, thanks for the thoughts.
Victor Campbell: Thanks Whit.
Operator: We’ll go next to Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: Thanks, good morning. Just a follow-up on the Medicaid in Florida and then a question about managed care. You mentioned that the Medicaid hit in Florida was bigger than you thought it was going to be. Could you just give us a little bit of color how you got that wrong and why you sort of can identify the incremental cuts that are coming a little bit more accurately? And then on managed care, not only were you seeing on sort of absolute rates as you’re negotiating but are there any changes in terms of the terms, risk-taking, et cetera? Thanks.
Victor Campbell: All right. We’re pointing the finger at Mike Marks since he’s our CFO of that group.
Mike Marks: So one concept would be length of stay. In Florida with Medicaid, you’re paid a per diem. Our length of stay is down a couple of points, so that’s one reason why it was worse than we expected. The second thing, and I think has been described previously on other calls, is there’s movement between self-paying Medicaid to eligibility processes, and we’ve seen that movement hurt us in the first half of this year. That moves around as you go through timing between as self-pays come in, you try to get them converted to Medicaid through the eligibility processes. So between those movements and a little drop in length of stay would be the primary differences between what we expected and our actual results.
Milton Johnson: Yeah, it’s just not as simple as taking a prior year number and taking the haircut on it. It’s a pretty complicated, as Mike just described, calculation to try to estimate that, and some things moved on us that we didn’t expect – that’s the short story. With respect to managed care, I think your question was around we’re seeing any structural differences, and we’re not. We’ve got virtually all of our 2012 managed care revenue under contract, like 95, 96%. We’ve got 70% of next year’s managed care revenue under contract and about 40% of the following year; so again, as we typically have this time of the year, good visibility with respect to our managed care revenue and we continue to see rates similar to what we historically have been reporting in the 5 to 6% sort of zone, and at this time no real structural changes to those contracts.
Victor Campbell: Thanks, Tom.
Operator: We’ll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James.
John Ransom – Raymond James: Hi, good morning. With respect to the Florida and Texas Medicaid programs, I know that it’s not just about rate but they’re also trying to manage utilization. Have you seen any utilization changes as a result of that?
Sam Hazen: This is Sam. Not materially. There may be some adjustments on the fringes in those states as certain programs migrate to managed care, but our volumes in both of those states are way up. Now, some of that could be enrollees – I don’t have enrollee participation in each of those states, but we’re not seeing anything material at this particular point.
John Ransom – Raymond James: Okay, and thanks. As a follow-up, what are your latest thoughts on separate reporting and more disclosure on Parallon? Thanks.
Victor Campbell: Sure. Milton?
Milton Johnson: Yeah, this is Milton. We continue to analyze that at the end of each year as we think about the coming year, so our team will go through that process at the end of this year as we think about reporting for 2013. At this point in time, I think still from a materiality standpoint, we’re not there; but as we continue to see growth in Parallon, that can change. So it’s a process we review at the end of each year.
John Ransom – Raymond James: Okay, thanks a lot.
Victor Campbell: Thank you, John. Jennifer, I think we’ve got time for one last question.
Operator: We’ll go next to Vicki Bryan with Gimme Credit. 
Vicki Bryan – Gimme Credit: Along the lines of the previous question, can you tell us what percentage of the total admissions and equivalent admissions this quarter that you saw with the behavioral health and rehab? Can you break that out for us?
Victor Campbell: This quarter behavioral health and rehab, the percent of admissions? 
Sam Hazen: Yeah, the answer is one-third of our overall growth is related to those two services lines; and keep in mind that behavioral health and rehab represent approximately 7 or 8% of our total admissions approximately, and that was a pretty consistent metric for year-to-date as well.
Vicki Bryan – Gimme Credit: And that’s for equivalent admissions as well? 
Sam Hazen: Well, it’s more on the inpatient side. The outpatient activity in both of those service lines is not nearly as material as our acute service line. I don’t know that I have it on an adjusted admission basis, but I can have somebody get that back to you.
Vicki Bryan – Gimme Credit: Thank you.
Sam Hazen: You’re welcome.
Victor Campbell: All right. Vicki, thank you, and I want to thank everyone for your questions this morning and your patience. Mark and I are around all day. You all have a great day.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the HCA First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Vic Campbell: All right. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer, and I would like to welcome everyone on today’s call, including those of you who are listening to the webcast. With me this morning, as usual, are Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; President and CFO, Milton Johnson; Sam Hazen, President of Operations; and then we have many other members of the management team that are here with us or on the call to assist during the Q&A. Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today’s call contain any forward-looking statements, they’re based on management’s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of these factors are listed in today’s press release and in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the company’s future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. As you’ve heard, the call is being recorded. A replay of the call will be available later today. With that, let me turn the call over to Richard Bracken.
Richard Bracken: Thank you, Vic. Good morning to all, and we do appreciate your participation on our call this morning. Before I ask Milton and Sam to provide some operating details for the quarter, let me start by sharing a few brief and general observations. We are pleased to report that overall the results of our first quarter were generally in line with our expectations and provided a solid start for the year. Generally, we saw a continuation of the trends that we’ve been reporting on in recent quarters – favorable patient volumes, supported by efficient cost management, offsetting continued pressure on revenue per unit of service. For the quarter, and as reported, adjusted EBITDA was $1.823 billion, an increase of 14.6%. And adjusted EBITDA, excluding the net positive prior-year Medicare adjustments we announced on April 12th, was $1.652 billion, an increase of 3.9% compared to the prior year. Now, please keep in mind that our as-reported numbers do include the full ownership and consolidation of our Denver HealthONE market, as completed last November, and our Miami Mercy Hospital acquisition completed last April. Growth in patient volumes remained favorable for the quarter, even considering that all volume metrics were aided by the extra day in February due to Leap Year. Given this, reported admissions for the quarter were up 9%, and reported equivalent admissions increased 11.4%. On a same-facility basis, admissions and equivalent admissions grew 3.2% and 4.8, respectively. We now have experienced 18 quarters in a row of positive equivalent admissions growth. In addition, we also continued our favorable trends in emergency visits growth. As reported the emergency department growth was 10.5% for the first quarter or a 5.3% rate on a same facility basis. We also experienced growth in surgical volumes of 10.6% on a reported basis and 2.3% on the same facility basis. And as I’ve stated previously we believe our patients volume growth reflects not only strategic facility locations in areas with favorable growth dynamics, but also due to the success of our operating agenda that seek to improve accessibility of our services and the efficiency and effectiveness with which we service our patients through the system. We remain committed to the strategies as a way to not only improve efficiency but to improve the patient experience and clinical outcomes as well. Market share performance for the quarter remained positive and you will hear from Sam about some observations we have on market growth characteristics as well as recent share gains. We believe these gains reflect traction around our emergency department strategies, rural outreach efforts, patient transfer centers, physician integration, and quality performance agendas. On the pricing front, while Medicaid and Medicare pressures continued we saw some favorable results this quarter in our commercial book and Milton will provide some details on these metrics in just a minute. Once again, and as we have also reported recent quarters, our expense management has been effective. On a same facility basis our cost per equivalent admission for the past five quarters has been generally consistent. In essence we have managed volume adjusted cost inflation flat compared to prior year with three quarters. This reflects a very solid performance by our operating teams. In addition to operating costs we’ve also reduced our cost of debt capital, interest expense in the first quarter of 2012, is down $91 million compared to the same quarter of last year. And at quarter end our debt to adjusted EBITDA has improved to 4.43 times. Our quality performance initiatives continue with much success during the quarter, 9% of hospitals named to the Thomson Reuters 100 top hospitals for 2012 rates safe facilities, these results were based upon measures of clinical quality, efficiency and patient perception of care. These hospitals achieve lower 30-day readmission rates, shorter hospital stays and better survival rates, we are pleased with this recognition. And as I turn the call over to Milton I do want to draw your attention to our increased guidance for 2012 as provided in this morning’s earnings release. Our revised guidance reflects the net effect of the two Medicare adjustments as identified in the first quarter results. So with that let me turn this over to Milton.
Milton Johnson: Right. Thank you, Richard and good morning to all. I trust most of you have had a chance to review the company’s first quarter earnings release issued this morning. Our reported numbers require some explanation to understand the underlying trends and I will attempt to provide more clarity and be happy to take questions afterwards. Just to remind everyone HealthONE is not included in our same facility stats for the quarter. As Richard mentioned, the first quarter results once again provided for strong same facility volume growth and excellent same facility expense management. Same facility total case mix declined 0.5% in the prior year’s first quarter, which was generally consistent with the third and fourth quarter of 2011 which declined 0.5 and 0.4 from the prior year’s third and fourth-quarter respectively. Revenues in the first quarter increased 13.5% to 8.405 billion, primarily driven by the financial consolidation of our HealthONE venture, increased patient volumes, and the net effect of the two Medicare adjustments that we disclosed in our prerelease of April 12th. Same-facility revenue increased 5.1% in the first quarter compared to the prior year, and excluding the Medicare adjustments, it grew 2.7%. Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. in the first quarter totaled $540 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, compared to $240 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2011. Results for the first quarter of 2012 include the two previously announced Medicare adjustments, which had the net effect of increases of $188 million to revenues, $170 million to adjusted EBITDA, and $0.22 to earnings per diluted share. The Rural Floor Settlement will have no impact on future results, while the SSI ratio recalculation is estimated to reduce Medicare revenues by approximately $1 million per month in future periods. Results for the first quarter of 2011 include a charge of $181 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the termination of the private sponsors management agreement, which was terminated pursuant to its terms upon completion of the company’s IPO in March of 2011. During the first quarter, same-facility admissions increased 3.2%, while same-facility equivalent admissions increased 4.8%. Patient volume growth was primarily driven by medical admissions, which increased 4.5%, while surgical admissions increased 1.1% on a same-facility basis. Total admissions increased to 9% and equivalent admissions increased 11.4% during the quarter, primarily reflecting the HealthONE consolidation. Sam will provide additional insights into our volume growth in his comments. Volume growth from governmental payors continued to outpace growth from commercial payors. Same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.8% and 5.4%, respectively, in the quarter. Same-facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 12.1% on a same-facility basis and now represents 25.4% of our total Medicare admissions. Same-facility Medicaid admissions increased 4.1%, while same-facility equivalent admissions increased 4.7% in the first quarter compared to the prior-year period. Same-facility managed care and other admissions were flat with prior year, while same-facility managed care equivalent admissions increased 2.8% in the first quarter compared to the prior-year period. This is the third consecutive quarter that we have seen equivalent admission growth in our managed care book and the highest rate of growth in the last four years – in my view, an encouraging trend. The growth was fairly broad along all major service lines, with the exception of pulmonary and OB/GYN surgical discharges. Same-facility uninsured admissions increased 11.6% in the first quarter. The growth in same-facility uninsured admissions accounted for 60 basis points of the 3.2 total admissions growth during the first quarter. Same-facility uninsured admissions represented 7.1% of total admissions in the quarter compared to 6.5% in last year’s first quarter. Same-facility total surgeries increased 2.3% in the quarter, when compared to the prior year, reflecting an increase in inpatient surgeries of 1.5% and outpatient surgeries of 2.7% an improvement from past quarters. The increase in inpatient surgeries did not result in an overall increase in same facility total case mix due to the fact that the increases occurred in less complex surgical DRGs as compared to last year’s first quarter. Growth in our emergency room visits remain strong in the first quarter increasing 5.3% compared to the prior year on a same facility basis. As you might remember, we had an extremely strong first quarter in 2011 with same facility ER visits increasing 11.3%. Same facility revenue growth in the first quarter was driven by strong equivalent admission growth. Same facility revenue per equivalent admission excluding the Rural Floor Settlement, SSI adjustments, and the Texas Medicaid Waiver program declined 1.4% in the quarter. Various factors are influencing our revenue per equivalent admission, including higher growth of medical admissions in relation to surgical admissions, payor mix, and rate reductions in Florida and Texas Medicaid programs. The same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission excluding the impact of the Rural Floor Settlement and the Medicare SSI adjustments declined 1.8% from the prior year, same facility Medicare case mix declined on 1.2% in the quarter. Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission excluding Texas Medicaid Waiver program declined 10.2%, and that’s generally consistent with prior quarters. If you include the reductions in the Texas Medicaid Waiver program, Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission declined 13.4% compared to the prior year. Managed care and other facility revenue per equivalent admission growth improved from the most recent quarterly trends, increasing 4.1% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of last year. Managed-care same facility case mix index increased 0.6% compared to the prior year. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased by 412 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year, and during the first quarter same facility charity care discounts totaled 761 million, an increase of 129 million from the prior year while same facility uninsured discounts totaled 1.552 billion, an increase of 283 million from the prior year. We were extremely pleased with expense management in the first quarter. As same facility operating expense per equivalent admission, excluding the Texas Medicaid Waiver program, equity and earnings of affiliates, and high tech incentive income, increased 0.2% from the prior year period and as Richard mentioned, on the same facility basis our operating expense per equivalent admissions compared to prior year has been essentially flat for three consecutive quarters. Salaries per equivalent admission on a same facility basis increased 1.4% from the prior year, productivity performance improved 1.2% on the same facility basis compared to prior year, same facility wage growth was 1.8% for the quarter. Personnel costs associated with physician employment increased by 20.9% or $50 million from the first quarter of the prior year which is a reduction in rate of growth from the 2011 first quarter increase of 42.4% or $71 million compared to the first quarter of 2010. Same facility supply cost per equivalent admission declined 2% from the prior year, reflecting minimal supply cost inflation which the company has been able to mitigate by many of our supply cost reduction initiatives. Same-facility other operating expense per equivalent admission declined 1.4% in the quarter, reflecting several small reductions in various expenses. As noted in our income statement released this morning, the company recognized $55 million in electronic health record income in the first quarter, consistent with our expectations. The company also incurred approximately $18 million in HER-related expense in the first quarter compared to $20 million in the first quarter of 2011. Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter totaled $797 million compared to $918 million last year. The decline was primarily due to an increase of $233 million in adjusted EBITDA, being offset by a $135-million decline in net tax refunds, a $116-million increase in interest paid related to the timing of coupon interest payments on newly refinanced debt, and a $103-million net reduction from the net change in operating assets and liabilities. And this would include the increases in AR from the Medicare settlement and a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses. CapEx for the quarter was $335 million compared to $329 million last year. Acquisitions totaled $112 million in the quarter. This includes one hospital, Galichia Heart Hospital in Wichita, Kansas, and other smaller acquisitions. Days in accounts receivable at March 31, 2012 were 53 compared to 49 days at March 31, 2011. The AR associated with the Medicare settlement adjustments accounted for about one-day increase and the recent acquisitions added one day. At March 31, 2012, the company’s debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.3 times compared to 4.46 times at December 31, 2011 and compared to 4.62 times at December 31, 2011 pro forma for the February 2012 dividend of $955 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $2.75 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities. Now, turning to our revised 2012 guidance. The revised guidance included in today’s earnings release incorporates the net benefit of the previously discussed Medicare settlement adjustments. We have maintained our existing revenue range of $32 million to $33 billion, while increasing our adjusted EBITDA range by $170 million to $6.37 billion to $6.62 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share range by $0.22 to $3.50 to $3.77. We are also revising our 2012 guidance relative to EHR development expenses from $160 million to $160 million – from $140 million to 160 million range to a new range of $125 million to $150 million. Our guidance remains unchanged for EHR incentive income, which is a range of $325 million to $350 million. Let me turn the call over to Sam.
Samuel Hazen: Good morning. I’ll begin my comments this morning on our volume for the first quarter and wrap up with an update on market share for the third quarter 2011, which is the most recent data available. With respect to volume growth, the company had very good balance across our 15 divisions, again, this quarter and very good balance across our service lines. 13 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth in same-facility inpatient admissions. All domestic divisions had growth in same-facility adjusted admissions. 13 out of 14 domestic divisions had growth in same-facility emergency room visits. The emergency room continues to be an area of focus for the company, both strategically and operationally. We have numerous hospitals that have enhanced their service offerings with certified trauma programs, comprehensive stroke programs, including telemedicine and accredited chest paint program. Additionally, we have invested capital to increase our emergency room bed capacity and expand our geographic access to new patients. Last quarter, I reviewed our surgical growth initiative in detail. I am pleased to report that we had 12 out of 14 domestic divisions with same-facility total surgery growth for the quarter. We are still in the early stages of this effort, but we are encouraged by the results thus far. Within surgery, we continue to see solid growth in orthopedic and neurosurgery services. This quarter we also saw strong growth in general surgery volume. Within cardiovascular service line, we grew 1.7% in overall surgical activity with certain cardiovascular procedures rebounding. Open-heart surgeries were down by 1% in the quarter. And finally, within our ambulatory surgery division, same-facility case volumes grew by 3% in the quarter. Volumes in our intensive care units were up this quarter. ICU admissions on a same-facility basis were up 7.4% and same-facility admissions into our neonatal intensive care units were up 1.6%. Within these units we continue to see some length of stay declines, which can negatively affect our revenue per adjusted admissions for commercial business. As Milton mentioned in his comments, growth in medical admissions was strong in the first quarter. We also had strong growth in both behavioral services and rehab services. Admissions were up 17% and 10%, respectively, for the first quarter as compared to the prior year. Now let me wrap up my comments with an update on third-quarter market share data for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011. As a reminder, we typically have a 90 to 180-day delay in getting market share data to analyze. So this is the most current data available for 37 HCA markets and it represents approximately 90% of our hospitals. In general there are two positive takeaways. First, market demand appears to be increasing. And two, HCA market share is growing. Market demand for this period grew 1.2% as compared to only 0.4% in the same twelve-month period in the previous year. HCA’s market share for this period grew by 20 basis points to 23.1%. Within the various service lines, market demand grew across all categories except for women’s and cardiovascular service lines. In particular, medicine and behavioral service lines grew by 4.9% combined. HCA was up in nine service lines, flat in four service lines and down in only three service lines. Our growth plan continues to be focused on the following six areas. First, maintaining patients within our networks; two, expanding the markets that we serve; three is increasing the access to our facilities with capacity increases and new outreach sites; four developing high-quality service lines; five, solidifying physician engagement; and six, leveraging HCA scale. This plan is built on a foundation of quality outcomes, customer service and operational efficiency. We believe this growth plan is both producing gains in the marketplace today and positioning us to compete more effectively in the future for business. That concludes my comments, and I’ll turn the call back to Vic.
Vic Campbell: All right. With that, operator, would you solicit any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will now go first to Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Thanks, good morning.
Vic Campbell: Morning.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: I just wanted to reconcile the pricing statistic; I think you had said the same-store revenue, ex the settlements was up 2.7 compared to the kind of 4.8 on the adjusted admissions side, which means sort of pricing was down a little over 2. And I think in the prepared remarks you had said pricing was down 1.4, so I guess just to reconcile that. And maybe just if you could talk about the components of kind of the pure pricing acuity and payor mix along those lines? Thanks.
Vic Campbell: Milton, do you want to take that?
Milton Johnson: Sure. Yes, let me take a shot. There was a lot of parts and pieces to our revenue per unit because of the various impacts of Medicaid changes and the Texas Medicaid waiver program as well. So again, I think we – it’s 1.4% decline Ralph. And that 1.4% compared to last year excludes the two Medicare adjustments in the period and also excludes the impact of the Texas waiver program. If you include the impact of the Texas waiver program, the decline would be 2%. So I think that more closely reconciles to the overall revenue increase number which I gave you excluding the Medicare pickups, because that number did have the impact of the Texas waiver program.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then just in terms of the dynamics–?
Milton Johnson: Well, what we’re seeing is, of course, we’ve seen now Medicare was down 1.8% in terms of rate. We saw an acuity decrease there of 1.2%. So that again, we knew this would be a tough comp here in the first quarter. The case mix index for Medicare though continues to trend consistently going back, say, to the second quarter of 2011. So it was a difficult comp, and you saw that impacting our rate. But it’s not inconsistent where we have been in recent quarters. With respect to managed care, again, there the yield on our managed care book was 4.1% in the quarter. We saw a slight acuity increase of 0.6%. The 4.1% on a trend basis is the highest number we’ve had in the last two quarters. If you recall in 2011, we started out last year up 5.5%. We dropped to about 4.8% in the second quarter down to 3.8%. And then in the fourth quarter of last year, of course, we’re up only 1.3% in managed care. So a rebound now of 4.1% was a slight acuity increase. And then on Medicaid again, we were down over just – down over 10% there, again reflecting the reductions that we’re seeing in Medicaid reimbursements in Florida and Texas, primarily.
Vic Campbell: Good, Milt. Thanks. Thanks, Ralph.
Ralph Giacobbe – Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Adam Feinstein with Barclays.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays: All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Vic Campbell: Good morning.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays: I guess just – appreciate all of the details you guys gave us and just certainly the volume growth is just so much stronger than what the rest of the industry has been seeing. So, Sam, you made the comments with some of the data in terms of growing market share, as well as demand picking up in some of the markets. So just want to see if you could elaborate a little bit more, you know, which areas are you guys growing market share, and just trying to better understand in terms of what’s driving that. So I know it’s a tough question to answer, but just curious how long you guys are thinking about it.
Vic Campbell: All right. Sam is up to it.
Samuel Hazen: Well, I think we do have specific data through the third quarter. It doesn’t reconcile necessarily to the fourth quarter and the first quarter volume metrics that we published. We do believe that the growth in the marketplace is probably still there for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2012, but again, we need to see the market share data to verify that. But again, the marketplace for all of HCA’s markets grew as I indicated, and largely it was consistent across most of our markets. We do have some markets that grew in excess of that. Austin, Texas is a market that’s continued to have strong demand. And then we have markets like Las Vegas where we were down 2% during this time period. So, again, the portfolio of the company I think has positioned us to benefit from inherent demand growth. But when you look underneath the demand growth from a geographic standpoint and look at it from a service line standpoint, the business that we’ve been seeing, our medicine business, our behavioral business, and sort of that kind of activity has grown. For example, medicine grew 4.7%, HCA grew 7% on that service line. So we picked up 60 basis points of share on the medicine business. I think that’s partly due to our emergency room strategy where we continue to pick up share, we believe. And a lot of the activity that comes through the emergency room is medicine related. In surgery, our surgical growth initiative we believe is gaining some traction, and we’re benefiting from increased demand in orthopedics and neural sciences there, and we have picked up share in both of those service lines. If you look at women’s services, conversely, women’s services is down for two reasons. One, GYN surgery has generally migrated to outpatient because of technology. And so we’ve seen a drop in demand related to that. And then from an obstetrics standpoint, our delivery volumes have been down, and HCA is essentially flat in women services. So we’ve seen no growth in our market share on women’s services. And we have initiatives in place to try to deal with that. So that’s some color, Adam. I don’t know if that really answers your question completely. But it gives you some sense of it. And again, when you look across the geography, HCA, I think picked up share during this time in 22 or 23 markets, and we lost share in 14 markets. And so the combined share gain was 20 basis points, suggesting that in our larger markets we picked up enough share to compensate for those markets that were down.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays: All right. Thank you very much. That was very helpful.
Vic Campbell: All right. Thanks, Adam.
Operator: And next we move to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. Just wanted to ask a question here on the commercial pricing side of things. Could you just talk a little bit about the trends that you’re seeing, commercial rate increases and any discussions that you might be having on commercial narrow networks or ACO-type products? And actually any thoughts about actually taking risk going forward on the commercial side.
Milton Johnson: Well maybe just – I mean on the rate side, of course, I think I just went through that we had a rebound relative to recent couple of quarters’ performance with our managed-care rate. Still not yielding our contracted rate. Again, we would have expected it to be, say, around 5.5% and 4.1% this quarter. As far as visibility into our managed-care revenue, we’ve got about roughly 90% under contract for 2012, at that – call it 5% to 6% sort of increase. We’ve got about 60% of 2013 under contract and about 30% roughly of 2014. So, a lot of visibility into our managed-care revenue, and all that priced in that kind of 5% to 6% range contracted rate at this point. And I’m looking at Juan Vallarino. We’re not seeing, Juan, any sort of changes in structure right now of our contracts and the like. So – and really nothing material with respect to ACOs or any sort of tighter networks at this point in time in our managed-care book.
Juan Vallarino: That’s correct.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Well, the managed care companies seem to be talking a lot about that. Are you seeing your competitors do this, and you’re not participating because it’s too early, or how do you reconcile those two?
Juan Vallarino: No; I think there are conversations. I think that’s all they are right now, is just feeling each other out for a period of time. I think you have to let it run its course, but we’re having dialogue; it’s just not materializing into contracts yet.
Milton Johnson: And that was Juan Vallarino. I think, Juan, too, that would be based upon our markets that we’re in. And there could be other markets in the country where there could be more activity, but we’re not seeing that in our markets at this point.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thanks.
Richard Bracken: Thanks Kevin.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: Thank you very much for all the color. Obviously topline has been strong, but so was the cost side as you mentioned in some of your prepared remarks. Could you talk about maybe the sustainability of some of what we’re seeing on the cost side and going forward where the major opportunities might be to the extent anything can get even better?
Milton Johnson: Richard, do you want to lead with that?
Richard Bracken: Well, I think I sort of indicated in my remarks that we’ve been pretty successful in managing the cost side of our business over the last five quarters. And I guess in terms of thinking ahead and what’s still out there, I mean managing cost and reengineering how we provide healthcare services is absolutely a daily effort at the company. We – and I’ve stated in the past, we benefit – our cost structure to a certain extent benefits from the less intense service mix that we’ve reported, and the lesser surgery volumes; we get an automatic ride with that. But in terms of reengineering how we provide healthcare, our agenda is very complete. We see this as the next era of how appropriately cost can be taken out of the system, whether it’s in length of stay management, efficient care algorithms and the like. And actually the company has got a huge effort underway with our medical leadership designing those programs as we speak. To sit there and put a number on it right now would be premature. I think it’s fair to say that we believe this to be where the industry needs to be, certainly where we’re taking HCA, to provide highest value for the dollar spent. So, I think there’s a lot of opportunity going forward. We’ll continue in the traditional avenues of expense management. We’re not seeing wage rate pressure, given where the economy is. But in terms of reinventing healthcare, that’s really where our attention is at this point in time.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: On the supply side, how do you expect the medical device tax to ultimately play through on your side of the coin?
Richard Bracken: Medical device tax.
Milton Johnson: Sam, you?
Samuel Hazen: We’re not anticipating a pass-through to that effect. I mean we have contracts that are already established with our vendors through our HPG organization. And as those contracts get negotiated, I presume there will be discussion about that, but at this particular point in time, we’re not anticipating any kind of pass-through related to the medical device tax that’s embedded in the Affordable Care Act.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.
Milton Johnson: Thanks Tom.
Operator: And next we’ll hear from A.J. Rice with UBS.
AJ Rice – UBS: Hello, everybody. I guess maybe I’ll ask about the Parallon initiative and see if there’s an update on that. And specifically maybe comment – I know Accretive Health has been in the paper lately. Does that present any opportunities for you guys?
Richard Bracken: Milton, do you want to address that?
Milton Johnson: Sure, yes. Parallon development, A. J., we continue to see progress there. We have several discussions underway for supply chain as well as revenue cycle, and we will see over time how those work out, of course. We’re seeing also good traction in our workforce management section of Parallon as well. So we of course have new leadership in Parallon with Beverly’s retirement and with Michael O’Boyle coming in, and we are looking forward to seeing his contributions going forward as well. With respect to the accretive situation, A.J., I don’t know. I mean, it’s too early to tell where that’s going to play out as to whether that will present an opportunity or not.
Richard Bracken: Thanks, A.J.
AJ Rice – UBS: Thanks.
Operator: And next we’ll hear from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Borsch – Goldman Sachs: Yes, thanks, guys. If you look back and – at the current quarter, recognizing that you’ve done a lot from your own execution. Can you see a pattern here on commercial utilization that makes sense to you relative to the timing of the recession? Did you know, do you see that trough in 2010 that the managed care companies point to? And any sense that you have on the pickup in volumes that you are seeing to the extent – it’s not just a market share thing where it might be more insured, commercially insured patients versus patients feeling a little bit more ready to use healthcare services?
Richard Bracken: Sam, do you want that one? Thanks.
Samuel Hazen: Well, we are still studying our third-quarter market share data, and we do have within certain markets very good and accurate payer mix data within our market share metrics. And in those markets we have seen, if you look at sort of the sequential quarterly performance of those markets, not HCA performance, just the overall market, a reduction in the rate of decline related to commercial admission activity. It hasn’t necessarily rebounded to where there is growth in the metrics yet, that could be in place in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Again we don’t have that data. But in some of the markets where we do have good commercial payer activity, we’ve seen a slowdown in the rate of decline, it’s still not positive. Within our own metrics, we are seeing more commercial activity in our emergency services. Milton mentioned that we actually had probably the best metric on commercial admission activity this past quarter. I do sense that we are picking up some market share, but it could be that there is some lift in the marketplace as well with respect to overall commercial demand. And so as we move through ‘11 and we did see better metrics on that front versus 2010. And we are hopeful, as I indicated on the last call, that we are going to continue to see those trends progress into 2012.
Richard Bracken: Thanks, Matt.
Matthew Borsch – Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital Group.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital Group: Good morning, everyone. Oh, there’s so many questions to pick from. Okay.
Vic Campbell: Be kind.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital Group: Yes, okay. I’m going to ask you this one. HealthONE clearly helped on the volume side. And – but you know as I look at the EBITDA on – excluding the high tech and excluding the Medicare settlement dollars, you’re to be commended given all the headwinds on pricing that this is flat. But I guess I’ll ask the question, and is HealthONE as accretive as you and we hoped it would be, and the base business is just that much deteriorated because of the pricing? Or am I looking at this wrong? And is that linked to the performance and cash flow this quarter at all?
Vic Campbell: All right. Good question. Milt, do you want that one?
Milton Johnson: Sure. Yes, I mean, first of all, HealthONE is performing as we expected, actually, I think slightly better than we expected. And so when you look at the base business, as we say, we are being negatively impacted by the revenue changes, the reimbursement changes in Medicaid. And Sheryl, I know you recall these, but just – we are going through roughly about a $13 million per month reduction in Medicare reimbursement when you combine the impact – monthly impact of Texas and Florida. And then in addition to that in this quarter there was a $40 million reduction in revenue from the Texas Medicaid program. Now we had about a $10 million reduction in related expenses, so about a $30 million negative impact in the quarter. So you do the math on that and that’s a lot of headwinds hitting EBITDA here in the first quarter relative to just governmental reimbursement changes. And so despite that, as your analysis just went through, we’re basically flat on an EBITDA basis including HealthONE. So – and with respect to cash flow, clearly, the cash flow being down was related to less tax refunds for the first quarter versus a year ago. And then the other piece was interest payments. And its where we – with some of our refinanced debt, we changed the coupon payment dates. And so now we have more interest being due in the first quarter in 2012 than we had coupons being due in 2011. As Richard mentioned in his notes the actual interest expense on the accounting side on an accrual basis declined $91 million year-over-year. So this is strictly a timing of payments impacting our cash flow. And we should see that normalized out later in the year of course as we pick up the favorable impact of the timing on interest payments.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital Group: Okay, great. Thank you.
Vic Campbell: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Gary Taylor with Citi.
Gary Taylor – Citi: Hi. Good morning, everybody. One clarification and one question, so I’m going to hope the clarification doesn’t count as my question.
Vic Campbell: It depends on what it is.
Gary Taylor – Citi: The clarification is, I don’t know – I guess I wasn’t paying close attention early on, Milt, but on the net revenue per – the same-store net revenue per adjusted admission figure, were you saying that the Medicare settlement was in there and really that plus 0.3 was a minus 2? Is that what Ralph was clarifying? I got confused there.
Milton Johnson: No. I think the number I gave was we were down 1.4%, and that excludes the two special Medicare adjustments we had during the first quarter. It excludes the impact of the Texas Medicaid waiver program impact.
Gary Taylor – Citi: So I’m sorry, so 0.3 you’re showing includes – that includes the Medicare settlement?
Milton Johnson: Yes. That includes the Medicare settlement; that’s correct.
Gary Taylor – Citi: So the same-store revenue growth is 3.4% in the quarter, is that right, if you exclude the Medicare settlement?
Milton Johnson: No. I think how we get there – you think about same-store, we had volume growth of, I think, it was 4.8% adjusted admissions. Then if you factor in on the same facility basis, take out the two Medicare settlements, the Texas waiver, and I’m sorry, leave the Texas waiver program in, we get about the 2% reduction in net revenue per adjusted admissions same-store, which would net out to roughly 2.7%, 2.8% same facility top-line revenue growth.
Gary Taylor – Citi: Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. Okay. That’s still better than we thought given how much tougher the comp got. And now of course, I’ve completely forgotten what my question was. Texas, the additional pending changes to UPL and DSH, did I miss an early comment on that as well, just kind what you guys are thinking? Obviously you must think plausible outcomes are within your range of guidance, but is there anything else that you said about it?
Samuel Hazen: We didn’t say anything else about it in the discussion, Gary. But Texas just recently published some proposed rules around disproportionate share payments in the state. That has initiated the rule making process. We are actively engaged in the rule making process, and think there will be some adjustments to what is proposed. And at this particular point in time we really don’t have any specificity around that. But we are actively engaged on that. As it relates to UPL program, there are still developments and discussions related to the two components of the waiver program. Those won’t be resolved probably until late this year. And so we really don’t have anything else to guide you on as it relates to that program either.
Vic Campbell: Thanks, Gary.
Gary Taylor – Citi: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Next we will hear from Deepak Raja with Broad Arch Capital.
Deepak Raja – Broad Arch Capital: Thanks. First, thank you for the dividend, and I wanted to know when I’m going to get the next one. But my real question is 2013, I guess we’re all talking about Medicare cuts, and I don’t know what’s going to happen in Washington, but can you kind of guide me a little bit as to how much of a cut you can take on the Medicare side and still maintain your growth profile?
Vic Campbell: Let me – this is Vic, and let me just address what has been proposed. The IPPS rule and I think everyone saw it come out a week ago, and it was a positive adjustment. However, once you put the 2% sequester against it, you’re looking at something that’s flat to down for most folks, including us. So we are disappointed with the proposed rule, in particular the coding and outlier adjustments. And we will be working with Federation, AHA and all hospitals to provide appropriate comments and indicate why those cuts should not be there. And as some have pointed out, many of you on the call, that history shows that the final rule often differs from the proposed rule. We hope that’s the case again this year but time will tell, but we will be working on that. But net-net, if you look at what has been proposed, we have an increase in the fourth quarter of something between 1% and 2%, before the sequester; then the sequester, if it kicks in early next year, obviously, it takes that away and you’re looking at something less. So, but again, it’s early on. I don’t know, Milt, if you want to address anything further than that, but that’s what we – in fact, thank you. And thank you for the comment on the dividend.
Deepak Raja – Broad Arch Capital: I’m waiting for the next one, so I am here.
Operator: Next we will go to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank: Thanks. So my question is really around M&A and acquisition environment. You’ve stuck to your knitting for the most part with M&A doing a lot of tuck-in in market type deals and things that you’ve operated in the past, like in Denver. I guess the real quest question here is what are you seeing out there, do you think geographically we’ll see any change in the strategy, and given the fact that after having just paid that dividend to your shareholder, like, your leverage is basically flat sequentially. Does that suggest that at this leverage level you might be comfortable doing a little bit more M&A?
Vic Campbell: Richard?
Richard Bracken: Yeah. Well, first of all, relative to acquisition strategy, and our strategy to some extent is independent of geography. When we talk about acquisitions, we – our primary filter of course is as you mentioned, existing markets, some things that are supportive and additive in existing markets. But we obviously look at new markets if we can create a substantial presence or see a way to create a substantial presence over time, and on that filter we’re open. We did it in Kansas City where we had nothing; that was the last big one. But as we think this market continues to consolidate with the revenue pressures that are out there, there might well be new geographies that are presented to us and our strategy will be the same. Can we, for a fair price, buy assets, typically troubled? Do we have a view where we can be a major market share player in that? In that, can we bring our shared service agenda to create value? And if we can do that in a disciplined way, we will execute. And I think it’s a fair question that you asked. We’ve asked ourselves that question. Do we have to commit ourselves to very, very large urban markets? Well, that’s where we’re at; that’s our core business. But I think we look at everything in this period of change, and we apply the strategy across all opportunity.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank: And is the environment changing for you, just as you think about the pipeline of deals that you have right this moment?
Richard Bracken: Is the environment – I’m sorry, I miss the question.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank: Is your pipeline much different today than, say, it was a year or so ago? Maybe just help us think about the M&A piece over the next 12, 24 months.
Richard Bracken: Well, I definitely think – I’m not exactly sure what you define as a pipeline. There is certainly the inbounds. The opportunities in the marketplace are much greater than they have been in recent times, and we are processing all those. I would be quick to point out, though, that we are disciplined buyers. And just because something is for sale doesn’t mean that we’re necessarily going to jump all over it. We have a formula, we feel it important in this time with a certain amount of revenue uncertainty to stick to that formula, and it served us well. I think our track record speaks for itself. We do see acquisition opportunities increasing, as we have said. It’s certainly different now than it was even three years ago. We have actually added resources to our M&A function as you know, and so we’re being very thoughtful about how to be productive in this new environment.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank: That’s helpful.
Vic Campbell: All Right. Thank you, Darren. Probably time for just one more question.
Operator: With that, our final question then will come from Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.
Whit Mayo – Robert Baird: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for slipping me in. I guess I just had a general question around the IT strategy and high tech, and Milton, I’m just sort of curious where you guys are relative to your IT work plan at this point, and maybe how that’s met up with expectations. And if you could comment on cost and just any general commentary for how we should think about the next step, when you guys are thinking about stage two.
Milton Johnson: Sure. Well, let me just say first of all that our IT strategy is primarily around the clinical agenda as you can imagine. Currently, we are about six months into a development of the clinical data warehouse. We’re also working on the health information exchange. And of course as we’ve discussed before, we have a couple of pilots going on; one with Meditech 6.0 version, and another pilot with Epic. And so we need to see the outcome of those pilots, but – and then make some decisions about how we go forward with a new clinical system. That will be a multi-year sort of implementation. We don’t have all the cost estimates on that yet. That is what the pilots will help us inform us as to how we should think about cost and again how we should formulate implementation plans. So we’re a little too early to talk about that. But certainly our IT agenda is very full right now, and it is going well. And again, it’s primarily around the clinical agenda.
Vic Campbell: All right. Whit, I thank – you very much. I thank everyone. Mark and I are both here, happy to take your calls. You all have a great day.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s call. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the HCA Fourth Quarter and Year End 2011 Earnings Release Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President, Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead, sir.
Vic Campbell: Lila, thank you and good morning to everyone on today’s call and to those of you who are listening on the webcast. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer and I’m pleased to host you here this morning. With us, our Chairman and CEO, Richard Bracken; our President and CFO, Milton Johnson; and Sam Hazen, President of Operation. We also have several other members of the HCA senior management team here this morning to assist during the Q&A. Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today’s call contain any forward-looking statements, they’re based on management’s current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today, many of the factors are listed in today’s press release and in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the company’s future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. And as you heard the call is being recorded, a replay will be available later today. With that, let me turn the call over to Richard Bracken.
Richard Bracken: Okay. Thank you, Vic, and good morning to all. We do appreciate your participation on our call this morning. We have a lot to cover today so let me get to it. I’ll start by providing some overall observations for the year, and then Milton and Sam will follow with detailed review of the fourth quarter’s financial and operating results. Milton will then close this morning with our 2012 guidance and some of the key assumptions in that guidance. Let me begin by saying that we are generally pleased with how our operating teams navigated through some pretty significant challenges the hospital industry faced in 2011. We ended the year not expecting to see significant improvement in unemployment rates and other key economic indicators, and also knowing that hospitals would not receive a Medicare payment rate increase for at least three quarters of the year. In addition, we expect that the Medicaid payment pressures in certain states but as you now know we ended up with a greater than anticipated Medicaid rate cuts in both Florida and Texas in the second half of the year and as we have discussed at length in our call beginning with the second quarter of 2011, we have experienced a service mix shift from surgical to medical admissions. Despite these significant challenges we produce revenue growth of nearly 6% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 3.3%. During 2011 we made significant investments in technology and our clinical quality and patient service agendas, and our market based service line strategies, and we’re confident these investments will continue to serve us very well in the future. We’re particularly pleased with the successful efforts of our operating teams to adjust their offering operating cost in the second half of the year to offset the greater than anticipated revenue per admission pressures. In our third quarter, our same facility operating expense per equivalent admission was flat and in the fourth quarter we actually saw four-tenth percent decline in our same facility operating expense per equivalent admissions. For the full year, our operating expense per equivalent admission rose only 1.4% reflecting strong management of both overhead and variable expenses, while still supporting important growth initiatives. As we’ve discussed before part of our ability to manage operating costs effectively as result of our continued strong volume growth. This proved true throughout each quarter of 2011. For the full year, our admissions grew 4.2% equivalent admissions were up 5.2% and emergency room visits were up 7.7%. On a same facility basis admissions grew 2.3% equivalent admissions 3% and ER visits up 6.2%. We now have experienced 17 straight quarters of same facility equivalent admission growth, and Milton and Sam will provide some more color on our volume growth in a few minutes, but let me just say that we believe this growth not only confirms our favorable facility locations in areas with good population growth dynamics but also reflects an operating agenda that seeks greater efficiency and effectiveness in how we process patients through our hospital, equally important in this strategy is our commitment to improve clinical outcomes and enhance the overall patient experience. As you might’ve noticed in our release this morning, our cash flows from operating activities totaled $3.9 billion in 2011. These funds along with the proceeds from our March IPO of approximately $2.5 billion gave us significant financial flexibility in 2011. During 2011, we made capital investments of approximately $1.7 billion in our existing facilities and markets. We invested $1.45 billion to acquire full ownership of our HealthONE partnership in Denver and on prior calls we’ve talked at length about the benefits we foresee in this market in the coming years. You’ll also recall that in September this past year we successfully repurchased more than 80 million shares of our common stock which was owned by Bank of America representing approximately 16% of our outstanding shares. We paid approximately $1.5 billion to purchase these shares at $18.61 a share, obviously an accretive transaction for our shareholders. In addition, we were able to refinance and extend a significant amount of our LBO debt during 2001 at favorable rates and as a result, our near-term debt maturities had been substantially reduced and we will realize meaningful interest savings. We have consistently said since returning to the public market that we plan to be flexible in determining the best usages of our cash flow, even with these substantial investments I just mentioned, we lowered our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio from a little over 4.8 times at the end of 2010 to just under 4.5 times at the end of 2011. As stated in our release this morning, our Board has approved a special cash dividend of $2 per share of common stock providing liquidity to our shareholders. This payout should not affect our ability to invest in our markets or impair our acquisition strategy. It’s important to note that the impact on our leverage from this dividend will be modest. A discussion of HCA highlights for 2011 would be incomplete without recognizing the 76 HCA hospitals named among the 405 U.S. hospitals identified by the joint commission for accreditation of hospital organizations as top performers on key quality measures. You may recall in September that the Joint Commission recognized these hospitals for evidence based care processes, closely linked to positive patient outcomes, we’re proud that 20% of those hospitals recognized are HCA facilities. And finally, I want to commend our operating quality performance and IT&S teams who are responsible for the very successful rollout of our EHR in 2011, allowing virtually all HCA hospitals to meet Stage 1 Meaningful Use requirements during the first year. We are pleased to be among the leaders in what we believe is an important foundational step in our ability to create a clinical data set to assist in the provision of more cost efficient and effective healthcare services. And finally on February 1st we closed on an acquisition of an 82-bed hospital in Wichita, Kansas, that complements our 760-bed Wesley Medical Center and we are pleased to welcome them to our organization. So, with that, let turn the call over to Milton.
Milton Johnson: Thank you, Richard, and good morning to all. I hope each of you have had the opportunity to review the company’s fourth quarter earnings release issued this morning. We have a lot of moving parts in this quarter, while attempt to clarify major issues, as well as provide more insight into our 2012 earnings guidance provided in today’s earnings release.  As Richard mentioned, the fourth quarter results provided strong volume growth and excellent expense management. We did, however, continue to experience an unfavorable shift in service mix compared to the prior year, along with Medicaid reductions in a couple of states, which resulted in lower revenue per equivalent admission growth. Before I begin to get into the details, let me point out that this is the first quarter that our HealthONE joint venture is now fully consolidated in our financial and operating stats. It is not included in same facility financials or operating metrics. We are accounted for investment in HealthONE using the equity method through October of 2011. With our share of the operations all recorded in the line item equity and earnings of affiliates in our consolidated income statement. Our share of HealthONE’s earnings represented approximately 90% of the total equity in earnings of affiliates in our consolidated income statements for each of the last three years. We began consolidating HealthONE’s operations in our consolidated income statement beginning November 2011 and the equity earnings of affiliate line item has been and is expected to continued to be significantly reduced compared to periods prior to November 2011. Revenues in the fourth quarter increased 8.5% to $7.769 billion, primarily driven by increased patient volume and the consolidation of the HealthONE joint venture. Same facility revenues increased 2.2%. Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. in the fourth quarter totaled $1.935 billion or $4.25 per diluted share. This includes a pretax gain on acquisition of controlling interest in our equity investment in HealthONE of $1.522 billion or $3.13 per diluted share, reflecting the remeasurement to estimated fair value of our investment in HealthONE following our acquisition of remaining 40% ownership from the Colorado Health Foundation. Also, in the fourth quarter results include a pretax on sales and facilities of $145 million or $0.18 per diluted share, primarily reflecting the sale of our Palmyra Medical Center in the quarter. Tax rate in the quarter was favorably impacted due to the majority of the HealthONE gain being a non-taxable item. During the fourth quarter, same facility admissions increased 2.5% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.2% each compared to the prior year fourth quarter. As noted in this morning’s release, excluding international facilities, patient volume growth in the quarter was primarily driven by medical admissions which increased 4.8%, while surgical admissions declined at 1.8% on a same facility basis. This is fairly consistent with the prior two quarters. We continue to see our patient volume growth resulting primarily from governmental payers. However, we have seen some improving trends in our commercial payer volume. Same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 4.2% and 4.8% respectively in the quarter. Same facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 8.1% on a on a same facility basis and represents 24.2% of our total Medicare admission. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 3.1% and same facility equivalent admissions increased 4.3% in the quarter compared to the prior year. During the fourth quarter same facility managed care and other admissions decline 0.7%. However, same facility equivalent admissions increased 0.8% compared to the prior year. This is the second consecutive quarter that we have experienced growth in managed care equivalent admissions. Same facility total surgeries declined 1.8% compared to the prior year, reflecting a decline in inpatient surgeries of 2.1% and outpatient surgeries of 1.6%. Same facility uninsured admissions increased 5.2% or 1,399 admits in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility uninsured admissions represents 7.2% of total admits in the quarter, compared to 7% in the prior year’s fourth quarter. We continue to experience strong growth in the company’s ER visits, a major driver of hospital inpatient volume. During the fourth quarter the same facility ER visits increased 4.4% compared to the prior year. Same facility revenue growth in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by solid equivalent admissions growth. The continued shift in our medical mix during the quarter is reflected in the same facility revenue per equivalent admission decline of 1% during the fourth quarter. Our same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admissions increased 0.7% in the quarter. Same facility Medicare case mix index decreased 1% from last year’s fourth quarter. However, it increased sequentially 0.5% from the third quarter of 2011. Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission excluding UPL declined by 10.4%, primarily reflecting reimbursement reductions in Taxes and Florida. Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission including UPL reductions declined 14.2% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission growth was below recent trend, increasing 1.3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting an unfavorable shift in service mix. Managed care and other case mix index for the quarter declined 0.7%. We experienced year-over-year declines in neonatal patient volumes, as well as cardiovascular surgery and spine surgery. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased by $269 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. During the fourth quarter, same facility charity care discounts totaled $680 million, an increase of $76 million from prior year, while same facility uninsured discounts totaled $1.348 billion, an increase of $193 million in the prior year. We were very pleased with expense management in the fourth quarter, as same facility operating expense per equivalent admission declined 0.4% compared to the prior year. On a reported basis, operating expense per equivalent admission increased 0.6%. Salaries per equivalent admission on a same facility basis increased 0.7% in the quarter when compared to the prior year. Hospital-only productivity performance as measured by man hours per equivalent admission improved 3%, while the company improved 2.2% on a same facility basis compared to the prior year. Wage rate growth was 1.8% for the fourth quarter on a same facility basis. Same facility personnel cost associated with our physician employment company increased $39 million to $249 million compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Same facility supply cost per equivalent admission declined 4.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a decline in surgical volumes and continued effective execution of our supply chain initiative. Same facility other operating expense increased 0.9% in the fourth quarter consistent with prior quarters. The company recognized $120 million of EHR incentive income related to the Meaningful Use of certified EHR technology and approximately $19 million of EHR-related expenses in the fourth quarter. In response to new accounting guidance, the company revised its accounting recognition of income from EHR incentive payments. EHR incentive income is not included in revenues but is presented as a separate line item in our consolidated income statement. For the year, EHR incentive income totaled $210 million and we incurred $77 million of EHR-related expenses. During 2011, the company received $306 million in EHR incentive cash payments. For the fourth quarter, cash flows from operating activities increased to $1.387 billion from $534 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting improvements in working capital items of $388 million and $467 million related to income tax. CapEx for the fourth quarter increased to $509 million from $465 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, $14 million of the increase reflects the consolidation of the HealthONE joint venture. Based on account receivable, December 31, 2011 were 53 days compared to 50 days at the end of the third quarter and 49 days at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the company’s debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.46 times, compared to 4.81 times at December 31, 2010. At the end of the quarter, we had $2.137 billion of borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facilities. We will use available cash and the company’s credit facilities to fund this morning’s announcement of a special dividend of $2 per share or approximately $952 million. Our leverage ratio pro forma for the dividend as of 12/31/11 4.63 times. Now before going to Sam, let me go ahead and cover our 2012 guidance. We estimate that for 2012, consolidated revenues for HCA should range from $32 billion to $33 billion. Included in our estimate is $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in revenue from HealthONE. Our estimate does not include any additional revenues from acquisitions that may be completed in 2012. Adjusted EBITDA, we estimate a range from $6.2 billion to $6.45 billion for the year, while earnings per diluted share we estimate a range from $3.35 to $3.55 for 2012. On a same facility basis, we expect overall volume growth at a slightly lower rate than 2011. HealthONE will be included in our consolidated volume stats, but will not be included in same facility stats. On a consolidated basis, we expect equivalent admission growth to range from 7% to 8% for the year. On a same facility basis, we expect equivalent admission growth to range from 2% to 3% for the year. With respect to net revenue per equivalent admission growth, we expect to continue to see unfavorable rate impact from changes and service mix during the first quarter of 2012. But we expect less rate impact from service mix changes for the remaining three quarters of 2012. On a consolidated basis excluding UPL, we expect net revenue per equivalent admission growth in the range of 3% to 3.5% for 2012. On a same facility basis excluding UPL, we expect net revenue per equivalent admission growth in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Our guidance assumes an expense growth outlook that will continue to benefit from our low inflationary environment. We will continue to invest in our clinical and EHR development strategy. Our total expense growth is modeled based upon our expected revenue growth for 2012. Our guidance includes estimated EHR incentive income in a range of $325 million to $350 million and EHR-related expenses in a range of $140 million to $160 million. Also, capital expenditures for 2012 should range from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, with the increase primarily reflecting for change and recognition of HealthONE-related capital expenditures. So, with that, I’ll pause and turn the call over to Sam.
Sam Hazen: Good morning. I’m going to focus my comments on more details related to the volumes statistic this quarter. I’ll begin with a look inside our portfolio to give you some perspective on the performance across the market. Once again, the company had very good balance across our 16 divisions with respect to volume growth for the quarter as compared to the previous year. All 15 domestic divisions had year-over-year same facilities admission growth. The range of growth was a low of 0.3% to a high of 8.2%. 13 out of 16 divisions had year-over-year growth in same facilities adjusted admissions and of the three that did not have growth, one was flat and the other two were down 1% or less. 14 out of 15 domestic divisions had growth in same facilities emergency room visits as compared to the prior year. Of this, 11 divisions had growth in excess of 3% with a high of 9.5%. The only division that did not have growth was down 0.3% year-over-year. Surgical volumes were down again this quarter as compared to the prior year. The trend was not materially different than previous quarters this year. Within surgery, cardiovascular volume trends slightly improved in total. Inpatient cardiovascular surgeries were down 3.6% for the quarter as compared to the prior year. This is a slight improvement over the September year-to-date trend which was a decline of around 5%. We did see a deteriorating trend in the most revenue intensive component of cardiovascular surgeries with open-heart related cardiovascular cases being down for the quarter 7.8%. Year-to-date September, we were down only 1.5%. This trend change was a significant component of the managed care revenue softness for the quarter with commercial volumes in this category down 19%, as compared to 5% through September. The company has rolled out a comprehensive surgery growth initiative which is designed to improve our surgical volumes. We are implementing this initiative in a manner similar to our emergency room initiative, which has yielded positive results for the company over the past few years. Included as part of this initiative are enhancements to the process of scheduling surgical cases. These enhancements which include improvement in both process and technology will make it easier and more efficient for our physicians to schedule cases, while at the same time, increasing our operating room capacity. Also, we are dedicating additional capital spending in our budget to enhance further the technology and equipment necessary to attract more surgeons. We have increased the resources in our physician outreach and communication function to ensure that any operational scheduling or equipment issues are addressed in a timely manner, also as part of this initiative, we have established that each of our hospitals have surgical services advisory council to ensure that both certain operating standards are met and our physician to have the necessary input into our surgical operations. We believe this additional effort, coupled with our comprehensive service line strategy will help differentiate us in the market over time and allow us to continue to grow market share and improved clinical outcome. And one final point on volume, which we also believe to be a part of the explanation for our managed care revenue softness is on our women’s and children’s services. Deliveries were down this quarter 2.4% on a same facility basis. Through September, we were down 0.8%, most of the difference this quarter is explained by Medicaid volume and not managed care volume. Managed care deliveries were actually up this quarter by 1.9%. Year-to-date, they were down 1.3%. Normally, this translates into more neonatal volume, but in the fourth quarter our managed care neonatal patient days were down 6.5% with length of stay accounting for 3.6% of this decline. Length of stay is generally a proxy for acuity in our neonatal units. Through September, the length of stay for our managed care neonatal business was down only 1.2%. This decline in conjunction with the decline in open-heart surgical volume explains a large portion of the change in managed care revenue for the fourth quarter. We are confident in our women’s and children’s service line strategy and believe them to be well-crafted to compete effectively in the marketplace. To wrap up, I want to provide you with our perspective as we head into 2012 on a broader trend across HCA’s market. We have studied the macro trends in our market and in addition to the forecast that Milton provided in his comments, our revenue guidance for 2010 is built in part on the following four observations. First, market demand for in-patient services is strengthening some and we are forecasting it to grow overall in the range of 0.5% to 1%. Second, market demand for emergency services should remain strong and continue to grow in the 2% to 3% range. Third, commercial enrollment and volume should remain stable. And fourth, the competitive landscape is anticipated to remain largely unchanged in comparison to 2011. We have seen our market share growth some over the past year as a result of our service line strategy, capital investment strategy, position alignment strategy and quality improvement strategy. As we move into 2012, we are anticipating a continuation of this performance. And, with that, I’ll turn the call back to Vic.
Vic Campbell: Thank you, Richard and Milton. Lila, would you like to come back on and we’ll poll for questions?
Operator: Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) Our first questions comes from Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.
Adam Feinstein – Barclays Capital: Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone and great news on the dividend payment. I guess, I just want to ask on the volume side. Clearly, your volumes had been stronger than what the market growth rate has been and Sam, I appreciated the details you gave earlier. I just wanted to just get some additional thoughts in terms of, as you guys think about the markets you’re in and just what maybe going on there with demographics and everything else. Just curious if, how you’re thinking about, your overall market share and then just on the mix question with the volumes, I guess just, what is your sense in terms of the mix impact on other hospitals in the same markets?
Richard Bracken: All right, Adam. Thank you. Sam, do you want to start out, basically he’s asking about market share and the mix shift.
Sam Hazen: Just to remind everybody once again. Our market share data is somewhat lagging and to date we are starting to get in third quarter market share data in certain markets and we have better market share data through the second quarter. And for HCA on a 12-month running basis, our market share has grown modestly and a markets like that has been slightly flat to up maybe 0.5 point over the 12-month period. And what we have seen inside that market share is generally statistics that are reflective of what we’ve been reporting. For example, women services during this time period have been down 3.5% and HCA’s market share is modestly down like 5 basis point. Our cardiology, for example, has been down about 4% in the market and HCA’s picked-up market share around 9 basis points. So within the different categories our market share trend are generally favorable, but reflective of the overall volume trends that we’ve reported over the year. I will say that I think as the year has progressed, we have picked-up slightly more market share than what we’ve reported through the second quarter with the volumes that we reported in the third quarter, as well as the volumes that we reported in the fourth quarter. I haven’t seen this specific service line data yet to understand whether or not we’re gaining or losing market share within the different service lines, but as soon as we get that information, we study it and we work with our division President’s to ensure that the information is being used to adjust our strategies and so forth. Milton, did you want to add something to it.
Milton Johnson: Just one other comment, as you know our market share data is inpatient-only, it doesn’t capture the outpatient activity. And the company, has been seeing very strong emergency room, volume growth over the past year, over 6% as Richard mentioned for the year just ended 2011. I think that strategy and the growth we’re seeing in our emergency rooms contributing to the overall adjusted admission growth that we were reporting especially over the last two quarters.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo: Thanks, good morning.
Richard Bracken: Good morning.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo: It seems like your operating expense, you had better success controlling it in the second half of the year than maybe you did in the first half of the year. And it sounds like from your comments you expect that to generally continue into next year. Any concern as you get into the second half of 2012? If there is anything specific, did anniversaries that might make some of the operating expense benefits, a little bit more difficult to get?
Richard Bracken: Mil, can you take that?
Milton Johnson: Well, sure. I think overall, no doubt during the second half of 2012 our comps will become more difficult with the operating expense performance that we have generated in 2011. I’m not aware of any particular item out there. I do think, as I have said in the comments, a low inflationary period. We’re projecting that’s going to carry through the year. We have attractive supplier initiative underway that we think will also help us. If we see a stabilization and the service mix which we’re calling for really in the second, third and fourth quarter of next year, that may put some year-over-year comp pressure on supply costs, but I don’t consider that to be a major headwind for us. So, I do think our costs, overall trends should be similar, but I think it would be more difficult in the second half of the year, certainly more difficult than you will see in the first quarter of 2012.
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo: Just on the balance sheet, if you look at the other accrued expenses accrued in the fourth quarter, is there anything in particular there is that primarily just the addition of HealthONE to the balance sheet?
Milton Johnson: Yeah. Got to -- if I understand, this deferred HITECH revenue...
Gary Lieberman – Wells Fargo: Okay. Right.
Milton Johnson: Deferred income.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question comes from with Justin Lake with UBS. Please go ahead.
Justin Lake – UBS: Thanks, good morning. Just question around the EBITDA numbers for this year and just how you’re thinking about the bigger picture from growth perspective? I think you have typically talked the EBITDA growth for the business being mid single digits. I’m backing into about 1% ex-items this year for healthcare IT and HealtONE. It makes sense. I know there are a number of moving parts, so I’m hoping you can do just two things, one, can you walk us through the moving parts that are a headwind for this? I’m thinking UPL, Medicaid, just kind of level set us. Give us a quick comment in terms of, do you still think the longer term growth for EBITDA in this business is at 5%, 6%?
Milton Johnson: Of course, the range of EBITDA growth based on the $6.2 billion to $6.45 billion, of course, would be 2.3% to 6.4% EBITDA growth all-in compared to 2011. If you look at some of the major, major pieces of it and walk through it, and again there’s different ways of cutting this no doubt and looking at it. We’re looking at next year in our guidance probably around 80 basis points to 1% sort of tailwind from HITECH. We’re also looking in the neighborhood of probably around 4% or so of tailwind from HealthONE included in that guidance. Now, the headwinds we’ve got are primarily, of course, it’s going to be the UPL, which I think we’ve guidance of probably $80 million to $90 million sort of hit there with respect to UPL, and then on Texas Medicaid, there should be about $60 million headwind there versus $20 million that we had this year. So a net $40 million impact on the growth rate. So, if you take all that into account, the pluses and minuses, we’re showing the underlying business growing about probably in that 1.5 to 3 range, somewhere in that zone.
Justin Lake – UBS: Great. Thanks for the detail.
Richard Bracken: Thanks, Justin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Susquehanna Financial.
A.J. Rice – Susquehanna Financial: Thanks, everybody. Just thought I might ask you to update us on anything new or different we’re talking about on the Parallon initiative and then specifically, the supply cost there, you’ve alluded to that a couple of times and I know last quarter you talked about our far east initiative on basic supplies any update on that as well.
Richard Bracken: Milton, you want to go again?
Milton Johnson: Yeah, I mean, Richard on Parallon, first of all here with us this morning is Michael O’Boyle who just joined us in January as our new CEO of Parallon of course to replace Beverly Wallace who retired at the end of the year. We are very, very happy to have Michael on board and his guidance of Parallon over the coming years. Really when we look at the supply agenda with respect to HPG we continue to see a good growth opportunities from HPG. We continue to see opportunities again with our contracting strategies especially as we roll out some strategies around medical devices and it’s a very market by market approach. It’s a very sensitive approach to our physicians but it is one that we believe we’ll continue to be able to yield results. One example is that we bring our supply chain strategies into the EHR opportunities there as well. So we have a lot of opportunity there with respect to, I think you’re mentioning or referencing our outsourcing imitative in China. That continues to develop at this point that initiative is not having a material impact on the company, but one we’re continuing to develop in 2012.
Richard Bracken: Thanks, A.J.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank: I wanted to just ask a little bit about managed care contracting how it’s evolving in 2012 what your general pricing outlook is on Sam, you’ve obviously given us commentary on mix. So thanks for that, but maybe more from the standpoint of how contracting is going and are you seeing bundled structures at this point in our networks just how you see that evolving in ‘12?
Richard Bracken: Juan, do you want to do that? Juan Vallarino, Heads up our Managed Care.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank: Hi, Juan.
Juan Vallarino: Hi, how you’re doing? It’s really more of the same. I assume they have very different approaches yet, if talking about our network the discussion back and forth, but I think for the foreseeable or next year it’s going to be much more the same range of the guidance given contracts virtually the same couple of pilots in there.
Richard Bracken: I’m going to remind you that we’ve got about 85% to 90% of our 2012 managed care revenue currently under contract and at 5% to 6% sort of contracted rate increased zone with structures under those contracts very similar to what we’ve been operating under in recent years. We got about half of our 2013 managed care revenue under contract and at same sort of rate growth range at this point, and again with underlying structures consistent. So, although, there would be discussions, I think it especially gets closer to 2014, and assuming healthcare reforms continues to be on track and the like. But as of now, I would say our managed care pricing and our structures are similar to what -- and largely consistent with what we have been working with in recent years.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank: If you could just help me square then the managed care pricing growth, I think you told us was 1.3% in the quarter on an equivalent admission basis, but the mix was down just only about 1%. So, may be just help us think a little bit more about that number in light of the pricing growth that you’re talking about here?
Richard Bracken: So, Sam, I think in his comments addressed the primary reasons that our yield is below our contracted rate and it has to do with basically our surgical volumes in a few areas.
Sam Hazen: Let me just add to that for one minute. I think when we look at managed care activity and I want to give you some stats through the end of year as well as the fourth quarter, because I think it will help understand what changed in the fourth quarter and caused our trend to move from 4% or so down to 1.5% to 2%, and it really involves the fact that the book of business that grew and moved up to where we were basically flat with managed care admissions for the quarter is in the medical admission category. We were up almost 3% in the fourth quarter on medical admissions. Year-to-date through September we were flat. Within medical admissions, the case mix and revenue per admission is almost 1.5 of surgical admissions. And so when you look within surgical admissions, we were down less in the fourth quarter, not a whole lot, but less, we were down about 5% in the fourth quarter and through September year-to-date are down 5.5%. In the mix, in the combination of the weighting of the differences between revenue per medical admission patient versus the revenue per surgical admission starts to bring down the composite rate. And obviously, we do okay on medical admissions, we do better on surgical admissions, but the weighting brings the overall composite revenue per adjusted admission to a number that below our contracted number. So, said another way, we just had movement in our book of business. Within surgery we did see a little bit of a decline in the cardiovascular -- a large decline actually like I said in my comment in the neonatal. That contributed to some of it, but I think the mix of business here is also a significant contributing factor. I think Sam too the comp we had last year was a pretty high, that contributed to piece of it as well.
Darren Lehrich – Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you.
Richard Bracken: Thanks, Darren.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen And Company.
Christine Arnold – Cowen And Company: Hi there, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you’re beginning to see an increase in commercial volume. Could you elaborate on what you’re seeing and do you think that we’ll see an improvement in the pricing metrics on the commercial side next year, kind of next quarter, first quarter or full year ‘12? And then could you give us the UPL numbers for this year, just for this quarter please?
Milton Johnson: Okay. This is Milton. Let me give you the trend here on our managed care adjusted admission growth for the year and this trend is encouraging relative to the 2012 outlook. Our managed care adjusted admission we had a decline of 0.6% in the first quarter of 2011 versus 2010. In the second quarter we were flat. In the third quarter we actually had growth. We grew 0.5% in managed care and other adjusted admission growth, that’s the first quarter we have reflected growth in years and that’s that. And now, in the fourth quarter we were up 0.8% in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2010. So each quarter this year a continuing improvement in the growth rate and so we’re encouraged by that as we go into 2012. Now with respect to the rates, we’re going through this service mix shift that Sam just described very well relative to the yield that we’re getting on that rate. I think we’re going to see probably continued pressure on yields in the first quarter, but as we get further into 2012, I think we’re going to see a stable -- we’re seeing a stabilization now, we’ve got a difficult comp in the first quarter of 2012 and after that we should start to see that stabilization resulting in more yield pull through closer to our contracted rate rather than what we’re seeing now. With respect to UPL, for the quarter we’ve reported EBITDA from the UPL program in the fourth quarter of $48 million that compares to $86 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the year, $231 million of EBITDA UPL program versus $304 million in 2010. So, a $73 million decline for the year, $38 million for the quarter.
Christine Arnold – Cowen And Company: On the managed care adjusted admissions, are you expecting that to be a positive turf in 2012?
Richard Bracken: Well, we’re not giving guidance on details about payer on volume, again, but we are encouraged looking at the trend going into 2012, especially with some of the recent news around unemployment, that picture looking a little bit better as well.
Christine Arnold – Cowen And Company: Okay. Thank you.
Richard Bracken: Thanks, Christine.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning. Looking at your really strong free cash flow and in fact you paid this special dividend. I’m just curious how will you be thinking about that in the future be it additional dividends, be it share repurchases and kind of what was the criteria that really sets you up to do that dividend this quarter. So just some color there about how you think about the world going forward, particularly going into 2013?
Milton Johnson: Thank you, Frank. Richard, do you want to do that?
Richard Bracken: Yeah, obviously, the way we think about the special dividend, it’s really a method of returning some liquidity to all of our shareholders. And without requiring them to reduce their ownership position and so this is really -- this makes a lot of sense given the interest rates and the generally lower industry valuation environment. We have said repeatedly that our strong cash position allows us to be very flexible in creating value and that’s going to be our go forward strategy. A strong cash flow allows us lots of choices you saw over 2011. We not only fully sourced our capital budgets, but we repurchased the shares from Bank of America 80 million shares. We’ve completed key acquisitions and all these issues are -- we will evaluate as we go forward. Strong cash flow gives us that positive set of choices and we’ll continue to play that kind of discipline to where we can create value for the shareholders and still maintain our market position. And we’ll be flexible and supple about that as we go forward.
Frank Morgan – RBC Capital Markets:  Thanks.
Richard Bracken: Thanks, Frank.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital. Please go ahead.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital: Good morning, gentlemen, and very nice job to everyone pulling out of a difficult second quarter into a much stronger second half. But you’ve done it before, so I guess you pulled the rule book out and adopted it and you did a good job. But I want to look forward a little bit, and while I don’t want to dump any kind of cold water on what should be a very nice party today. I do need to ask about readmissions and that little lawsuit down in Florida, so not related, but I think two important things. First of all, if I understand all of your strategies correctly from a quality of care point of view from an accuracy and process and clinical protocol point of view, I would understand you to already be working towards reducing unnecessary or avoidable readmissions. So, there’s two questions about that. One, by how much more would your volumes be growing if you weren’t avoiding those readmissions? Two, how much more do you have to go? Three, what are you including in your guidance for fourth quarter of 2012 when the rules changed for payment? And then if you could tell us what the situation is with the lawsuit down in Florida? It’s great, we appreciate it.
Richard Bracken: All right, Sheryl. I’m going to bump, as you would expect, to Jon Perlin the readmission discussion. John is our Chief Medical Officer as you well know, make sure everybody else knows, but on the litigation, we have pretty standard policy over the years that we do not comment on pending litigation. So, I would like to leave it at that on that particular case at this point.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital: Great.
Jon Perlin: Well, thanks Rick, in the area of readmission as you probably know, the initial CMS data have come out. They’re tracking readmissions for heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia. And our data look pretty comfortable to the industry and in some instances better. Obviously, it’s an area where we want to make sure that patient care is integrated. it’s an area tests us in terms of continuity care models and with the large number of employed providers, especially in the area of cardiovascular services, we have the opportunity to create longitudinal relationships, as well as with our voluntary medical staff. So, it’s an area where we see a good connection between the hospital-based services and non-hospital based services. And if there is any opportunity capacity created that would be one potential benefit, but we see this really an opportunity for good patient care across to continue.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital: Okay. I’m sorry. I understand that and I think I understand the nuances there of connecting with the non-hospital base continuing, which seems to be the key because you can’t control what happens after they’re discharged, but what I’m also trying to get at is, there seems to be for those hospital companies that perhaps have not been proactive in trying to improve the process and quality of care and reduce not only unnecessary readmissions, but also length of stay, there would be a difference between your already industry leading volume growth. In other words, if you weren’t avoiding those readmissions, can you give me a sense or will you be able to give us a sense at some point as to how much you are leaving on the table?
Sam Hazen: Sheryl, this is Sam Hazen. I think just to add to what John said and it’s through our analysis and our programs and other efforts, at this particular point in time we’re viewing readmission as an immaterial risk to sort of our volume metrics at this particular point in time.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital: Okay. All right. That’s great. I think I get that. Could you just explain the big tax item in the cash flow this year and how much you’re looking for cash flow from operations for next year?
Richard Bracken: Sure, Milton?
Milton Johnson: Yeah, with respect to tax item, we settled a couple of tax cases closed out a couple of years and we picked up about $172 million in refunds related to those years. So, now I believe we have all of our tax years closed through 2004. And so we’re very pleased to get those settled and agreed to we think in terms of reasonable. So, we did pick up a refund. Of course, that should not reoccur. Also, this year and into fourth quarter we benefited from accelerated depreciation with some of the tax law changes as a result of the recession, so able to expense for tax faster than we are writing off or depreciating the book. That certainly helped our effective tax rate as well during the year. Of course, that will work against us the future period. As far as the our cash flow from ops going forward, of course, another thing benefited this year, it was the HITECH incentive payment, it also was a benefit to our cash this year. So, going forward I would say that our cash flow operations for next year would range probably around $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion framed around the same range of our EBITDA target that we’ve given.
Sheryl Skolnick – CRT Capital: I think I’m just going to quit my job and go buy HCA’s stocks and bonds because you guys keep returning lots of value to shareholders, so thank you.
Richard Bracken: Thank you, Sheryl.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with Citigroup.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Hi, good morning, good quarter. The question I just wanted to focus on was as you think about the fourth quarter of 2012, a couple moving parts, one I think I’m understanding that unless the Texas Medicaid waiver has extended, there’s some risk to the continuing UPL benefit and I wasn’t, I wasn’t clear exactly maybe what you are assuming for the year? And then the second part of the question for the fourth quarter is obviously there’s a pretty wide range of potential outcomes on the Medicare update given the MS-DRG coding add back and the potential for some other coding callback et cetera those two items almost net each other off in my mind in the dollar fashion for 4Q, but I’m just wondering what’s your range of expectations were for those two items?
Richard Bracken: I think on the Medicare side Gary all we’re doing -- we’re projecting current law. Obviously there will be inpatient update you want to have you that will be a with, but at this point our expectations and estimates are based on current law. In terms of UPL, I know Mil you talked a little about the down graph that we expect and it relates, I don’t know so much of fourth quarter, it relates to the full year.
Milton Johnson: It relates to the full year about probably $80 million to $90 million of additional drop in EBITDA from UPL program for 2012 versus 2011. Of course, like I said, we did have a $73 million decline in 2011 versus 2010. We’ve just used our best information. There’s still some uncertainty and details we don’t know about the new waiver and how it’s going to play out in some of our markets, but we’ve used our best information, our best estimate to come up with the guidance that we’re giving on UPL for 2012, but there is certainly still some moving parts.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup: Am I right that that waiver would have to get extended again to preserve even that diminished level of funding? Is it a waiver for one-year? Am I right?
Milton Johnson: Its five years.
Richard Bracken: Gary, it’s a five-year waiver, I mean there could be adjustments in how the waiver is implemented clearly during that five-year period. So, it’s a five-year wavier.
Gary Taylor – Citigroup:  Great.
Richard Bracken: Gary, Thanks.
Vic Campbell: We’ve got time for one last question.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Tom Gallucci with Lazard.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard: And thank you for letting me slip into the wire there back…
Richard Bracken: (Inaudible) I wouldn’t have let you through.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard: So much for old friend, I guess. Any way, just really two follow-ups, One, you pointed to the neonatal trends there Sam earlier. I was curious what sort of volatility do you normally see in that business? Can you point anything that’s maybe unique now or is it explainable? I think Gary, just sort of touching on the Washington environment and some of the variables, I know you’re particularly active there Vic. Any color that you all can offer in terms of what you are hearing and what might out on specific initiatives that are on the table right one?
Richard Bracken: One thing that’s happened within our neonatal businesses is the clinical initiatives that we put towards many years ago and I think HCA has some credit externally around 39-week policies and so forth and that has had some impact on our neonatal unit. The other thing that we’ve seen across the market is, infertility volumes through infertility clinics had been down during the recession, which makes sense to me at a certain level and that does have some implication on multiple birth and how it plays out in the neonatal setting. Outside of that, we’re really not seeing anything material that we can point to with neonatal activity across the company. So, those are just some high level observations that we think have had some impact. Again, the fourth quarter was dramatically different in the first nine months of the year, so I’m not necessarily focusing in on that as any kind of significant trend change. It’s just that component of the explanation for this quarter.
Vic Campbell: And, Tom, this is Vic. On Washington, you know, probably as much as I know. Right now, clearly, we have got a Doc Fix Bill that goes through at the end of February. I think the general thinking is, it gets extended for 10 months through the end of the year and the payfors that are being discussed are the same payfors that were out there at the end of last year, last year they were talking about a two-year fix versus 10-month. There are some. However, they would like to fix this and resolve it in its entirety, and there is a good bit of discussion about the OCF funds possibly being use there, but there are lot of folks who would like to use those funds as well. So, your guess is as good as mine. Again, looking at the Doc Fix Bill, it’s not a terribly material amount of money they have to come up with if they have to deal with it on a 10-monht basis. Outside of that particularly piece, I don’t think much happening in healthcare legislation this year, it’s more of an election year.
Tom Gallucci – Lazard:  Okay. Thank you.
Richard Bracken: All right. With that I want to thank everybody for being on the call. Mark and I are here all day. So look forward to see and talking to many of you. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That will conclude today’s presentation. We appreciate your attendance. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the HCA third quarter 2011 earnings release conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call conference over to the Senior Vice President Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead sir.
Victor Campbell: Carla, thank you and good morning everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our Chief Investor Relations Officer is here with me this morning and we would like to welcome everyone on today's call, also to those of you that are listening to the webcast. Here in the room with me this morning are Chairman and CEO Richard Bracken, President and CFO Milton Johnson, Sam Hazen, President of Operations, and then we have a cast of other characters here, senior officers of the company that can help us during the Q&A. Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward-looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of the factors that are listed in today's press release are included in our various SEC filings. Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events. This morning's call is being recorded. A replay will be available starting later today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Richard Bracken.
Richard Bracken: All right. Thank you Vic, and good morning to all. We do appreciate your participation on our call this morning. This has been a very busy quarter for all of us at HCA, so we have a lot to comment on this morning. Before we get started, let me thank many of you for the meetings over the last month as we provided commentary on the company and market dynamics. So, let’s get started. First Earnings, for the quarter we reported adjustment EBITDA growth of 4% or $1.412 billion, well this does include revenues for meeting Stage 1 Meaningful Use requirements, excluding both HITECH revenues and expenses, our adjusted EBITDA grew 1.3% over last year’s third quarter. From an operations perspective, our earnings were achieved primarily due to strong patient volumes and expense control despite a continued softness in revenues per unit. During the quarter we continued on track for a successful rollout of our electronics health records initiative consistent with meeting Stage 1 Meaningful Use requirements. As delineated in our release this morning, we recorded both Medicare and Medicaid incentive revenues as certain of our hospitals completed their attestation process. During the fourth quarter we will continue the process of attestation and we expect that most all of our remaining hospitals will also meet performance standards. We are quite satisfied with our performance in this regard. I believe this could be a major accomplishment for our organization, albeit only a first step in a long process. It represents solid execution by our operating quality performance in IT&S [ph] teams and is an important foundational step in our ability to create a digitalized medical record to a system providing cost efficient and effective healthcare services. Our review indicates that at this point only a fraction of all US hospitals are expected to attest in 2011, we are proud to be part of this group. Also during the quarter our finance team has been exceedingly active in the quarter, we refinanced approximately $7 billion of existing indebtedness that net will lower our annual interest expense and strengthen our balance sheet. These transactions coupled with the financing activities in the second quarter are expected to generate annual interest savings of approximately $350 million next year and we expect the EPS impact to be accretive by approximately $0.47 in 2012. Additionally, on September, 21st, recall that we were successful in repurchasing more 80 million shares of our common stocks from Bank of America. This repurchase represented a buyout of their equity interest and resulted in the termination of any governance rights they had. We estimate this repurchase of nearly 16% of our outstanding shares will be accretive to EPS by approximately $0.46 in 2012. And finally shortly after the quarter ended, we completed the purchase of the remaining 40% of our HealthONE Joint Venture in the Denver market for $1.45 billion. We are very pleased with the opportunity to purchase this remaining equity percentage. We have appreciated our association with the Colorado Health Foundation over the past years. Look forward to continuing the very solid performance that our partnership had achieved and to serving the Denver community for many years to come. We do estimate that this acquisition will be accretive to EPS by approximately $0.12 in 2012. Now, a few thoughts on some of the operating highlights for the third quarter. Our patient volumes for the quarter including our newly acquired facilities continued in line with recent favourable trends. Reported admissions for the quarter were up 4.8% and reported equivalent admissions increased 5.4%. Similarly, on a same facility basis, we reported that admissions and equivalent admissions grew 3.2% and 3.8%, respectively. We have now experienced 16 quarters in a row of positive equivalent admission growth. Also consistent with strong admission growth we continued our favourable trends in same facility emergency visit growth with a 4.9% growth rate for the third quarter. I think that you generally, are aware that we believe this growth reflects not only favourable facility locations and areas with favourable growth dynamics, but also an operating agenda that seeks to improve the efficiency in which we process patients through our system. With these strong volumes, our company reported revenues for the quarter totalling $7.31 billion up 5.5% from $6.93 billion last year. Same facility revenue grew 3.7% in the quarter or about 60 basis points favourable to our second quarter growth. Our primary challenge in the quarter is reflected in our revenue per equivalent admission growth of only 0.2%. Milton and Sam will provide more on this in a moment, but as we indicated in our release this morning, we continue to experience growth in medical admissions and declines in surgical admissions, this obviously led to lower revenue per unit equivalent admission. As we mentioned on our last two conference calls, when we identified this revenue issue back in the second quarter, our operator set in motion a number of adjustments. The efforts of our operating teams during the quarter were effective as reflected in our operating expenses per equivalent admission increasing only 0.5% for the quarter. You will also hear more about our cost management agenda in just a few moments. And finally, let me mention that in September the joint commission for accreditation of hospital organization recognized 76 HCA hospitals among 405 US hospitals as top performers on key quality measures. The joint commission recognized these hospitals for evidenced-based care processes closely linked to positive patient outcomes as demonstrated by attaining and sustaining excellence in accountability measured performance. Only 14% of the joint commission accredited hospitals earn this distinction and we were proud that HCA hospitals were among them On that note let me close and turn the call over to Milton.
Milton Johnson: Thank you Richard and good morning to all. Hopefully everyone has had an opportunity to review the company’s third quarter earnings release issued earlier today. As noted in our release this morning, we have chosen early adoption of the provisions of accounting standards update number 2011-07 for the presentation of patient service revenue and provision for bad debts for the periods ended September, 30 2011. The new accounting standard changes presentation of the provisions for bad debts from our operating expense through a deduction from patient service revenue. This new presentation is consistent with our previous presentation of cash revenue and cash expenses that we supplementally provided to investors over the past few years. As Richard mentioned, the third quarter results provided strong volume growth and excellent expense management. However, we did continue to experience an unfavourable shift in service mix much like the second quarter, resulting in lower equity and revenue per adjusted admission growth. Revenues in the third quarter increased 5.5% to $7.31 billion primarily driven by increased patient volumes. Same facility revenues increased 3.7%. As noted in this morning’s release, the company recognized $51 million of HITECH revenues comprised of $34 million of Medicaid incentives and $17 million of Medicare incentives in the third quarter. Additionally, we incurred $14 million of expense related HITECH implementation in the third quarter. Net income in the third quarter totalled $61 million, or a $0.11 per diluted share which includes pre-tax losses on retirement of debt of $406 million, or $0.49 per diluted share related to the company’s debt refinancing during the third quarter. Tax rate in the third quarter was favourably impacted by the finalization of certain settlements for the tax years 1997 through 2001. These settlements resulted in a reduction to the company’s tax related interest expense of $66 million pre-tax, or $0.08 per diluted share. Shares used in computing our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2011 increased 20.2% from the third quarter 2010, due primarily to the issuance of shares in the company’s IPO in March of this year. The repurchase of 80.8 million Bank of America shares had an immaterial impact on the share count in the quarter due to the September 21 closing of the transaction. During the third quarter, same facility admissions increased 3.2%, while same facility equivalent admissions increased 3.8%, the company’s strongest growth in same facility equivalent admissions since the third quarter of 2009. Consolidated admissions and equivalent admissions, which include recent acquisitions, increased 4.8% and 5.4%, respectively. As noted in our release, patient volumes in the quarter were driven by higher medical admits of 5.7 %, while surgical admits decreased 1.4%. This compares to our second quarter when medical admits increased 3.7% and surgical admits decreased 1.6%. We continue to see growth in volumes from patients covered by governmental programs. Same facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 4.4% and 5.3% respectively compared to the prior year’s third quarter. Our same facility Medicare admissions included both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 6.8% on the same facility basis and represents 24.1% of our total Medicare admissions. Same facility Medicaid admissions increased 5.8% and same facility equivalent admissions increased 5.2% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility managed care and other admissions decreased 0.8% in the quarter. However, same facility equivalent admissions actually increased 0.5% in the third quarter as compared to the prior year. This is the first quarter in several years where we have experienced growth in our same facility managed care and other equivalent admissions. Same facility total surgical volume in the third quarter declined 1.1% from the prior year and Sam will provide additional insights into our surgical volumes following my comments. Same facility uninsured admissions increased by 8.8%, or 2,489 admissions in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Same facility uninsured admissions represent 7.8% of total admits in the quarter compared 7.4% in the third quarter of 2010. Same facility ER business increased 4.9% in the third quarter as compared to prior year. Now, a few comments on revenue. Our revenue growth was driven by strong same facility equivalent admission growth in the quarter. The unfavourable shift in our service mix during the quarter is reflected in our same facility revenue per adjusted admission decline of 0.1% for the third quarter. Without HITECH related revenues, same facility revenue per equivalent admission declined 0.8% for the third quarter. Same facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission declined 0.6% in the quarter. Same facility Medicare CMI declined 1.8% from last year’s third quarter and declined 0.4% on a sequential comparison to the second quarter of this year. Same facility Medicaid revenue per equivalent admission excluding UPL declined by 2.5% in the third quarter compared to the prior year. The decline in Medicaid rate per equivalent admission is primarily attributed to Florida funding reductions. During our previous earnings call we provided the estimated impact of Medicaid reimbursement cuts in both Florida and Texas. We have revised our estimates as follows. In Florida, we previously estimated Medicaid reimbursement cuts to be approximately 50 million annualized impact, effective July 1, 2011. Based on the final published rates from the state of Florida, we have revised the assessment upward to be an annualized impact of 70 million, 35 million in the second half of 2011 and 35 million in the first half of 2012. This represents the impact of the state Medicaid rate cuts, the flow through of the rate cuts to manage Medicaid contracts, and the reduction of low income for re-imbursement. The original estimates were based on the information available to management at that time. The revised estimate reflects the state’s final calculations resulted in the actual rate cut being worse than our original estimates. The newly revised estimate is included in our 2011 full-year earnings guidance. In Texas, we previously estimated Medicaid reimbursements cuts to be approximately 25 to 30 million annualized impacts effective September 1, 2011. Based on our understanding, the final published rules in the state of Texas, we have revised this estimate upwards to be an annualized impact of 80 million, 20 million in 2011 and 60 million in 2012. This represents the impact of the state Medicaid rate cut and the flow through of that rate cut to manage Medicaid contracts. The original estimates were based on information available to management at that time and this newly revised estimate is also included in our 2011 full-year earnings guidance. Now moving to managed care, same facility managed care revenue and other insured per equivalent admission increased 3.8% in the quarter. This growth rate compares to 5.5% growth in the first quarter and 4.9% growth in the second quarter of this year. The declining rate of growth is attributable to the changes in managed care service mix compared to last year’s third quarter. Same facility managed care and other case mix increased 0.9% over the last year’s third quarter. The monthly trend on our managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission growth rate was as follows In July, we were up 2.7%, in August we increased 4.3%, and in September we increased 4.7%. After an unusually low rate of growth in July, we saw an improving growth rate in August and September. Same facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased by 349 million in the third quarter compared to the prior year and during the third quarter the same facility charity care discounts totalled 676 million, an increase of 92 million from the prior year while the same facility uninsured discounts totalled 1.432 billion, an increase of 257 million from the prior year. We were very pleased with expense management in the third quarter, as same facility operating expense per equivalent admission increased only 0.1% compared to the prior year. On a reported basis, operating expense per equivalent admission increased 0.5%. Salaries per equivalent admission on the same facility basis increased 0.6% in the quarter compared to the prior year. (inaudible) performance as measured by man-hours per equivalent admission improved 3.4% while the company improved 2.2% on the same facility basis compared to the prior year. Wage rate growth for the third quarter was 2% on the same facility basis compared to the prior year. Same facility supply cost per equivalent admission declined to 3.5% in the third quarter, reflecting benefits from our contracting pricing established by our GPO Health Trust Purchasing Group, a decline in high intensity surgical volumes and several supply cost saving initiatives. Same facility other operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2% in the quarter consistent with prior quarters and reflective of several small variances from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $1.412 billion in the third quarter from $1.357 billion in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 30 basis points to 19.3% from 19.6% in the prior year third quarter, reflecting a slower revenue growth, an increased position employment expenses. Same facility personnel cost associated with our physician employment company increased to 247 million in the third quarter of this year compared to 192 million in the third quarter of 2010. Bad debts plus security, noninsured discounts and as a percentage of revenue plus bad debts, charity and uninsured discounts was 28.3% compared to 26.4% for the third quarter of 2010. We currently have 92% of our self pay book reserve, upfront collections totalled 78 million, up 2.8% from the prior year. Our cash flows from operating activities decreased to 880 million from 1.256 billion in the prior year’s third quarter, primarily due to changes in working capital items. The reduction of cash flow in the third quarter was more of a reflection of the strength in cash flows in the working capital items in the third quarter of 2010, which includes by approximately 490 million, while the cash flow is related to changes in working capital items for the current quarter, were relatively flat. As an example, accounts receivable went down approximately 20 million in the third quarter of this year, but was down approximately 130 million in the third quarter of 2010. So although, positive to cash flow in the third quarter of this year, a significant decline from the prior years’ third quarter. Accounts payable, salaries payable, and accrued expenses increased by approximately 270 million in the third quarter of 2010, but declined by approximately 40 million in the current quarter, resulting in approximately 310 million negative impact on cash flows through the third quarter of 2011, compared to the third quarter of 2010. I believe this was primarily due to timing issues from period-to-period. Based on accounts receivables at the end of the third quarter were 49 days which compares to 48 days at September 30, 2010. These calculations have been made based upon revenues after predation for those accounts in both periods. Capital expenditures totalled $394 million during the quarter. At September 30, 2011, the company’s debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.53 times compared to 4.36 times at June 30, 2011. At the end of third quarter, we had $1.928 billion of liquidity available under our senior secured credit facilities. The company completed significant refinancing activities during the third quarter which will provide significant interests with expense reductions in future period. Considering the impact of the repurchase of 80.8 million shares from the Bank of America, I would expect the company’s diluted share account to be approximately 457 million shares for the fourth quarter of 2011 and 497 million shares for the full year of 2011. As previously mentioned, the HealthONE acquisition closed on October 14. We will use November 1, 2011, as the effective date for accounting purposes, therefore HealthONE would be accounted for on a consolidated basis effective November 1. Annual revenues associated with HealthONE are approximately 2 billion. In closing, I’d like to address fourth quarter expectations for HITECH revenues. We would expect based upon completion of our attestations that the company would recognize additional HITECH revenues of 310 to 340 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2011, we expect HITECH revenues of 400 million to 430 million. We expect HITECH related expenses of 15 to 25 million in the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2011, we expect HITECH expenses of 75 to 85 million. Our fourth quarter estimated HITECH revenues and our full-year estimate now includes an estimated 60 million of incentives attributable to year two of Stage 1 Meaningful Use. We expect to begin accruing the pro rata estimate of our second payment and give a HITECH incentive revenues during October 2011. Our previous HITECH guidance for 2011 did not include any year two incentives. This morning we are confirming our 2011 adjusted EBITDA guidance of 3 to 5% growth. Our guidance includes HITECH related revenues and expenses but excludes the recently closed HealthONE transaction. With or without the estimated 60 million of accrued year two HITECH incentives for fourth quarter of this year. We expect to be within a 3 to 5% adjusted EBITDA guidance range for 2011. Although, with the additional 60 million we now expect to be near the top of that range. I’d now – I’ll turn the call over to Sam Hazen. Sam Hazen Good Morning. I am going to begin my comments this morning with you in various components of our volumes for the second quarter. First I want to speak to the balance across our portfolio, which again this quarter is a favorable factor for the company. 14 out of 16 divisions had growth in same facility inpatient admissions for the quarter. Of the two divisions that were down, one was down only 0.2% and the other was down 0.6%. 15 out of 16 divisions had growth in same facility adjusted admission and for the third consecutive quarter all divisions had growth in same facility emergency room visits. The only volume indicator that had inconsistent performance across the company were surgeries, only six divisions had growth in same facility total surgery which combined in-patient and out-patient volumes. We continue to experience softness in our surgical volumes. In-patient surgical admits represented 31.3% of total admits for the third quarter. This is down from 32.8% in the third quarter of the prior year. Year-to-date through June, surgical admits represented 30.9% of total admits. Seasonally, surgical admits in the third quarter represent a greater percentage of total admits, as compared to the first half of the year. This year’s third quarter seasonality factor was slightly down only 20 basis points as compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Once again cardiovascular surgical procedures represented the majority of our decline. Cardiovascular surgical procedures were down 6% in the third quarter, as compared to the third quarter of prior year.
 : Now, let me transition to market share data. As a reminder, we typically have a 90- to 180-day delay in getting market share data to analyze. So the most current data we have is for the second quarter in certain markets. We have received market share data for 11 major markets, which includes data from the following states Texas, Virginia, Nevada, Utah and Colorado. In total, for all payers in these markets, cardiovascular demand both medical and surgical decline in the second quarter of 2011 by 2.4%. Medical cardiovascular demand, which makes up almost 60% of the total, declined by 1.8% during this time period and surgical related cardiovascular demand declined by 3.4%. HCA in these 11 markets picked up a 140 basis points of cardiovascular share. On the medical side, HCA picked up 210 basis points and on the surgical side HCA picked up 30 basis points. Of the 11 markets studied, 7 were up in total cardiovascular share, 6 were up in medical and 7 were up in surgical. Although, we are still dealing with pressures on our cardiovascular surgical volumes, I am encouraged by our hospital’s efforts to grow high acuity business in other areas. For example, in the third quarter we saw 2.7% growth in admissions to our intensive care units. Our efforts to expand the market areas that we serve by affiliating with other facilities and providers in rural markets are maturing and as a result we are seeing market share gain on in-migration business. The most recent market share data shows that HCA has grown its in-migration share in these rural markets by 73 basis points. Our physician strategies are focused in these areas also and finally the company has rolled out a number of operational initiatives to improve our surgical department and make them more attractive to our surgeons. And to wrap up, let me make a few comments about our operating costs. Milton mentioned the positive trends in the quarter. We have numerous efforts at the hospital level to improve the day-to-day shift-to-shift components of our labor cost management. These efforts include an enhanced scheduling management system, which allows our hospital to adjust our staffing levels more timely to fluctuations in both census levels and patient acuity. Also we have improved our human resource systems which helped our hospitals manage premium paid practices more effectively thus reducing the most expensive components of labor. Additionally, we have many corporate initiatives that are designed to support our hospitals and reduce the overhead cost in our company. An example of this is our consolidation of coding into a shared service environment. Another example of this is our comprehensive supply-chain agenda which continues to produce good cost trends for the company and finally we continue to implement numerous clinical excellence initiatives that we believe will deliver better patient care, greater physician engagement and reduced cost by eliminating inefficient processes and unnecessary variations, that concludes my comments, so I’ll return the call back to Vic.
Victor Campbell: Alright. I thank everyone. Carla [ph], if you can please come back on and we will call for questions. I do want to ask today that people really try to hold to your questions to one at a time so we can get people. We do want to be respectful knowing that many of you need to be on a call, another earnings call in about 30 minutes, so with that Carla [ph].
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Thanks good morning. Just want to go back to the pricing metric, maybe it will be helpful if you could just go through just pure pricing increases on each of the books of business, just in terms of what your expectations are for managed care? It was helpful to get the Medicaid color, but just in terms of an aggregate, what should we think about in terms of cuts on the Medicaid side? And then the Medicare increase? And then I may have missed it, did you give just an overall drag from mix?
Richard Bracken: All right. Milton, you want to take that?
Milton Johnson: Yes. Well, basically our overall revenue for adjusted admission was basically flat the third quarter over a year ago and basically looking at it by payer for the third quarter on a same facility basis. Our traditional Medicare was down 0.7%, again reflecting the lowercase mix index that we reported is well down 1.8%. Managed Medicare was basically flat it’s actually down 0.1%. Medicare, I am sorry, Medicaid excluding UPL was down 2.5% for adjusted admission and our managed care and other book was up 3.8% third quarter over a year ago. And as I mentioned, that managed care and other rate growth was adversely impacted by a very unusually low rate in July of under 3% and the saw it rebound to up to 4.7% by September, but the average came in at 3.8%.
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then as we sort of think about things going forward, any commentary on how we should think about even sort of the contribution between sort of that adjusted admission and the revenue per adjusted admission?
Milton Johnson: Well, I think – right now our revenue growth is being driven by volume and that's where we are seeing the top line growth was primarily driven by the strong volumes that we are seeing in the third quarter. We are optimistic about our volumes in the fourth quarter. With respect to rate, although we did receive about 1% Medicare rate in October. We continue to see the impact of the cuts from Medicaid relative to the net revenue per adjusted admission rate increases. So I think as you look at the fourth quarter, again the hard part is this acuity trend and how it will play out in the fourth quarter, but assuming it continues – it stabilizes and continues where it is. I think you'll continue to see as be [ph] flattish rate maybe up or down a few points, but primarily top line driven by a volume in the fourth quarter.
Richard Bracken: And Milton, you may add, we have really haven't seen material changes at managed care pricing as we go forward.
Milton Johnson: In the contracted rate, that's correct. We are continuing to see our contracts, we are about roughly 65% to 70% through the 2012 revenue book on our managed care contracts and we are at a rate of approximately 6% increase from managed care.
Richard Bracken: Alright. Thank you Ralph.
Operator: And moving on, we will hear from Justin Lakes with UBS.
Justin Lakes – UBS: Thanks good morning. My question was just around trying to put together the pieces for next year. I know you haven't given guidance, but I would like to just kind of walk through the head winds and tail winds that we know about. For instance, you gave some Medicaid numbers. Just wanted to get an update on UPL, the healthcare IT year-over-year, and then maybe the HealthONE contribution that should be tail wind next year and kind of the one-time items?
Richard Bracken: I think, yes one we can talk, we have sort of talked a little bit about, but Justin we're not going to get into this the pieces for guidance for next year and I know everyone would love to do that but we will do that on our next quarter's call. So, we have laid out the Medicaid that we know about because those changes took place both in Texas and in Florida. I think we’ve talked about HealthONE, Milton.
Milton Johnson: Nearly about $250 million additional EBITDA next year over the – EBITDA will pickup for the last two months of this year.
Richard Bracken: Yes. And then obviously the Medicare payment rates are out there in terms we saw that rate October 1 at roughly 1%. But the other parts are obviously moving, we know it is piecemeal, but we want to come back to you with the very comprehensive look at next year with appropriate guidance. Same way with HITECH, we do have – you may want to readdress that accrual just a little bit to make sure they understand that item as it relates to the fourth quarter and we'll have better guidance to on next year on HITECH.
Milton Johnson: Yes. So with respect to as I said, with respect to the fourth quarter we're expecting to book HITECH revenues of $310 million to $340 million during the fourth quarter. The expenses in the fourth quarter related to that would be anywhere from $15 million to $25 million in the fourth quarter. And again, that revenue range that I gave you did include an expected $60 million accrual. We are converting from basically the recognition of the revenue when we attest to meeting the HITECH Meaningful 1 standards to an accrual basis starting now with the effect of October 1st. Now we are in year two Stage 1 Meaningful Use and we're going to accrue the revenue associated with the year two starting October 1st. We estimate that accrual to be about $60 million of additional revenue and we haven't included that in our guidance for the full year 2011.
Richard Bracken: And I guess my last comment, Richard, reminds me, I mean, we are just in the midst of our budget process which really runs up end of December. And so, we have an, very expensive budget process that we need to go through before we get to the guidance level.
Justin Lakes – UBS: No problem, thanks.
Richard Bracken: Thank you.
Justin Lakes – UBS: Got it.
Richard Bracken: If we could go to the next question, we are running tight here.
Operator: And now we'll hear from Sheryl Skolnick with CRT Capital.
Richard Bracken: Hi Sheryl.
Sheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital: Good morning everyone. Thank you for all of that. Can we go back to the cash flows and particular emphasis trying to understand the difference in the accounting on the accruals versus the prior revenue recognition for the HITECH. So first of all, if there are timing differences in the cash flow in this quarter, when will we see those timing differences made up, that’s question number one? And question number two, talk to me about the pattern of the receipt of cash for all of the HITECH revenues that we need to get used to and we need to understand because I suspect strongly that your cash flow in the fourth quarter will not be as robust as your EBITDA?
Milton Johnson: Sheryl, this is Milton. Let me try to take on that. First of all, I refer to the timing issues, it had to do with that accounts payable and salaries payable and accrued expenses that – the way the cut off dropped and happened in the – a year ago, we realized more benefits on the cash flow in the third quarter and then this year the way the cut off occurred, the timing of it, it is such that we didn't see it. So, I think that those are just timing issues as opposed to a real change in an annual run rate of our cash flows related to those working capital items.
Sheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital: So, did they slide into the fourth quarter or were they in the second quarter?
Milton Johnson: I'm not sure, Sheryl, right now. I haven't looked at that whether – I think our second quarter cash flows were pretty strong that I can't say that it is best attributable to that reason. But for the point, I'm getting at, for the full year if you think about cash flow for HCA, I don't think that this is going to be a drag on the full year. Relative to HITECH, we do expect – I'm not exactly sure of the timing obviously, we haven't ever received these funds before, we are receiving cash from certain states with respect to the Medicaid associations that we have made in certain states. With respect to the larger Medicare and the federal money, the way we're planning for – we to expect to receive some of that money in the fourth quarter of this year and there is some that we have about $100 million or so I think we have planned to receive in early part of the first quarter, but that's our best estimate. Again going through this as we try to understand the timing, with respect to the $60 million accrual that I mentioned though for the fourth quarter of 2011, we would not expect to receive that cash until the fourth quarter of 2012. So as we accrue this revenue throughout the year we will be building up the receivable that we will not receive towards the end of the year.
Sheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital: Okay. So we should think of that instead of having a lump sum fourth quarter payment as we did this year and a lot of risk around that, you are accruing as you achieve?
Milton Johnson: Yes. The reason is we have systems in place, dashboards in place, tracking mechanisms in place that we know where we stand relative to meeting the requirements of meaningful use.
Sheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital: Got it.
Milton Johnson: And so, we can – as we see the – we will have to adjust of course our accrual, as we see a hospital or two fall off and we can’t – we then believe they cannot meet the requirements, will have to adjust our accruals for that hospital. So it'll be a fluid accrual throughout the year, but based on our performance for the first 90-day period of Meaningful Use Stage 1 year 1, we believe that going through the accrual method is a better accounting recognition method than the lump sum.
Sheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital: Okay. Thanks very much.
Richard Bracken: Thank you.
Operator: Moving on. We will hear from Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: All right thank you. Good morning everyone. It seems like you guys simply did a great job of mitigating some of the impacts from the acuity issue. So I guess my question is just, can you just break out what the impact on the revenue per adjusted admin was from the acuity in other quarter? I think the last quarter you broke out $74 million number, just want to see what is the comparable number this quarter would be? And then just as we get to the mitigation, Sam it’s helpful you spoke about some of the initiatives in place, was just curious in terms of as you give this costs as ongoing savings, I am just curious if you have a number in terms of run rate savings from the various initiatives you have outlined?
Milton Johnson: Maybe the acuity question. The 74 million that you referenced, that my belief was the total Medicare revenue attributable to all of the factors we described, including prior-year cost report (inaudible) and alike. I think at the end of the day we attributed about 25 million of that 74 to the acuity issue. We were down I think 1.4, 1.2 –, 1.4 in acuity and the second quarter we were down 1.8. So I haven't updated that number but I would assume it's going to be something around the same probably financial impact of $25 million to $30 million for this year as far as the acuity impact would be my best estimate based on the work we did the second quarter.
Richard Bracken: Sam, you want to talk about cost going forward?
Milton Johnson: Well let me just, just generally on cost. We get a lot of questions. Our cost performance has been very good and how sustainable is it. And let me just give you a couple of broad thoughts and how we think about it. First of all, our cost agenda is not static, it’s not like there are certain things we can do and that’s it. It continues to grow, there is new ideas all the time and we develop these ideas from different sources. The most fundamental source of course is 160 hospitals out there, all trying to solve many of the same problem and we get ideas and we move them across the system as you know and it’s been very, very productive for us as a company over a time. We look at benchmarking externally, of course and as Sam mentioned during his remarks, we are adding technology, he mentioned the example of technology to help us do our forecasting as the label lines and alike. The fundamental issue for us is that we know that the cost agenda is flexible, there are new ideas all the time. We are continually harvesting it for what ideas can we deploy across the company at large. We invest in both short term and long term solutions. The EHR and all this effort to get it up and running, at the end of the day it’s not only going about better care, that’s going to be about more efficient care. These are longer term solutions that we are putting in place. And you know, the general answer I would offer is that it’s our approach to managing cost both in the short term and the long term have provided – have we had a good track record around it and we expect that that’s going to continue to be situation going forward. We are going to take a look at all opportunities as they present themselves and we are going to continue to manage through the different aspects of the business cycle.
Richard Bracken: All right. I think that’s good with that.
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: Thank you.
Richard Bracken: Thanks, Adam.
Operator: Moving on. We will hear from Christine Arnold with Cowen And Company.
Christine Arnold - Cowen And Company: Hi there, just a quick revenue questions, if you are comfortable answering them. HITECH next year, will that be down about $85 million which I think was what you guys been sensing earlier? And then UPL on the quarter please?
Richard Bracken: All right. In terms of HITECH, of course we had the accrual of about $60 million. Mil, you want to—
Milton Johnson: Well, I mean, the HITECH is going to – revenue – what we don’t know yet about 2012 is the fourth quarter of 2012. And of course, at the end of September of 2012 we will be at the end of year two stage one incentives. And then how will stage two incentives work, will they be postponed? Will they be effective? And we don’t–, I don't know those numbers yet. So it's very hard at this point in time to give guidance for the full year 2012 because there is still some uncertainty about the fourth quarter of next year.
Christine Arnold - Cowen And Company: Should each of the quarters, the first three quarters be similar to this year or is there a year-over-year drag each of the first three quarters?
Milton Johnson: Yes, so if you think about the revenue we are accruing $60 million here in the fourth quarter, I would expect that number might move around a little bit, but I would use that as a proxy for the first second and third quarters of 2012 as the amount of revenue we will accrue.
Christine Arnold - Cowen And Company: Each quarter?
Milton Johnson: Yes. Each quarter.
Christine Arnold - Cowen And Company: Okay.
Milton Johnson: And fourth quarter is the one that we're going to have more visibility before we can clarify. With respect to UPL, Texas UPL in the third quarter of this year, we had about $48 million of EBITDA net from the program down about $15 million from a year ago.
Christine Arnold - Cowen And Company: And the revenue, please?
Milton Johnson: The revenue in the third quarter of about $129 million versus $150 million a year ago, down about $20 million to $21 million.
Christine Arnold - Cowen And Company: Thanks so much.
Richard Bracken: Thanks, Christine.
Operator: And now we will hear from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Richard Bracken: Hi, Tom.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Thank you. Good morning. Just following up on Christine’s question there, Texas UPL, am not really so worried or concerned about fiscal ’12, I guess, but can you give us your perspective on maybe some of the changes that are going on down there as we look into fiscal ’13 and beyond, the way the program seems to be getting adjusted potentially? 
Richard Bracken: Either Sam or John you want to talk – I guess, the question is really about the waiver in any updates on the status of the waiver.
Sam Hazen: Well, this is Sam. Let me start out about saying this. We know obviously there are some adjustments, obviously there are some adjustments in the first half of next year related to the fact that after math supplemental funding will not exist. And so that is a bona fide change that we know will occur regardless of what happens with the waiver let’s just say that Texas is trying to achieve with CMS. As it relates to the waiver, to date the state has still not received a waiver from CMS, so I’ll say this, we are in a little bit of state of flux with respect to that program and understanding exactly what the modifications will be and what the implications of those modifications will be. We are actively involved in the process with our representatives at the THA as well as our senior management in Texas. And so as we get more information we will share it, but at this particular point in time we are really at a loss with being able to provide any details.
Richard Bracken: And, I think it goes back to the intent is to try to keep the transition (inaudible) key hospitals hold, we just got to see the final rules and regs, whether not that flies out or not. So, we will be suspect until everything is in writing and once it’s been in writing we will deliver the best prognosis that we can give you on where we think those numbers will go.
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. I’ll let you move on to the next one.
Richard Bracken: Thanks.
Operator: And I’ll open the floor up to Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo Securities.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities: Thanks. You talked about the favourable monthly progression on the service mix during the quarter, can you just talk a little bit more about that, was that just a matter of how the comps played out or do you think you are seeing an impact from some of the implementations of some of the programs that you got?
Milton Johnson: Well, Gary, it’s Milton. I think you are referring to the favourable progression that we saw around managed care and the underlying trends there. I am quite seeing – well we started off below three and progressed up to I think, up to increase of 4.7. Gary, it’s very hard. Some of the – July was no doubt, adversely impacted by the business. We had one less business day in July this year than a year ago, that’ going to affect surgical volumes, especially in managed care surgical volumes and it’s going put some pressure. So we did see that – that’s probably a piece of July downturn. But, as Sam mentioned, and the service mix overall, we are just continuing to see our growth come from the medical admissions – medical volumes and less surgical volumes and that’s what is I think is putting pressure on our managed care to push it below the contracted rate. We expected about 5.5% this year and we are running year-to-date, slightly under that at around 5%. So, I think that’s just most reflective of the service mix that Sam mentioned at this point in time.
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities: But do you think that trend is starting to turn your favour base on monthly progression or it is too early to say?
Samuel Hazen: I think Gary, this is Sam. Our surgical volumes were fairly consistent with previous quarters with respect to decline. We were down somewhere around 1% and that’s about what we have been. What we are seeing is that the admission activity that is being generated in the hospital is more medicine. So the ratio of surgery to total is declining a little bit faster than previous, simply because we are seeing more of the total volume grow from the medical side and so it’s queuing the composite ratio – it’s having an impact on our composite revenue per unit. But, we are able leverage some of that. We just don’t get to leverage it as much from a profitability standpoint, because there is not as much revenue associated with the medicine patient. There was no substantial trend change – it was month to month, over the last few months in our volume with respect to surgical activity or cardiac activity or a critical care activity, so from that standpoint I am not seeing any trend change, it is just that we are seeing is more medicine business and it is a significant portion of our growth and that yields lesser revenue and a little less margin than our surgical business. So that’s really sort of the implication and sort of the trend.
Victor Campbell: Gary, thank you, time for probably a couple more questions before nine.
Operator: Now we will go to A J Rice with Susquehanna Financial Group.
A J Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group: Hello everyone, maybe just a broad question about capital deployment strategies. You guys put a lot of capital to work here in the last three months. But going forward debt pay down versus – I guess you guys have been mentioning about a couple of – at least one big acquisition opportunity in Colorado, how does that affect your end, do you think going forward?
Milton Johnson: A J, this is Milton. I think we will use our free cash flow to take leverage down here over the next several months. We are looking for transactions, we are looking acquisitions that fit our strategy, fit our market. The one that’s mentioned in the quarter down in Colorado, that’s going to – even if that occurs that’s much down the road. So our strategy right now, after taking on the BofA repurchase and HealthONE purchase would be to reduce our leverage at this time.
A J Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay, all right thanks.
Richard Bracken: Thanks A J.
Operator: Moving on we’ll go to Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.
Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets: Good morning. A quick question here with regard to the volume in acute and surgical trends. Could you talk a little bit about – did you see any regional variations from one part of the country to the other? And then the second question is, you mentioned what your managed care book looks like for 2012, for the most part on the rate side, but are you seeing any changes kind of in the structure of those contracts? Thanks.
Richard Bracken:
.:
Samuel Hazen: Yeah, this is Sam Hazen again. If you look at the three groups, I will use that as the geography. I don’t have a map of every division in front of me and it would take while to sort through that. But if you look at the three groups, the one group that had better surgical performance was the southwest group which includes Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Kansas, that group actually saw growth in their surgical admissions in the quarter. The other two groups were consistently down at about 2% with again significant declines in cardiology. I will say this that in the southwest group their cardiology trends were consistent with the other two groups. So, quite a bit of cardiology pressure in Florida based upon some first quarter market share data that we could see and that’s obviously a big book of their business given our position in Florida, so that puts pressure on the national group. And then again the central group was down also at about 2% on a year-over-year basis. So fairly consistent in those groups, a little better performance in Texas, and so we felt slight growth there on our total surgical activity.
Victor Campbell: Richard, do you want address the other question?
Richard Bracken: I would just say that we really haven’t seen any material changes in the structure of any managed care contracts that we have executed.
Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks.
Richard Bracken: Thanks Frank.
Victor Campbell: There would be one last question.
Operator: Our final question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay Great. Thank you. The cost control in the quarter was pretty impressive and you guys went through a lot other things that you’re doing. I guess, I want to get your sense about what you think – how sustainable this 50 basis point increase at least for the next couple of quarters, before you start counting against or is there some extra pressure you would expect, for the next couple of quarters on that line?
Sam Hazen: I am Sam Hazen again. I think as we move through the fourth quarter, we’re fairly confident that we will continue to see similar trends. It can move a little bit depending on equity and so forth, as certain markets have wage adjustments as they put in the last half of the year. So those kinds of things could have a slight impact, but largely we’re confident that we’ve instituted some permanent adjustments that will carry us through the fourth quarter and in some instances on into next year with some of those adjustments. Again, as Richard mentioned, it’s a dynamic process, cost management in a hospital business and as we identify new opportunities, we move to implement those, so there could be additional initiatives that surface as we move through the rest of this year into the budgeting process and on into the next year. But cost management in our business is day to day, it’s reflective of what’s going on from an equity standpoint, a mix standpoint and so forth, and I am confident that our systems are getting better and so we’re encouraged by where we are and we will just continue to be diligent in the effort. I am really not position to give any kind of numbers for next year but I will say that if we move through the fourth quarter, we are pretty confident with where we are.
Richard Bracken: And I think also underlying those keys trends around those metrics would be volumes that we continue with our fixed cost structure to leverage the current volume that we’re seeing and to drive towards a 0.5 or lower sort of a target. Volume is going to be a part of the equation as well.
Kevin Fischbeck – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay great. Thanks.

Operator: Good day a welcome to the second quarter 2011 earnings release conference call. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vic Campbell. Please go ahead sir. 
Victor Campbell: Thank you operator. Good morning everyone. Mark Kimbrough, our chief investor relations officer, and I would like to welcome you on today's call, including those of you listening to our webcast. Here this morning with me are Chairman and CEO Richard Bracken, President and CFO Milton Johnson, and Sam Hazen, president of operations. And there are a number of other members of the HCA senior management team here with us today as well. Before I turn the call over to Richard, let me remind everyone that should today's call contain any forward looking statements, they are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. Many of the factors are listed in today's press release and in our various SEC filings.  Many of the factors that will determine the company's future results are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in any forward looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on those statements. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events.  This morning's call is being recorded. Replay will be available later today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Richard. 
Richard Bracken: All right. Thank you Vic, and good morning to all. We do appreciate your participation on our call this morning. Let me begin today by sharing with you some comments on the quarter. Clearly, our results for the second quarter were very mixed. While it was a quarter marked by continued favorable patient volumes, stable expense management, and favorable cash flow, these positive trends were offset by an unfavorable service mix, negatively affecting earnings. These, of course are the issues that we will address this morning. So let me start with volume. For the quarter, patient volumes, including our newly acquired facilities, were positive and continue to align with recent favorable trends. Reported admissions for the quarter were up 3.2% and reported equivalent admissions increased 3.4%. Similarly, on a same-facility basis, reported admissions and equivalent admissions grew 1.8% and 1.9% respectively.  We have now experienced 15 quarters in a row of positive equivalent admissions growth. On a year-over-year basis, reported admission and equivalent admission growth were also favorable at 2.6% and 3.6%. Also, consistent with strong admission growth, we continued our favorable trends in same-facility emergency visit growth with a 4.5% growth rate for the second quarter and a 7.8% rate on a year to date basis.  And I think that you're generally aware that we believe this growth reflects not only favorable facility locations in areas with favorable growth dynamics, but also an operating agenda that seeks to improve the efficiency in which we process patients through our system. And we remain committed to this strategy as a way to not only improve efficiency but to improve the patient experience and clinical outcomes as well.  From an earnings perspective, however, the favorable volume performance that we did experience in the quarter did not convert to revenues as favorably as they previously have. We believe that this is primarily due to a shift that was experienced in service mix. That is, from more complex cases, significantly surgical cases, to less-acute medical cases.  Importantly, our same-facility cash revenue for equivalent admission increased only 1.2% in the second quarter, down from 2% growth in the first quarter of 2011. We believe this service mix shift accounts for the majority of variance in our quarterly earnings performance. As a net result, our company reported revenues for the quarter totaling $8.06 billion, compared to $7.76 billion last year. Cash revenues, net revenue less bad debt, were up 4.6% for the quarter while same-facility cash revenue grew 3.1% in the quarter.  On the expense side of the equation, same-facility cash expenses for equivalent admission rose 2.9% for the quarter compared to the prior year. This was consistent with our expectations and reflective of the favorable expense trends in our facilities. And Milton and Sam are going to comment on all of this in more detail in just a moment. So as we roll this up for the quarter, adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.42 billion, down 4.7% from the $1.49 billion we reported in the second quarter of the prior year. For the first 6 months of 2011, our adjusted EBITDA is $3.01 billion compared to $3.064 billion in the similar time period of the prior year. Our more favorable performance in Q1 has been offset by less favorable performance in Q2 of this year.  Given this performance, we felt it prudent to refine our overall 2011 guidance. Please recall that we had previously stated a goal of mid-single-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA for the full year. We are now refining that to 3-5% adjusted EBITDA growth.  Let me remind you that this guidance for 2011 excludes any impact from our previously announced HealthONE transaction in Denver as well as any subsequent acquisitions or divestitures or further debt restructuring opportunities, but continues to include anticipated reimbursements from CMS and Medicaid agencies related to the HITECH program.  It is contingent upon the successful rollout of our electronic health records initiative consistent with Stage One Meaningful Use requirements. And as you would expect, there is a significant amount of effort and investment underway to meet these standards and we remain optimistic relative to our ability to do so. Our operating agenda remains robust. We remain committed to investing in necessary technologies, clinical management programs, and physician integration strategies to properly position our company for the future. Additionally, we will continue to develop our Parallon business solutions subsidy as a method of capitalizing on the core competencies that we have developed. We believe these major agendas will drive value for the organization in the future.  From a capital investment perspective, we made a couple of significant announcements during the quarter. First, on May 2, we completed our acquisition of the 473-bed Mercy Hospital in Miami. Mercy brings an annual revenue run rate of approximately $280 million to our East Florida division, which now inclusion 13 hospitals, 12 outpatient surgery centers, a regional laboratory, and numerous imaging facilities, physician practices, and medical education and training programs. Additionally, on June 15 we announced a memorandum of understanding with the Colorado Health Foundation to purchase their approximate 40% equity ownership in our HealthONE joint venture in Denver for $1.45 billion.  Since 1995 we've been joint venture partners in this market. HealthONE is the largest healthcare system in the metro Denver area, with 7 hospitals, 12 ambulatory surgery centers, and more than 30 occupational medicine rehab and outpatient diagnostic clinics and we look forward to completing this transaction and to participating in an appropriate and comprehensive regulatory review process. And so with that, let me turn the call to Milton. 
Milton Johnson: Thank you and good morning. Hopefully everyone has had an opportunity to review the company's second quarter earnings release issued earlier today. Once again, we have included in today's release a supplemental schedule which provides a comparative view of our GAAP revenues and non-GAAP cash revenues in relation to the company to expense items. We believe this is a useful tool in analyzing the effects of uninsured volumes and discounts on our reported revenues and the provision for that account.  The company's second quarter results provide [inaudible] volume growth, good expense management and strong cash flow from operations. However, an unfavorable shift in service mix during the quarter resulted in lower patient acuity, which in turn research in lower revenue growth and earnings.  Net income in the second quarter totaled $229 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, which includes $75 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, of pre-tax loss on the retirement of $1.1 billion of debt called earlier in the quarter. This compares to $293 million in the second quarter of 2010, or $0.67 per diluted share. Results for 2010 include impairments of long-lived assets of $91 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.  Tax rate in the second quarter was approximately 39%, compared to 32% in the second quarter of 2010. The tax rate in the second quarter of 2010 was reduced due to certain tax settlements related to prior years. As noted in the release this morning, shares used for computing our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2011 increased 23% from the second quarter of last year to $538.6 million compared to $437.1 million last year, due primarily to the issuance of shares for the company's IPO in March of this year. During the second quarter, same-facility admission increased 1.8%, while same-facility equivalent admissions increased 1.9% compared to the prior year. As noted in this morning's release, patient volumes in the quarter were driven by higher medical admits of 3.7% while our surgical admissions decreased 1.6%. Consistent with recent quarters, we saw growth in volume from patients covered under governmental programs. Same-facility Medicare admissions and equivalent admissions increased 3.3% and 2.6% respectively, compared to the prior year second quarter.  Our same-facility Medicare admissions include both traditional and managed Medicare. Managed Medicare admissions increased 4.3% on a same-facility basis and represent 23.6% of our total Medicare admissions.  Same-facility managed care and other admissions declined 2.1% in the quarter with virtually all of the declines being in surgeries. However, same-facility managed care and other equivalent admissions were flat in the second quarter as compared to last year. This is the first quarter since 2007 we did not see a decline in managed care and other equivalent admission growth.  Same-facility uninsured admission increased 10.6% or 2,756 admits in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Same-facility uninsured admission represent 7.4% of total admits in the quarter, compared to 6.8% in the second quarter of 2010.  We did see a slowdown in Medicaid conversions from uninsured in the State of Texas. We believe this increased our uninsured growth in the quarter but we expect this affect to be temporary and should reverse later this year. Same-facility total surgical volume in the quarter declined 1%, with inpatient surgeries down 1.5% and outpatient surgeries down 0.6%. Surgical softness is being driven by reduced elective surgeries, which declined 3.3% in the quarter. We also continue to see a shift in certain inpatient surgeries to outpatient settings, particularly in general surgery and gyn.  There has also been some movement of inpatient cases such as AICDs and pacemakers to cath labs as well as endovascular surgeons working in interventional radiology suites and cath labs rather than operating rooms. Same-facility ER visits increased 4.5% in the second quarter as compared to last year. As Richard mentioned, we believe our ER strategy is effective on many fronts, including improving our admission growth. Now a few comments on revenue. Same-facility cash revenues grew 3.1% in the second quarter. As a reminder, cash revenues is a non-GAAP financial measure, and represents reported revenue less the provision for [that account]. Our revenue growth was driven by same-facility equivalent admission growth of 1.9%, coupled with same-facility cash revenue per equivalent admission growth 1.2%. The unfavorable shift in service mix during the quarter was a primary driver of softer cash revenue per equivalent admission. Our same-facility case mix index increased just 0.4%.  Our revenue for the second quarter of 2011 included $39 million of Medicaid incentive revenues related to certain of our hospitals completing [inaudible] to their adoption of certain electronic health record technology.  The most significant contributor to the low cash revenue rate growth from a payer class standpoint was Medicare. Same-facility Medicare revenue per equivalent admission declined 1.3% compared to last year's second quarter and Medicare case mix index declined 1.2% compared to last year. Our analysis found not only did Medicare case mix decline due to fewer surgical cases in the second quarter, but the medical cases had a lower case mix than medical cases during the second quarter of 2010. Comparing the second quarter of this year to the first quarter of this year, the change in Medicare revenue per equivalent admission growth rate yields an approximately $90 million negative impact on revenue growth. Exploring further, we reported a 2.6% growth rate in Medicare revenue per equivalent admission in the first quarter of this year versus a 1.3% decline in the second quarter. The 390 basis point swing in growth rate accounts for approximately $90 million in Medicare revenue difference between the first and second quarter of this year. We quantified this impact by multiplying our second quarter 2011 Medicare revenue by 3.9%. This reconciles a significant portion of our revenue change between the first and second quarters of this year. Same-facility managed care and other revenue per equivalent admission increased 4.9% compared to the prior year second quarter. Medicaid same-facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 1.9%, excluding EPL. Same-facility charity care and uninsured discounts increased by $319 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year. During the second quarter, same-facility charity care discounts totaled $653 million, an increase of $57 million for the past year, while same-facility uninsured discounts totaled $1.33 billion, an increase of $262 million from the prior year. We were generally pleased with expense management in the second quarter, as same-facility cash operating expense per equivalent admission increased 2.9% compared to the prior year. Cash operating expense is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is comprised of salaries and benefits, supplies, and other operating expenses. Salary and benefit expense per equivalent admission increased 4.6% in the quarter on a same-facility basis. Hospital-only productivity performance as measured by man hours per equivalent admission showed an improvement of 1.2% while the company showed an unfavorable change of only 0.4% on a same-facility basis compared to the prior year.  Our wage rate increased 2.7% on a same-facility basis compared to the prior year. We incurred $24 million of cost related to the implementation of our electronic health records in the second quarter.  Supply costs per equivalent admission declined 0.4% on a same-facility basis, benefitting from our contract pricing established by our GPO, Health Trust Purchasing Group, and a decline in surgical volumes and numerous other supply saving initiatives. Same-facility other operating expenses per equivalent admission increased 2% in the quarter, reflecting several small variances from prior year.  Adjusted EBITDA during the second quarter declined 4.7% to $1.42 billion, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.6%. On a cash revenues basis, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.5%, which compares to 21.4% in the second quarter of 2010. The margin decline can be attributed primarily to lower revenue growth and increased physician employment expenses. Same-facility personnel costs associated with our physician management company increased to $243 million in the second quarter of the year, compared to $179 million in the second quarter of last year.  Bad debt plus charity and uninsured discounts as a percentage of revenue plus charity and uninsured discounts was 27.6% compared to 26.1% in the previous year's second quarter. We currently have 93% of our self-pay book reserved. Up front collections totaled $83 million, up 5.5% from the prior year. Cash flows from operating activities increased to $748 million from $436 million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase was primarily due to reduction in the company's cash taxes due to recording of higher revenue deductions on uninsured accts and accelerated depreciation expense on certain capital expenditures. Days in accounts receivable at the end of the second quarter were 45 days, which compares to 44 days June of 2010. Capital expenditures totaled $447 million in the second quarter, compared to $322 million last year, reflecting increases in routine and construction capital. At June 30, 2011, the company's debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.36 times, compared to 4.31 times at March 31, 2011. At the end of the second quarter we had $2.854 billion of liquidity available under our senior secured credit facility.  As previously mentioned, during the quarter the company extended maturities of $594 million of our Term A to May of 2016 and $537 million of our Term A and $1.836 billion of our Term B to May of 2018. Also, the company completed an amendment to our cash flow and ABL credit agreements which will provide additional financing flexibility in the future.  As announced on our last earnings call, the company redeemed approximately $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of certain issues of its high coupon senior secured notes on June 2, 2011. During the quarter, we also entered into an additional $1.5 billion of forward starting swaps. We now have an aggregate of $4.5 billion of swaps, which will commence in mid-November when our current $7.1 billion of swaps expires. The new swaps have an average 3.14 fixed rate versus LIBOR compared to the 4.85% average on our old swaps.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Sam Hazen.
Sam Hazen: Good morning. I'm going to take a few minutes to speak to the performance across our operating divisions.  Again, in the second quarter, as we experienced in the first quarter, the operating performance across the company was very balanced and consistent with with respect to most volume metrics. Fourteen out of 16 divisions grew adjusted admissions on a year-over-year basis. Twelve out of 16 divisions had growth in inpatient admissions.  Of the four divisions that had declined, two were down less than 1%, one was down by almost 2%, and our London division was down because of the festivities around the royal wedding. All divisions once again had growth in emergency room visits for the quarter. As I shared in my comments last quarter, we have a comprehensive strategy across all of our markets to grow emergency room services. This strategy continues to yield solid results for us. The one volume metric that showed inconsistent performance across the company was total surgeries. Only five divisions had growth in total surgeries, with no real geographical patter to this performance. At this point, current period market share data is not available to understand all of the issues contributing to this performance, but some early observations indicate softness because of lingering effects of the economy, some incremental effects potentially from technology and drug enhancements, and some market share swings against us because of physician losses or competitor investments.  Obviously, we believe some of our divisions had share gains because of these same factors. The most recent market share data, which is year-end 2010, for most of the company's markets, shows our overall market share as stable to slightly up in most surgical service lines.  Our growth strategy for surgical services is built on adding physician capacity, improving physician service and convenience, increasing our operational efficiencies, investing in technology and facilities, developing and acquiring outpatient surgery centers, and deepening program capabilities such as adding trauma surgeries. We continually identify we appreciate your support to enhance these program elements and believe in total they position us well to compete for more share in surgical services.  Surgery is just one component, and obviously an important component, of overall intensity in our hospitals. Critical care services are another. For the quarter, the company had growth in admits and patient days in critical care services of 2.5% and 1.7% respectively. This is also the case in our neonatal intensive care units, where admits grew by 0.7% and patient days grew by 3.3%.  Unfortunately, the growth in these services was not sufficient to offset the revenue softness from surgery services and other declines in intensity of services rendered. It is important to understand that our hospitals have very sophisticated management systems to adjust their cost levels to variations and intensities. Our scheduling and productivity systems are all geared to managing fluctuations in both census levels and acuity levels. This allows us to compensate some, but not entirely, for the associated revenue issues from lesser intensity.  Generally, the more intense the service, the higher the operating margin. Our management teams in our hospitals and surgery centers continue to execute a comprehensive agenda of both growth and operational initiatives while at the same time maintaining a tight grip on cost. Finally, the financial performance across the three operating groups was generally consistent for the quarter. That concludes my comments, and I'll turn it back to Vic. 
Victor Campbell: All right. Thank you very much. Operator, do you want to come back on and poll for questions? 
Operator: Yes sir. Thank you. [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of John Rex from JP Morgan. 
John Rex - JP Morgan: I was wondering if you could just drill down a little further for us, specifically on the soft Medicare acuity. I say this mostly because the reads we've had so far from other segments, healthcare just showed a little more upward pressure on government program business in terms of cost trends. I'm wondering if there were any kind of share shifts or position losses that you could particularly point us to that maybe explain what you saw in your Medicare book. 
Sam Hazen: We have certain markets where we know we have lost physician relationships, and that's generated some business loss, but we have other markets where we know we've picked up physician relationships and it is has seen our surgical volumes grow. And when I try to carry that across the whole portfolio, that's not the issue that I can point to in indicating that our surgical activity within the Medicare business was down.  We're really, at this particular point in time, not able to identify anything concrete and as I mentioned in my notes, our most recent data point on very objective data, which is the year end 2010 market share data for just about all of the company's markets, indicates that we in fact have picked up market share in surgical services.  So we don't know exactly if the market's shrunk in the second quarter in overall demand, or if we did in fact lose market share globally. We're just really without an important data point to understand that. But anecdotally, we don't think across the various divisions that that is in fact the case. 
John Rex - JP Morgan: Okay, and I just want to confirm one thing on your guidance revision. I think last quarter you said your EBITDA guidance incorporated for Medicaid a 12% reduction in Florida, a 10% redundant in Texas. Would the revised guidance still accommodate those kind of Medicaid rate revisions? 
Richard Bracken: It does include Florida and Texas, and I think we reported specifically on Florida that effective July 1, we saw a reduction take place of roughly $52 million on an annual basis. So we're looking for about half of that to take place in '11 and the other half in '12. Then Texas came about the time we were on the call. That takes effect September 1. We're estimating that's an annual reduction of somewhere around $25-30 million. So that would mean maybe $8-10 million coming in the last 4 months of '11. Both of those are in our revised guidance. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank 
Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Good morning everybody. I guess I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on the mix question and just get some confirmation from you as to whether or not you think there's any product mix shift going on here as well. We can understand the case mix numbers you've proved to us, but can you just maybe square for us what you're describing as somewhat of a flattish managed care growth. I think you said flat. I think at the same time you said down 2.1. So if you could just clarify those numbers. Is there something else inside the managed care book itself that you're also seeing here? 
Milton Johnson: Just to clarify, the 2.1% decline is in managed care admissions, and the flat is equivalent admissions. And my comment was that for as long as we've been tracking back to '07, we've been seeing declines in the adjusted admission managed care book and had a flat number this quarter which obviously is a positive trend for us.  The case mix index of the managed care book for the second quarter was consistent with the first quarter, up about 1.8-1.9% over the prior year. So no big shift there. Our pricing on the managed care book for the second quarter was up 4.9% and I believe we were up a little over 5% in the first quarter.  So again, fairly similar trends in terms of pricing in managed care. The impact on earnings and our revenue for this quarter is primarily Medicare.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets. 
Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets: Thanks for the color. Good morning. Just curious, now how do we think about going forward? You mentioned your guidance from an EBITDA perspective, but what are you assuming about the Medicare mix trend and is there anything more dramatic you can do on the cost side over and above the daily adjustments that you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you do on a regular basis? 
Milton Johnson: On the revenue front, as we think about the rest of the year, we're seeing - this again is without HITECH revenues, which we've estimated again to be $290 million to $340 million - so excluding HITECH revenue, we would see our revenue growth in the 3-5% range for 2011. So we have, from our previous guidance, which was 5-6%, so we have brought our expectations on revenue down primarily as a result of the second quarter, but also factoring in some of the outlook for the second half of the year. 
Richard Bracken: I think relative to the broader question, that how do we think about the business going forward, you had mentioned on the expense side of the equation, let me just kind of expand that a little bit. How do we think about the business going forward.  We absolutely believe that as we think about over time, years, that there's going to be increased pressure on the system to create more value for the healthcare dollar, and that this will translate into the day to day activities on our part to manage the costs as aggressively as we can. We have a robust cost management agenda. I've talked about this in the past.  And certainly, not only around management of variable cost, which Sam had talked about, but really in terms of overhead costs and reengineering the overall corporate support and shared service platform to bring overhead costs out of the company. We continue to do that in a very aggressive way, and pursue that. But also the way we think about the future is, you know, how healthcare is provided in the future is going to change, and that we have to invest in the technologies and the infrastructure required to position the company appropriately. And that's what we're doing. And we're taking on some serious investment of time and resources now to do so, whether it's in the technologies. We've talked a lot about the HER, the electronic health record, how to digitalize that. That's going to produce a lot of opportunities for us, we believe, as we go forward, but in all the clinical management of the business, as well as the Parallon Solutions to monetize some of these competencies.  We are acting, on a day to day basis, as if there will always be pressure on revenues and we think there are plenty of opportunities to respond to that. They're not even.  I would say on the Medicare case mix index, this is not a static number. But it doesn't move a lot, and it hasn't moved like we saw this quarter. So as Sam had mentioned, we need to wait and see what happens to this number. We weren’t expecting it obviously, but is this going to be a new number? It's just not knowable at this point in time.
Operator: We'll go to our next question, from Justin Lake from UBS. 
Justin Lake - UBS: Just quickly on the same source surgical growth in the quarter. The numbers didn't look that materially different from what you reported in the first quarter on a same-store basis. I'm just wondering if there's any more color you can give us there, whether it was significantly different. And then maybe if you look back historically, when you see this kind of volatility on a quarter to quarter basis in surgeries, does it typically continue for two or three quarters and build up to the run rate, or do we think of this more as white noise? 
Richard Bracken: You've got a good point. We've been seeing declines in our recent quarterly trends in our surgical volume. I think what's happened this quarter is that the overall intensity of the surgeries that we did have also appear to be lower than in prior quarters. And as I said in my comments, even in the Medicare book, even the medical admissions had a lower intensity than they did in the second quarter of last year. So all of those factors resulting in the lower revenue, on the Medicare book, in the quarter versus last quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse. 
Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse: Maybe a little bit more. Can you break down a little bit more of what you put into the complex surgical case bucket? And is there any way to quantify the average revenue for a medical case versus a complex surgical case? 
Sam Hazen: Our case mix on Medicare is about 2.8 for Medicare surgical cases on average. Our medical case mix index is about 1.15. And so you can see the delta between that. Within each of those classes, though, this particular quarter, which we haven't seen historically much, there was declines in both sides of it.  So in other words, the surgical side dropped from where it was, and then the medical side dropped from where it was, and then we had a distribution between the two that was more medical as opposed to surgical as it relates to our trend. And the combination of those factors yielded the softer Medicare revenue that Milton referenced in his comments.  What goes into those surgical cases, just the higher end cases, and these are just sort of categories, obviously cardiovascular cases are particularly acute and yield a very high Medicare case mix. Total joint procedures in the orthopedic side of the equation also generate fairly large surgical case mix components.  Those are two examples of the type of cases that we typically see in our book of business on the Medicare side. And I don't have the exact statistics on each one of those in front of me, but we can get those to you. 
Milton Johnson: I don't have the Medicare, but on cardiovascular surgeries, down 3.7%, and also had a 2% drop in general surgery as well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. 
Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets: I was curious if you could comment, based on where the trends are today, what you can do on the cost side. And maybe the reaction that you made on the cost side, how much of a flow through effect would you see from that in subsequent quarters if the mix of the business stays the same? And then secondly, with all these issues related to cardiology procedures and some of the higher procedures, how much of that do you really relate to recent doc recruiting of more medical and less surgical? 
Milton Johnson: When you look at our cost trends, this year, we've been up on the same-facility basis about 2.8-2.9% for the first six months of the year. And we've done that, productivity, especially hospital only, has been improving.  But we have also continued to invest in the development of electronic health records, rolling out clinical qualify improvements programs as well. And we believe that those investments are central, especially with the HITECH incentive dollars available to us, primarily in the fourth quarter of this year.  So we continue to invest also in technology that again, over time, will allow us to operate the company more efficiently, not only from a quality standpoint but also from a cost standpoint. So I think from an overall standpoint, our cost is being managed pretty effectively considering the investments that we're making.  There's always opportunity to flex, with our volume changes and intensity changes, as Sam mentioned, but right now we continue to invest and will continue to invest primarily in electronic health records. 
Sam Hazen: The second half of your question, I'm not sure I understood. 
Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets: The notion of softness in the high acuity services, is it either you've lost positions that prove high acuity services recently? Or have you recruited an unusually high percentage of medical related specialties lately? Or is it a combination of both? 
Sam Hazen: I don't know that I would say it's either. I don't think our recruitment efforts are excessively oriented toward medical type physicians, nor do I think we have lost any significant number of surgical positions. If anything, we tend to add more on the specialist side, I would submit, than we do on the medical side.  So our development of our physician medical staff, and our capacity, tends to be oriented toward procedures for surgeries and toward the higher-margin business. Our growth strategies are built around that, whether it's development of programs, adding new programs, and so forth. And so the orientation of our growth plan, and thus our physician development, is generally more toward the individuals who do procedures in our facilities. Now we clearly have a primary care strategy with respect to physicians and other components of our network to feed those specialists and to reach into new markets, but I don't think I could sit here and call any disproportionate orientation toward any of those issues.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Susquehanna Financial Group
A.J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group: I wish I could think of a unique way to keep asking the same question, but I can't. Maybe just to ask you about cash deployment. You've got a bunch of debt that's callable later this year, maybe balance sheet management, that's high cost. What are the prospects for making some adjustments there?  You've also got the HealthONE deal. What's an update on when that might close, and what you might need for that, what that might mean for you?  And then I'm going to slip in a part B, which is obviously the Medicaid IT payments in the quarter were not expected at the beginning of the year. Are there other Medicaid IT incentive payments that you think you might get in the back half of the year beyond the Medicare? 
Milton Johnson: As you saw in our quarter, we did have very, very strong cash flow generation, and we certainly believe we have some opportunity with our existing balance sheet to make some improvements and we'll be looking to do that based upon market conditions and taking advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace to restructure some existing debt and to reduce our interest cost going forward. So as the market opportunities present, I would expect that we would do that. 
Richard Bracken: Sam, you want to give a HealthONE update?
Sam Hazen: We are anticipating that the HealthONE transaction will close sometime in the third quarter. We are in the final stages of developing definitive agreements. We will then proceed to the Colorado attorney general for his process, which is yet to be formalized. And we anticipate that the deal will make it through those proceedings and we should be in a position to close sometime in the middle part of the third quarter we think. 
Richard Bracken: And finally, your HITECH question. Milton, you want to…
Milton Johnson: Sure. Our guidance remains on the revenue side the same as we gave in the first quarter: $290 million to $340 million. We did not anticipate the approximately $39 million of Medicaid HITECH that we had in the second quarter. But now we also would expect it third quarter, John, to have what, another …?
John: We expect another $37 million over the remainder of 2011 the year. 
Milton Johnson: Okay, and that's included in our $290 million to $340 million annual guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold from Cowen & Company. 
Christine Arnold - Cowen & Company: Quick question on Texas UPL. I didn't happen to hear that number. What did that look like in the quarter? And then I may be wrong, but I think you were north of 5% managed care pricing in prior quarters, so it looked like it might have taken a step down this quarter. Am I misremembering? Or did managed care pricing take a bit of a step down? 
Sam Hazen: Texas UPL, the EBITDA from the UPL program in the second quarter was $20 million less than in the second quarter of 2010. We had $457 million of EBITDA net in the UPL program versus $77 million a year ago.  The managed care pricing for the quarter, again 4.9%, slightly below our expectation. Our guidance for this year is 5-6%. I believe we were about 5.25%, 5.3%, if I memory is correct for the first quarter. So again, we're slightly under where we expected to be year to date on managed care, but just a few basis points. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo. 
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo: It sounds like from everything that you're saying - I guess Sam, specifically some of the comments that you made - it's entirely possible that this is sort of just the natural variation in the business and that you all wouldn’t be too surprised if it came back in subsequent quarters. Is that a fair way to summarize what you're saying and what you're thinking? Or is that maybe too optimistic? 
Milton Johnson: One way I would maybe frame it, the 1.2% drop in our Medicare case mix index is there's nothing in our trends that gave us a heads up to expect that. If you look back over the years, from time to time, on a quarterly basis, you will see a decline in the case mix index for possibly any payer, but Medicare in particular.  Recent trends have been actually, entire case mix index, and so this 1.2% decline is the largest decline I've seen in a while. So it is unusual. But whether this is a single data point and we will see improvement, or whether this is starting a trend, we just have this data point, so it's hard for us to make that call at this point. But I will describe it as the magnitude of the decrease in a particular quarter as significant compared to recent trends or recent past declines. 
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo: Have you had the chance to look back over the longer history and see if there are any similarities about the current quarter compared to maybe the last time that you did see something of this order of magnitude in the drop off of the case mix? 
Milton Johnson: I do go back and look over some recent quarters and like I said, the typical movement in case mix index for Medicare has been an improving, or higher case mix index. So this is contrary to that typical trend. The decreases, when they did happen, were relatively small. So the magnitude of this change, and how sudden this change has happened, is not something that we could see coming in our trends. 
Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo: And then I guess is it just going to take another quarter, or will you be able to get some data mid-quarter that you would be able to share with us with an update maybe on more detail of what caused it? 
Richard Bracken: I think we'll have to just monitor it as we go. We don't get into interim quarters reporting, and one month doesn't speak for a quarter very well. So my guess is we'll work our way through the quarter and have better guidance for you at that point. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jake Hindelong from Ticonderoga Securities. 
Jake Hindelong - Ticonderoga Securities: Good morning. Just going to try and find one other way to take an angle on the same question I guess. It sounds like lower acuity is factored into the second half outlook. Still, you're getting to 3.5% EBITDA growth. Did you have to make any cost assumptions or any changes to your cost assumptions, to get to that 3-5%? 
Milton Johnson: Yes. We have factored in some cost improvements. We had already made some cost changes already in second quarter that we believe will carry through and benefit the remaining portion of the year. But also, the growth in EBITDA is going to be primarily in the first question based on our projection. And again, most of that growth is coming from the HITECH incentive payments that we expect to receive in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from Citi. 
Gary Taylor - Citi: The first one's going to be so fast, I'm going to ask two. The first one is could you just tell us the 2010 EBITDA number that you're using for your guidance of 3-5% growth? And then my real question is when you think about this year over year weakness, I guess, and the net revenue per adjusted admissions, how do you think about the comparison, and how strong the 2Q of 2010 was on that metric? Because if you look last year, you were still in the midst of making your accounting change of course. So you had weaker numbers, but the 2Q was by far the strongest quarter, so was there anything unusually good about the 2Q from acuity or mix or payer mix perspective that's influencing the year over year comp? 
Victor Campbell: I'll take the easy one, the prior year EBITDA, $5.868 billion. And then Milton, you get the tougher one. 
Milton Johnson: Gary, the only thing I can think of that changed was for the first part of last year we did benefit from what's called the Medicare 72-Hour Rule, which is basically allowing hospitals to unbundle billing for an outpatient, primarily an ER visit, if that patient is admitted within 72 hours of that visit. And we benefited about $8 million or so a month from that rule. That rule was appealed as of the end of June of 2010. So we did have that benefit. Again, that's about roughly $24 million a quarter. It was not something that we felt was material, although it is part of the difference in terms of year over year pickup with respect to the Medicare book. But other than that, I'm not aware of anything else. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom from Raymond James. 
John Ransom - Raymond James: Can you just remind us why the bad debt number jumps around so much quarter to quarter? It was up a lot last year for example. Bad debt was materially higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the first quarter, lower in the first quarter. Could you tell us what your expectation is for bad debt for the back half of the year? Thanks. 
Milton Johnson: There's a lot of movement and one reason we in our 10-Qs and 10-Ks we put so much disclosure around this issue, there is a lot of movement between what's written off as a bad debt, what could be written off above the line as charity or an uninsured discount. Primarily, what drives the variation in bad debt will be the amount of uninsured revenue that we have, and net revenue in any particular quarter. I'd say that would be the major factor. But then there's other changes again around these discounts and charity care, that would cause the variation. So I would ask all the investors to consider those adjustments and the bad debts in totality in looking at those trends, and we present it, I think, very clearly in all of our 10-Qs and 10-Ks to try and allow that information to be as clear as possible.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein from Barclays Capital. 
Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital: Thanks for all of the details as always. Maybe just trying to think about, as you guys think about the disappointment in the quarter, how much of it was from all this mix shift stuff you've talked about. But at the same time, if we think about the uncompensated care coming in slightly higher, and the uninsured admits as a percentage of total, would you say that the mix issues were half?  And then on the mix issues, you spent a lot of time talking about that. But I was just curious, as you talked about the higher acuity cases, you mentioned cardio down 3.7%, but I just wanted to get a better sense for some of the other higher intensity surgeries like ortho and some of the other areas, just so we can put it in the right context. 
Milton Johnson: Bad debt, yes, we did see a little uptick in our uninsured admissions compared to the recent trends. There was a slowdown in the state of Texas with some conversions that specifically happened from Medicaid payments from uninsured into Medicaid. Again, we think that that will work out over the rest of the year with some timing. That's, I think, a relatively modest impact on our quarter. I would not weight the increase in the uninsured volumes 50% of the problem at all. I would put much more of the weighting on this to the mix shift of service issue and primarily in the Medicare payer class is where the disappointment in this quarter would be based. 
Victor Campbell: If you really look at that revenue differential Milton mentioned in his comments, if you look at what we did in the first quarter in the Medicare book, and if you would have had that same NRAA in the second quarter, that was an $85-90 million swing. You take that, put a margin on it, that's your differential for the quarter. 
Milton Johnson: Yeah, surgical volumes in the quarter, I think I mentioned earlier that the drops - cardiovascular surgery down 3.7%. Neuro was basically flat. That's obviously a big one for us. Orthopedic surgery is up 2.4%. Women surgeries down almost 12%. But the biggest decline in terms of number of surgeries is general surgeries where we were down about 2.5%.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Simpson from Morgan Stanley
Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley : A lot of my questions have been answered. But maybe just to think through the quarter, how divergent were the trends from April to June? It sounds like you were able to offset some of this with the focus on costs. Just trying to understand kind of the June run rate. And then as we look to the back half of the year, how should we think about seasonality in EBITDA? Should it look like last year? Or do these dynamics impact it in any way? 
Victor Campbell: Monthly trending - I know we saw this in all 3 months. I don't know if there was a material difference. 
Milton Johnson: It was more material in May and June than it was in April. 
Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley : Okay, and then towards the second half of the year, as we think about EBITDA seasonality, what's a reasonable way to think about that relative to last year's seasonality? 
Milton Johnson: As far as the percentage of EBITDA earned at any particular quarter, I don't know why this year would be different. Typically, the third quarter is the lowest EBITDA quarter. And I don't know why those ratios would change this year. Nothing comes to mind versus those prior year sort of ratios. 
Doug Simpson - Morgan Stanley : So if we used last year and then added in the tech revenues, that would be appropriate.
Milton Johnson: Yeah, my comment was EBITDA, excluding of course any of the HITECH that we'd pull in. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sheryl Skolnick from CRT Capital Group. 
Sheryl Skolnick - CRT Capital Group: Thank you very much. I'm going to try to parse this out. As I'm sure you're aware, the stock is off 15.5%. My calculation, roughly under 4% decline in EBITDA versus expectations in the quarter. You were very clear in your guidance that first part of the year was going to be flat to down EBITDA, and that the mix shift was one of the greatest variables. If I recall your guidance correctly, deteriorating mix was one of the most significant risk that you faced.  So I'm going to ask the question this way, and sort of twofold. One, in your minds, you're clearly taking this seriously as you should. It's the second quarter out of the box. It's less than the Street expected, although I must confess not far off from my estimates, so maybe that's why I'm a little less concerned here.  But is this really the disaster the Street is making it out to be? And if you continue the current trends to the end of the year, would that be consistent with your guidance of EBITDA sort of going up in the neighborhood of 3-5% from the year inclusive of the HITECH payments, which is how I understand your guidance. In other words, basically flat to down EBITDA this year.  And lest we not forget, you did have, if I recall correctly, nearly 5% hit in your payments rate this year that we're absorbing, which is part of the reason for the decline. So the bottom line is to what extent, if we follow the trend through that you saw in the second quarter, for the rest of the year, would that be consistent with your guidance? And B, how much of a disaster is that? 
Richard Bracken: Let me start with this one, and Milton, you can comment certainly on the forecast. Our forecast was our best thinking taking in all of these points on the 3-5% guidance. And relative to the bigger question, is it a disaster, I'm not sure I'd use that word. We were caught off guard like we said about the service mix being as much as it was.  We still think our company is very well positioned as an organization. In my comments I said that how we judged the quarter was - I used the word mix, because there were a lot of very strong trends in the quarter from an operation perspective. Volume continues to do well.  We believe this is a function of our executing our strategies. We like our strategies. We're not backing off our strategies. The investments we are making are expensive, putting this EHR in across 164-5 hospitals is a big expense for the company, and it's consuming a lot of energy and resources.  We're doing it because it's the right thing to do to position the company for the future. Likewise, in physician employment, integration, there is, as you know, a huge push by the medical community to seek employment with facilities and we are careful about how we do that, but it is expense now that we didn't have in the past.  These are appropriate investments to make for a company of our size, and our physicians, and our marketplace. And we're not backing off on it. We point to very strong cash production. We are able to handle this. We didn't like the quarter, clearly. We are looking to continue to manage expenses appropriately. We're looking to reengineer systems and as I think about it, our operating agenda today is the same as it was before the second quarter. It's spot on, and it's where we need to take the company. 
Milton Johnson: Sheryl, your description of our new guidance I think is stated accurately, the 3-5% EBITDA growth is coming from HITECH dollars that we expect to receive, primarily in the first question. Absent HITECH, we would be flattish for this year would be our most recent guidance.  We did give guidance, you're correct, at flat to slightly down for the first, second, and third quarter of the year. I think what this 4.7% decline, when you factor in the Medicaid HITECH dollars in this quarter as well, it's down more than we expected. There's no doubt about that.  As Richard said, we're disappointed with it, but it is far from a disaster. It is something that we will continue to look at all of our operations, but it is below our expectation that we had coming in, but far from a disaster. 
Victor Campbell: All right. I think at this point, we've gone a little beyond an hour, and I think I've heard almost every sell-sider get a pitch question. I apologize if we're missing anybody, but we're going to go ahead and call the meeting. Mark and I are here, obviously, all day, and please let us know if you need to talk about anything. Thank you very much for being on the call.
